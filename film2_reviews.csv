"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch."
"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure."
"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"", ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication.On August 6th, 1945, the atomic bomb ""Little Boy"" was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, making it the first time a nuclear weapon was used in an act of war. The dropping of this bomb and ""Fat Man"" in Nagasaki three days later was what essentially brought an end to World War II, and with it, began a frightening new era known as the ""Atomic Age"". To this day, it remains a contentious topic of discussion among many as to whether the ethical ramifications of these bombings are justified by what subsequently resulted from it. The one man whom most people pin all the blame on is J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose key role in the development of these weapons led to him being credited as ""the father of the atomic bomb"", a label which he carried as a heavy burden for the rest of his life. In Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer"", we are treated to an intricately structured and uniquely tragic analysis of this complex man's legacy and how it still affects everyone several decades later.In true Christopher Nolan fashion, the story is not told as a conventional biopic but rather as a fragmented, non-sequential series of highlights pertaining to the title subject's life. When we are first introduced to J. Robert Oppenheimer, we see that he is an incredibly intelligent man whose sheer commitment to his craft earns him the utmost respect of many of his peers, even as a young student. However, almost immediately after, the film cuts to him on trial for allegedly having ties to communism, an accusation which threatens to completely derail the positive reputation bestowed upon him. As the judicial committee interrogates him with hard hitting questions, Oppenheimer is haunted by the errors of his own judgement, shown to the audience through flashbacks of varying length to pivotal times in his life. These scenes range from his fractured relationship with his wife to the remorse he has for placing his trust in the wrong people. This gives the viewer a first person perspective of what Oppenheimer's mind must have been processing during this intense period of his life, as he contemplates the very real possibility of having all of his hard work mitigated by these powerful government officials. It's hard to imagine any other director trying to convey so much information to their audience in such a fashion, but Nolan manages to work his magic in the best way possible, always striking the perfect balance of showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.Another notable thing about Nolan's direction is his resourcefulness in the way he handles certain important scenes. One moment, which I won't speak about in too much detail, literally had me on the edge of my seat as we watch Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists test out the prototype bombs with each explosion proving to be bigger than the last. Since Nolan has been vocal about his dislike of using CGI in his movies, he instead opts for more practical methods of showing the increasing power of these bombs. By reminding the audience that the Nazis could very well be working on their own weapon of mass destruction, there is a real sense of urgency flowing throughout these scenes, giving the scientists all the more reason to work even faster to beat the enemy at their own game. As each bomb explodes, it can be likened to a ticking clock, with each blast representing progression towards the end goal of perfecting the ultimate weapon. The creative use of editing during these scenes keeps things moving at a brisk pace, something especially necessary considering the film's three hour runtime. Nolan previously exhibited a similar method in 2017's ""Dunkirk"", which utilised the film's score in a clever way to show the audience how time is truly of the essence. Once again, Nolan has found a clever way around taking the easy route of using CG effects to tell a story, and keeps viewers on their toes by use of good old fashioned directorial proficiency.For what can only be described as the performance of his career, Cillian Murphy brings everything necessary to the role of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a man so complex that I can't imagine the amount of pressure there was to play him this effectively. The combined efforts of both Murphy's acting and Nolan's direction help make Oppenheimer one of the most fascinating individuals of the 20th century. This is not a man who can be viewed simply at face value, as there are so many layers to his character that it bears an in-depth exploration that only a movie like this can accomplish. The film paints Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but rather a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for in the history books. Murphy approaches him like that of a Shakespearian figure, rife with flaws, haughtiness, and a sense of hubris that ends up sealing his inevitable fate. One scene may have you admiring his remarkable talents in the field of nuclear physics while another might cause you to hate him for his unfaithfulness to his family. He can be viewed simultaneously as a martyr and a scapegoat for the way in which he helped bring an end to the deadliest global conflict in history, while consequently ushering in something even worse.The rest of the film's cast all did a fantastic job as well, with the standouts being Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh. Damon's take on Major General Leslie Groves is more than simply that of a stock military character but rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. We watch as Groves forms an unlikely alliance with the physicist, often questioning the ramifications of the theoretical nature in experimenting with nuclear power. Groves's ignorance to Oppenheimer's extensive scientific knowledge allows the audience to learn along with him when it is explained in basic detail. To that effect, he provides an important third party perspective to Oppenheimer's achievements.It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr shine as Lewis Strauss, which is not only his best post-MCU role but one of his best roles in general. Strauss is a man who is not viewed favourably by history due to his role in exposing Oppenheimer's ties to communism. He holds such a grudge against Oppenheimer that you can practically consider him the true villain of this story. Downey takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, biding his time for the right moment to strip Oppenheimer from the record books and damage his reputation. Reportedly, Downey considers this his best role to date, and it definitely seems like he is putting everything he has into his performance.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh also contributed significantly as Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. Each of these two women represent something significant in Oppenheimer's life, with Kitty being who he should be with and Jean being who he personally wants to be with. This draws parallels to that of Oppenheimer choosing between acting on instinct or acting on intellect when assisting in the construction of the bomb, which again reminds the audience of his flawed human qualities. It can be difficult to give up following your heart but when the fate of the world rests on your pragmatic decision making, sometimes you have no other choice.As a biopic and a Christopher Nolan film, ""Oppenheimer"" exceeds virtually all expectations to become one of the very best in both fields. There are few films that are able to tackle such subject matter in this much detail while also remaining entertaining the whole way through. I guess sometimes all it takes is one brave, risk-taking filmmaker to prove that this really is a possible task. We need more films like this to inspire thoughtful, creative discussion and it is comforting to know that someone like Nolan is here to help keep them in the mainstream. After all, it's a tough job, but someone's got to do it for us.I rate it a perfect 10/10."
"This movie is just... wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this watching a movie! Its like a blend of being sad but also scared! I read that Christopher Nolan said it kind of had themes of horror, and watching the movie i think I knew what he meant! Very few movies can make you feel quite like this one can!Nolan once again shows he is an expertly craftsman in filmmaking! This stands as perhaps one of his more humble movies but also one of his greatest! Reminds me of his earlier movies!The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!The soundtrack, sound and editing is also masterfull and further creates a cinematic experience like no other!Overall an esential viewing experience about historic events that still remains very relevant to this day! One of my favorite Nolan movies!"
"I was familiar with the Manhattan project and the social and political aftermath, so ""Oppenheimer"" was an excursion into known territory.Is it Nolan's finest movie to date? Not really. Because I know he can do even better. Does it touch upon greatness? Yes, a couple of times!THE GREAT +++Cillian Murphy gives one of the most surprising leading man performances in ages and just might win an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. He fully transforms into the highly complex and increasingly conflicted man, his eyes ooze tension, his voice is on point, and his demeanour is congruent.The entire 2nd act (the building of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos laboratory and the eventual detonation of the first atomic bomb) is the best part of the movie.Oppenheimer's shaken and stirred speech after the Trinity test is arguably the most engrossing and immersive movie-making of this summer.Great Hollywood actors and actresses galore.Many poignant time jump edits.The scene with Oppenheimer and president Truman in the oval office.Hair and make-up department convincingly depicts Oppenheimer (and some of the rest) from student years to the last stages of their lives.In (surprisingly) typical Nolan fashion, the very ending is a satisfying (if slightly fizzled by the 3rd act) ""twist"" that was being built up throughout the movie.THE NOT SO GREAT ---At least 60% of the movie is a dissapointing bait-and-switch. It focuses way too much time on Oppenheimer's pre-Trinity political activity and post-Trinity kangaroo trial without a satisfactory reason to do so. The 1st and especially the overly long 3rd act of the movie needed tighter editing and the movie would have been better for it. The build-up to the powerful ending of the movie could easily be slightly modified and still pack the same if not an even bigger, much needed gut-wrenching punch.The movie is overly dense because it tries to jam-pack too much of Oppie's pre- and post-Trinity life into one movie. Nolan adds a plethora of new characters we can just barely remember and his time jump edits are sometimes unnecessary and hard to follow.Not nearly enough of the movie is about the actual technical feat of building the first atomic bomb."
"I may consider myself lucky to be alive to watch Christopher Nolan Works which get better by years.Oppenheimer is - with no doubt- going to be one of the best movies in the history. Amazing cinematography, Exceptional acting and terrifying Soundtracks.All the cast are great from cilian Murphy who is going for the oscar with this role to Rupert Downey jr and Emily blunt and finally rami malik who has small scenes but you will never forget them.I didn't watch it in Imax as i couldn't wait and ran to the nearest cinema but now i will sure book an imax ticket.Don't waste any time, book your ticket and Go watch it.. NOW."
"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end."
"Oppenheimer might be the best film I watched in a long, long time.Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon."
"Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves."
"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so."
"Is it just me or did anyone else find this movie... I hate to say it... boring?. I know I know it's a piece of history and don't get me wrong it was a good movie but idk, going in the theater expecting something ""Nolanesque"" and it never came so I was kind of a disappointed. I was super excited going in the theater and leaving I was like ,yeah it was good buuuuttt. I guess I was expecting something like inception and or interstellar but those are fictional and I get that this is based off of a true story . I think everyone should watch this movie once and it was very eye opening but I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour movie experience again . It's a one and done movie and I do respect Oppenheimer. Extremely good acting with a boatload of good actors . I also do want to say that there was nothing very IMAX about the movie so you could go to a regular theater and be just fine . Also Emily Blunts ending scene was amazing . All in all I would go as far as to say it's the most boring Christopher Nolan movie but it is a very good movie let's leave it at that . I still give the movie an 8."
"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10."
"God what an absolute mess. To all the people saying ""you need to pay attention and have your brain fully switched on""... that doesn't make this ""intelligent film"". It makes it an overcomplicated nightmare. Nolan's movies have gone so far downhill since Dunkirk. The mess of 3 timelines is not needed for the entirety of every film. It works well for the majority of inception, the climax of the dark knight, parts of interstellar- but this? Not at all.Nolan desperately needs a writing partner that tells him ""NO"". This film would've been so much stronger with 40 less minutes of chatter before the bomb test, and 30 minutes less after the test. I absolutely LOVE long, ""boring"" movies. I'm a freak for Malick or Reichardt, but this? I would've left if I wasn't with friends.Nolan has a difficult time when directing anything slightly out of his comfort zone. The scene of Florence Pugh in the chair during the interview, the overdramtic yells of Emily Blunt, both had me biting my fist in cringe.No amount of quick cuts or dramatic music were able to convince me I was being entertained."
"Authentic audio-visual journey to the era of the birth of atomic genesis, which both terrifies and astonishes you with its nonlinear storytelling thanks to Christopher Nolan's masterful approach to direction and screenplay! The pacing of the movie is simply brilliant especially in the moments where the main theme by Ludwig Göransson kicks in! It's a future classic that will not leave you indifferent and will immerse you in the Homeric biography of the notorious scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer! Definitely a 10/10 for the artistic contribution to the history and art of audio-visual media depicting an extraordinarily important event for humanity and the present day!"
"I just got out of OppenheimerI have started to worry about Oppenheimer, as I have seen the trailer every time I have gone to the cinema. Usually, that happens with a movie that is awful and will tank.But Christopher Nolan has done it. Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning may now be my second favourite movie of the year. I'll need to see it again, to make surw.Cillian Murphy is brilliant here. He really made me feel for Oppenheimer, who isn't really a likeable lead character character. Surely an Best Actor Oscar nomination is imminent.Robert Downey Jr is amazing, he delivers a Best Supporting Actor nomination performance!! Admittedly I'm biased, as I have always been a fan. But this is not fan bias, you can not take your eyes off him, when he is on the screen. Again, not playing particularly likeable man.Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Josh Harnett are all great. Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, the kid who played The Green Goblin in the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies (his name is annoyingly escaping me now) and Rami Malek are great too, but they don't have much screen time.I really enjoyed the score too, and for the first time in a while, with a Nolan movie, I had no problems hearing the dialogue.This really won't be for everyone, it's a dialogue heavy, slow burn that feels it's 3hr run time, a lot of people were running to the toiletFor me, it needs to be seen more than once, as I defo didn't take everything in. It reminded me of Oliver Stone's JFK, which I love."
This movie pretends to be clever and artistic but in reality it's just a meandering bloated effort. The cast is wonderful and their performances do have merit there's no question about that. The fault is the story itself. You get the feeling that Christopher Nolan is such a big time director that no one around him has the guts to tell him no. When you surround even the most talented people with Yes Men the result is often inferior. Such is the case with this movie. The story is told through semi flashbacks and a jumping time narrative. What results is unsatisfying and what is seen has very little depth. They try to paint two historical figures back and forth as flawed protagonist yet fail in the delivery.
"This movie is a cinematic masterpiece!The acting, storytelling, the score and visuals were just amazing in it.This movie proves that Cillian Murphy is a lead actor. The deliverance and his eye movement was a treat of it's own. I couldn't have picked a better actor to play Oppenheimer.RDJ showed us that he can still roll with the big boys of the industry and everyone was just amazing in it.This movie isn't just a story how the atomic bomb was made, but also how Oppenheimer and the entire staff of his scratched and clawed to ""victory"". As a viewer, you immediately join them on this adventure and you feel every bit of tension in this film.The trinity test was the highlight of the movie. It took my breath away and made me feel part of the crew as they saw the bomb explode in front of their eyes.If you had any doubt watching it, don't hesitate!WATCH IT IN IMAX AND I GUARANTEE YOU WILL LEAVE THE THEATER WITH THE BEST IMAX EXPERIENCE YOU'VE EVER HAD!"
"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10."
"My Review - Oppenheimer
My Rating Ten plus 10/10
In Cinemas nowIf there were to be a movie to represent the last one hundred years of existence on our planet to be placed in a time capsule and opened in 100 years time if by any chance our planet is still in existence it should be Oppenheimer.This is truly an astonishing achievement in Cinema storytelling covering a wide arc of world events and the personalities that played pivotal roles in the 20th Century that affect us today many that are still responsible for the fear and instability around the Globe.Oppenheimer written and directed by Christopher Nolan is a chilling disturbing but engrossing movie to sit through 3 hours but it's very so very enlightening.I found it Shakespearian in its portrayal of human folly and the pursuit of power that corrupts when jealousy and lies spread like cancer to undermine reputations .Detestable characters like Hitler, J Edgar Hoover , Senator Joseph McCarthy ,Mussolini are mentioned to establish a timeline by name but don't appear in Oppenheimer however their influence and the consequences of their tyranny is obvious as we examine the life of Julius Robert Oppenheimer from 1927 when he studied physics in Germany returning to America where he was eventually recruited in 1942 to work on the Manhattan Project.In 1943 Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Manhattan project situated in the desert of New Mexico where the Los Alamos Laboratory and town was specifically built for one purpose. The personnel at Los Alamos under Oppenheimer were tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.The second half of Oppenheimer I found the most compelling as the inventor of the most destructive force ever unleashed on our planet is sidelined and vilified after the terrible and deliberate destruction of the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan that ended one war but as we know today did nothing to end war on our volatile planet.The Oppenheimer quote appearing at the beginning of the movie -, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"", sums up his suspicion guilt and fear after the destruction of the two cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima that President Harry Truman chose to destroy while glibly commenting that he would spare Kyoto because it's a beautiful city that he and his wife shared a wonderful honeymoon .After these events Oppenheimer is vilified and investigated by the Communist witch hunts of the 1950's when many of his ego driven and powerful adversaries summon him to testify at hearings to prove he's not a traitor.The performances in Oppenheimer are all stunning what a cast that includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. ,Matt Damon ,Kenneth Branagh , Tom Conti, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek and Casey Afffleck.The four standout performances for me were from Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role of J Robert Oppenheimer his is truly an Oscar worthy performance . He is so impressive as the quiet but complex scientist whose problematic wife Kitty played by Emily Blunt in one of her finest performances has moments in this movie that should also earn her an Oscar nomination.The other standouts for me are Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss a vindictive and complicated associate of Oppenheimer who betrays his friend for the sake of ambition.The look of this movie is also impressive especially on a huge screen like our local GMax . Interestingly Oppenheimer is the first ever IMAX film partially shot in 65mm black and white celluloid which Kodak developed and the first ever film stock for IMAX as a process in order for the black and white footage to look the same quality as the rest of the movie.I can only sum up by saying Oppenheimer for me is the finest and most interesting biography movie I've seen in the cinema in many years and congratulate Christopher Nolan on what I think is his greatest movie yet."
"It's isn't a masterpiece. It's a decent biopic about an interesting person, has some good performances, and it's probably about 30 minutes too long.Much better than some of Nolan's recent outings where he's disappeared up his own backside trying to be overly ""clever"" so his fans can feel smarter than they actually are.The movie does well to take subjects like quantum physics and not become bogged down in trying to stroke it's own intellectual ego.It will be a surprise if Murphy and Downey Jr aren't front runners for acting awards in 6 months. Others like Emily Blunt are very good but have too little screentime to really get into their roles."
"Anything that Nolan is involved in, I will go and see, the track record is enough to get me through the doors and on that seat.Oppenheimer represented something of a challenge to me the first time round, after a busy day at work, I went to see it, and at three hours long, after Barbie, it was too much, last night I watched it properly for the second time.As a casual viewer, it's a tough one, but if you're engaged and prepared, this is one outstanding movie. I am on no doubt whatsoever that this film will do very well in terms of awards, the whole cinema was totally immersed, the room was silent.The pacing builds as the film progresses, the second half was the best part, and I loved the ending.It gives some fascinating insight into the life and times of J. Robert Oppenheimer, most of which I knew nothing about, he's a genius, but like all of us, flawed.Cillian Murphy delivers an outstanding, award winning performance, his body language, his delivery, his sheer presence is sublime. Emily Blunt also stood out, she was terrific.I was happy to watch a second time, and no doubt, I'll gladly watch it on blu ray soon enough.9/10."
"This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie. Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I have seen this decade."
"I'm a big Nolan fan. Maybe this one just wasn't for me.This movie was promoted as the story of the invention of the bomb. We were told we should see it on the biggest screen. Go out of your way for an IMAX 70mm projection if you can, or at least get a regular 70mm or Laser IMAX.It turns out, that while Nolan's visuals still look good in this movie, there's nothing breathtaking that warrants those formats. It's like a 1 Michelin star, if your local theater has those formats, might as well go for it, but that's probably true for any movie.It also turns out that this is mostly the story of political vendettas and the marketing of bombs exploding had little to do with the movie, the whole trailer is really just one scene. I guess there wasn't a more interesting way to approach the Los Alamos part of the story. What could he do, focus on the scientific challenges? Not really the best source for a story.We get the review of Oppenheimer for a security clearance, which leads to his retelling of his history in flashbacks, which is why the story of creating the bomb is told as well as his personal relationships (I guess because she was a communist party member, the character played by Pugh is naked all the time, not sure why that was necessary) while at the same time we get a much shorter story of the confirmation hearings of Strauss, with a few flashbacks to a couple of meetings he was involved in with Oppenheimer .It's a political drama, with not much drama. There isn't enough emotional connection to the characters to care about it. Will Oppenheimer lose his security clearance? Will Strauss get served by karma at his cabinet confirmation hearing? Who cares? If you're not invested in any of the characters, why would you care about what happens to them in the end?Maybe this is the best one can do with the source material. Maybe the mistake was wanting to tell that particular story. Maybe better writing and staying away from the gimmick of two timelines of flashbacks intersecting could've told the story better. Maybe it's time for Nolan to let go of those gimmicks in his movies and trust his subject matter.Unlike previous Nolan movies, I won't be thinking about this movie much or wanting to watch it again to understand it better. There's just nothing else in there.For me, this isn't one of his top movies. Technically it's great, the acting is also great, the writing and editing just isn't there.Also, IMAX is great, but not every movie benefits from it. This one really didn't. Maybe if Nolan wasn't so focused on the technical side he'd be able to get me emotionally invested in this story.Edit:I had to come back and add a comparable movie that does a much better job and shows you can tell this story with real tension.The Imitation Game.A movie about a genius trying to solve a problem during the same war. That topic is just as science heavy and the movie goes into his personal struggles, relationships and the personal consequences he suffered because of the politics of the time.The tension is focused on the task of breaking the German code. Not on what will happen to the lead characters years later. It's a lot easier to be invested in that (even though we know who won that war) vs. The results of some political hearing."
"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day. I'm endlessly sad that I have to wait another three years for a new Nolan movie, and hope that he switches back to something more intriguing than the life of a scientist.(1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/20/2023)"
"Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the lead role (Oscar worthy,I'll say) and he's ably supported by a terrific ensemble cast- great to see James Remar again.The film poses many moralistic questions about the bomb and the repercussions this has on Oppenheimer and this is where the film works best for me especially in the (never seen) moment when it's dropped on Japan, the sound and the nightmarish looks on people's faces are horrific.However, at 3hrs it's tedious, talky and frankly rather boring.The sound is good but visually it didn't need to be made into IMAX.It's better than Tenet and was nice to see it with mum and dad."
"Nolan is back and delivers a fast paced thrilling biopic that will leave you stunned.the cinematography, sound design, score all exceptional. Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals. The IMAX experience for this one is a must.You will need to stay focused because the film moves very quickly with sharp snappy dialogue."
"Everybody involved with the production of 'Oppenheimer (2023)' is working at the highest conceivable level, practicing their craft so adeptly that it's hard to express just how impressive their efforts truly are. There isn't a weak link in the entire chain; everything is at the highest standard imaginable. The writing, the directing, the editing, the score, the cinematography, the sound design, the special effects, the costuming, the set design, the casting, and the acting - oh, the acting - is all impeccable. This film is exactly what it was always intended to be. If it doesn't clean up at the Oscars, I'll eat my shoe* or, more realistically, I'll be very surprised.However, that doesn't mean it's perfect. More specifically, it doesn't mean it moves me enough to declare it one of the best movies ever made (as so many others seem to have). It isn't even Nolan's best, although there is a good argument to be made that it's his most accomplished. Essentially, the dilemma at play here is that this is undeniably prestige filmmaking that's pretty much technically flawless, but it's just missing that intangible oomph to catapult it into any of my all-timer lists.Some of its weak points, most - if not all - of which are choices rather than mistakes, are as follows: the sound mixing, while markedly improved from 'Tenet (2020)', is balanced so it favours music and sound effects over dialogue, which is fine and dandy for the big explosion-type stuff but is sometimes irritating when it comes to the quieter dialogue-driven scenes (which take up 80% of the runtime); the editing is pretty relentless and the entire affair feels a bit like a trailer, which in turn makes the feature feel even longer than it already is (at three hours, that's not something you want) and can sometimes keep you at a bit of a distance from the narrative; the opening is quite underwhelming because it feels more like a rote history lesson than an actual story and is far more generic than the movements it precedes (thankfully it isn't too long before the flick finds its feet); sometimes, the actual mechanics of what's going on get lost in the background and, as such, the Manhattan Project almost feels ancillary to the narrative's exploration of the politics surrounding the protagonist's vague association with the communist party; the picture doesn't delve into Oppenheimer's psyche as much as it should considering that the sequences in which it does are easily the most successful in the entire affair; and the female representation is noticeably really weak across the board, with Florence Pugh's well-performed but perfunctory character - as crude as it sounds - only really existing to show her breasts and give the male hero something to feel guilty about.Having said that, there are plenty of things to like here (as my first paragraph ought to suggest). Nolan's never been an especially formalistic filmmaker when it comes to specific scenes and the way in which they're crafted, as his formalistic achievements are usually reserved for the ways in which he structures his films (i.e. How he plays around with chronology to, for instance, create a sense of escalating tension or put you in the headspace of the protagonist). That's true of this picture, too, but here he also tries his hand at some notably fanciful sequences that utilise surrealist elements to further enhance the feeling they're intended to provoke (and, in some cases, represent). One of these scenes, in particular, even outshines the inevitable trinity test, which is itself a masterclass in ratcheting tension and explosive payoffs (pun intended). That this artistic moment prevents the movie's most obvious attraction - the impact of which can be measured not in kilotons, but in megatons - from being the actual highlight of the overall affair is a testament to the sheer success of Nolan's directorial decisions. That's not to downplay the tangible awe inspired by the dropping of the bomb in New Mexico, which truly is a sight (and sound) to behold. It's incredibly impressive that the effects were mainly captured in camera, using a variety of techniques such as miniature photography and full scale pyrotechnics. The sound (or, at least, some of it) was also apparently not recreated in a studio but recorded on set. For how almost nonchalantly these visceral elements are presented, appearing as just another part of the world crafted for the overall immersive experience, they're undoubtedly and almost unimaginably astounding.The film is a veritable who's who of Hollywood: almost every character who pops up, no matter how small their role in the overall story, is portrayed by someone recognisable. There are more stars in this thing than in the night sky and the acting is absolutely brilliant across the board. Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Benny Safdie, Tom Conti, Josh Hartnett, Jason Clarke and David Krumholtz are highlights, but Robert Downey Jr. Is an awards-worthy standout who comes second only to the picture's phenomenal leading man. Cillian Murphy commands the screen with his understated yet powerhouse performance, carrying the weight of the atomic-sized affair with ease. If he doesn't win the Best Leading Actor Oscar, there's something seriously wrong.Even at three hours in length, there really isn't all that much filler. Perhaps it's because of the way it's edited, but it feels as though the events it depicts have actually been somewhat truncated to fit the runtime. Sometimes, it feels as though it's been on for longer than it actually has simply because it crams so much into its duration. On the flip side, huge chunks of it also occasionally zip by in what seems to be an instant. The pacing doesn't leave much breathing room, which ensures there's never a dull moment - at the cost of there never really being time to fully digest what's happening in any given scene (it actually doesn't even feel as though there are individual scenes, per se). Even though it is arguably a bit too long, it's also hard to pinpoint exactly what ought to have been removed to reduce its length. It tells its story in a fairly efficient way and features a number of key turning points that prevent it from ever feeling stale. It's often really compelling and, although it obviously has segments that are far more successful than others, it's generally engaging even during its driest moments. It helps that it's a fairly nuanced exploration of its heavy topic, dancing through the moral minefield of its subject matter without ever pushing its own opinion on its audience. It knows there are no easy answers and, by pushing you to confront your own feelings on the issue and perhaps even attempt to decipher what you'd do in the same situation, it manages to convey somewhat of an understanding of the absolute impossibility of the situation it depicts. It creates a great deal of empathy for its protagonist, someone who is easy to blame for the atrocities committed with the weapon he is credited as being the father of, without attempting to absolve him. It might make you reconsider your opinion of him, but it definitely doesn't force you to.In the end, though, this does lack that hard-to-identify element that would make it really resonate with me. I can't quite say what it is, but something stops it from truly hitting me in my core. It isn't all that emotionally affecting and sometimes it isn't wholly gripping. It's often thrilling, but it doesn't quite sink its hooks into you enough to stay with you for long after it's over. I'm not pining to watch it again and I don't think it will remain seared in my brain for too long. It's great, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't quite rise to the standard of Nolan's best work, even if there's an argument to be made that it's his most accomplished.*I definitely won't be eating my shoe, no matter what happens at the Oscars. Who do you think I am? Werner Herzog?"
"Greetings again from the darkness. As pupils slouched in our school desks during history class, we easily and naturally disassociated with the many stories of war. World War II was lumped in with WWI, the Civil War, and The Revolutionary War. There were names and dates to memorize for quizzes and final exams, yet even with relatives recounting stories of kin, a personal connection was rare. As we aged and experienced modern-day warfare, the personal connection became all too real. Reality struck that soldiers are human beings with families, and despite their missions and marching orders, most are as innocent as the 'tragic civilian casualties' reported on the newswires. Along these lines, an aspect of war that has often remained overlooked is the behind-closed-doors decision-making of politicians and military leaders. Filmmaker-extraordinaire Christopher Nolan takes us behind those doors through the eyes of J Robert Oppenheimer, the Father of the Atomic Bomb. What we see is quite frightening.Prepare yourself. At a full three hours in length, Nolan's film is a hefty undertaking for viewers. It demands full focus and attention to details and nuance, as you spend significant time listening to brilliant men talk amongst themselves. Nolan adapted the screenplay from the 2005 biography, ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer"", written by Kai Bird and Martin Sherman. The end result is a film centered on complex physics and mathematics, yet presented in a simplified manner such that it's much more a character study than a science class. The key is what characters say to each other, how they say it, and how they debate and rationalize the morality of the objective ... building a bomb designed to kill people.The morality of The Manhattan Project is under the microscope here, as is the motivation and concern of Oppenheimer. We get some early background establishing him as an upcoming mind in the world of physics from his academic stops around the globe. Some know Cillian Murphy from ""Peaky Blinders"" or as Scarecrow in Nolan's Batman movies. I'd also recommend a couple of Murphy's underrated gems: FREE FIRE (2016) and RED EYE (2005). It's hard to overstate how spot on Murphy is as Oppenheimer. He lost weight for the role and captures the distinctive movements and speech patterns, as well as the familiar poses and deep-in-thought eyes. We never once question whether this is Oppenheimer, the leader of the science team at the Los Alamos Lab and the Father of the Atomic bomb ... the one who ""sees beyond the world we live in.""
Once Major Groves (Oscar winner Matt Damon) recruits Oppenheimer to run and assemble the great scientific minds, the obvious question to those involved is ... even if we can create this bomb, should we do it? This weighs heavily on Oppenheimer - a man so engulfed by science that his haunting visions are that of atoms and particles and experimental reactions (perhaps a bit too heavy in the first act). Groves is the military leader of the project and the liaison between the scientists, the military, and the government. It's also clear that while Oppenheimer's brilliance is recognized and necessary to the project, almost no one outside of the scientists trusts him. This is where antisemitism and fears of communism arise. Oppenheimer was Jewish and, though he never joined the communist party, was associated with many who did. This included his love interest, Psychiatrist Jean Tatlock (the fabulous rising star Florence Pugh), his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), and his brother Frank (Dylan Arnold).The teamwork and stress involved with building the bomb in Los Alamos is conveyed as rooms full of brilliant minds determine the future path of the country and the world. This culminates in the stunning sequence of The Trinity Test near Alamogordo. A blending of complete silence, along with spectacular sound and light, is truly a technical highlight of the film. The initial celebration of success initially overshadows the true meaning ... the bomb is now ready for Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing two hundred thousand people and essentially ending WWII, less than four years after the bombing of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese (never mentioned here).The bombings are heard via radio news reports, and it's at this point where the weight of what the scientists have done is fully realized. Oppenheimer became a national hero and his Time Magazine cover proves it. A meeting with President Harry S Truman (Oscar winner Gary Oldman sporting a Missouri accent) doesn't go well, as Oppenheimer is introduced to political gamesmanship, something he would face even more directly in the near future. Lewis Strauss (Oscar winner Robert Downey Jr) is a key player as chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission, and through him, we witness ego, ambition, and petty behavior that leads to a level of vindictiveness typically only seen at the junior high level.Multiple timelines are covered. There is the background information on Oppenheimer's early years, his well-rounded academia, his love life (lives), his building of the Los Alamos lab team, the overseeing of the bomb development, his time as a hero, the later backroom kangaroo court designed to disgrace him, and Strauss' Senate Confirmation hearing for Secretary of Commerce. All of these tie together, and it's those final two that make up the last act of the film - giving us a taste of just how nasty politics was 70 years ago (not unlike these days).Nolan has assembled a deep cast with numerous Oscar winners and a roster of talented actors. Among the familiar faces not already named above are: Oscar winner Kenneth Branagh as Danish Physicist Neils Bohr, Oscar winner Rami Malek as experimental physicist David Hill, Oscar winner Casey Affleck as Military security advisor Boris Pash, Tom Conti as Albert Einstein, Benny Safdie, Dane DeHaan, Jason Clarke, Josh Hartnett, David Krumholtz, Matthew Modine, Alden Ehrenreich, Scott Grimes, Tony Goldwyn, James D'Arcy, James Urbaniak, Olivia Thirlby, James Remar, and (Nolan regular) David Dastmalchian.The film is a historical biopic and also an unconventional thriller. Is this about unparalleled advancement in science or is it about the moral dilemma of mass destruction and death? Politics, military, ego, power, science, love, revenge, and redemption are all displayed as Oppenheimer struggles with the power he has created and the lack of power in how it's used. My favorite line in the film is aimed at Oppenheimer when someone informs him that he's now ""not just self-important, but actually important."" The stakes are clear during the test when it's stated that there is a ""near zero"" chance of destroying the world.Cillian Murphy is a shoe-in for a Best Actor nomination, and his performance mesmerizes us. It's nice to see Robert Downey Jr remind us of his true talent, and he should be rewarded with a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt, in the only two substantive women roles, should both receive consideration as well. Pugh's role is limited but memorable, while Blunt shines in her best scene during the security hearing.Christopher Nolan has delivered near perfection in technical movie-making, and on top of that, the story and characters are real life, and the performances are top notch. His use of Black & White film for Strauss' perspective allows the viewer to differentiate the Oppenheimer viewpoint. Impressively, while there are some visual effects, Nolan has stated that no CGI was used in the film, and that's most evident in the relatively short closing credit roll - where we typically get dozens if not hundreds of technical experts listed. Ludwig Goransson's (Oscar winner for BLACK PANTHER) score packs an emotional punch, and Jennifer Lame's editing is excellent and vital. Lastly, cinematographer (and regular Nolan collaborator) Hoyte Van Hoytema drives home the power of smart men in a room, as well as the devastation of the bomb test. This is excellent filmmaking and a reminder that the only thing we love more than lifting new heroes onto the pedestal of worship is tearing down those same heroes with a dose of humility. These types of movies rarely get produced these days, so here's hoping enough people go back to the theater to see it to inspire more filmmakers to take a shot.Opened nationally July 21, 2023."
"Dr. J Robert Oppenheimer the creator of Atomic Bomb and his role in Manhattan Project in R&D for Nuclear weapon. The movie is the Biography of Dr. Oppenheimer.Cillian Murphy portrayed brilliantly as Dr. J Robert Oppenheimer. His eyes and face expressions were outstanding.Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, Florence pugh and the rest of the cast were fantastic.This is a very matured Realistic 'A+' movie that is made ones in life time.Cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema is phenomenal. Each frame of the movie looks breathtaking especially in IMAX screen. He is indeed one of the masterful Cinematographer.Ludwig Goransson Back Ground Music is heart thumping and beautifully sound designed.Editing by Jennifer Lame is fantastic. The 3 hours run time of the movie felt like shorter.Christopher Nolan is one of the Masterclass movie maker who exist. He is the writer and the creator of this monumental.The Practical effects and doing an explosion of A bomb for a movie is absolutely insane (in a positive sense). He is the Gutsy remarkable film maker who can make the movie experience to be remembered forever.Oppenheimer deserves 10/10A true Masterpiece in all aspects."
"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema."
"Imagine a fire that you brought from the heaven and you give that fire to human , and that fire is used by humans to burn this world.Oppenheimer is not an easy historical character to play, he is a historical character full of regret and guilt. However, Murphy plays this character perfectly, his eyes filled with those emotios, the way he responds to every other supporting character's utterances is simply outstanding. Even if his only response was eye movement, or a blank stare in an uncertain direction, Everything can be understood. Also, His body gestures also complement his extraordinary acting.""They won't fear it, until they understand it, the won't understand it, until they use it."" A sentence that explains the dangers of a nuclear bomb. And the way he conveyed it really looked real and as if he already understood what was going to happen.He also played Oppenheimer's flaws perfectly, He's a pretty selfish and sometimes rebellious guy. Committing adultery with a woman who is not his wife, and has feelings that are very binding with his that girl, When the woman's death, we can see that Oppenheimer was devastated.Then for the scoring, It's really amazing. First it sound so grand, The atomic bomb is a very grandiose thing, But over time the music got louder and louder, shows a very deep fear.The sound effects also produce a feeling for the audience to feel the horror of atomic bomb. The stomping of those feet against the wooden floor couldn't escape my head until now.Lastly is the cinematography, every angle is taken perfectly, the practical effects are really pleasing to the eye. The approach to Murphy's face in the final scene literally describes Oppenheimer's entire life. The explosion was also really grandiose.Christopher Nolan literally describes it all perfectly, and I have absolutely no words to compliment this man. If you want to feel Christopher Nolan's way of seeing the world, watch this film. 3 hours passed without getting bored, like only an hour.That is all from me. Thank you."
"Oppenheimer has always been regarded by History as an interesting figure for the advancement of scientific discovery. While also being a rather controversial figure for his choices and mankind. Nolans Oppenheimer takes the audience on that dramatic epic of ethical proportions, in many ways, it is conflicting yet still fantasizing in every way Throughout the movie, you see the psyche and internal conflict, personal Matters left facing. The themes of the era with the red scare with McCarthyism, the paranoia and the shadow hanging over following Oppenheimer throughout. What the influence of such a weapon carries? The pressure put on a man. If the possibility of the enemy having such a thing, is it better to act before they do? Are the ones who claim to fight for you the ones to trust themselves? This is a movie about Mankind, not just the bomb being built, or the overall progress much of the war. Much like say The Imitation Game focusing on the war being fought behind the battle line. This is a very heavy dialogue-driven focus on the aspects of science and politics, and the psychological of Oppenheimer, but all of this things investing as you jump around these different time frames. Primary because of the great reforming given by like Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey who gives probably the second-best performance in this ensemble cast. With most of his films, the cinematography is done amazingly as well as the visuals that emphasize of fission and chain reactions of the panning landshot the use of and the lack of color, and of course the big payoff of the bomb and the impact of all, and the Explosions Performances that on the big screen can't be compared to watching it at home."
"In a world that's problematic you're perplexing, spending your time with particles, that are complexing, pushing boundaries to their limits, the fission/fusion of new physics, with the clashes, conflicts, contests you elicit. As a consequence you setup two big bangs, when you execute through governmental plans, although this story does not dwell, on the hell that you propel, to the people who are wiped out in Japan. In the end we're left to ponder motivations, of those who seek to play, with torments and damnations, of those who hide inside the shadows, pulling strings in Emperor's clothes, as they plot to raze the cornerstone foundations."
"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil."
"It's clear that Christopher Nolan is now so powerful that no one has the guts to tell him no.I remember how the filmmakers in the special features to The Godfather Part II (1974) discussed that it took a long time for them in editing to figure out how often they should switch between the different time periods. Clearly no one bothered to ponder this question in the editing of Oppenheimer. We jump backwards and forwards in time so frequently that no scene has time to breathe. And this in a movie that's three hours long! Which, incidentally, is one hour too long.Nolan falls into his regular trap of telling instead of showing.We're told by other characters that Oppenheimer's a genius. The evidence we've been shown to support this claim is him dropping a beaker in class and not much else. Compare this to A Beautiful Mind (2001) where they try to illustrate how the mind of that main character works. In Oppenheimer that's substituted with blurry macro photography.Two hours into the movie we are also told by one character that Oppenheimer is a womanizer. At this point he has been shown to have had two women. Again, show us, don't tell us.Filming the entire movie in IMAX was truly casting pearls before swine. The huge format added nothing (except production costs I imagine). It reminded me of The Hateful Eight (2015). I was so excited that Tarantino was going to shoot a Western on 65mm, a perfect format for glorious vistas. And then they were outside for like the first five minutes of the movie and spent the rest inside a little log cabin. The same holds true for Oppenheimer, which is 95% dialogue scenes in tight quarters making the IMAX format completely and utterly useless.As for the explosion of the bomb, which occurs around the two-hour mark, I have to say that it was quite underwhelming. Mad respect for Nolan's ambition to not use CG, but perhaps sometimes it's justified. The explosion in the opening of Apocalypse Now (1979) and at the end of Blown Away (1994) looked more impressive than the one in Oppenheimer, which is covered mostly in closeups anyway.As for the results of the bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, we are shown nothing. Some abstract numbers are discussed, and the only visual reference we get is of Oppenheimer's face watching a newsreel. For anyone interested in an account written only a year after the bombing I would recommend Hiroshima by John Hersey (available for free online in The New Yorker). Or better yet, visit the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum which is outstanding.Funnily enough, this movie is carefully toeing the line of decades long American propaganda where the bomb is presented as an alternative to invasion, which is claimed to have saved tens of thousands of American lives (by now the figure mentioned if often in the millions). I would urge anyone interested in this to read Hiroshima Nagasaki by Paul Ham which is an extensive study of the development of the nuclear bomb program. The bomb was never an alternative to invasion, it was a complement. And the Japanese leadership didn't even consider the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The reason they surrendered to the Americans was because the Soviet Union opened up a front against Japan which threatened not only their colonies in Manchuria and Korea, but also Hokkaido in Japan proper."
"0 out of 10 starsChristopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a bloated, overwrought, and ultimately unsatisfying film. The film is three hours long, but it feels even longer, thanks to Nolan's penchant for unnecessary scenes and characters. The supporting characters are all flat and one-dimensional, and they don't have enough time to develop.The sound and music are also too loud, overused, and noisy. Some of the illusory scenes are too glaring and disturbing. The film is also visually confusing, with Nolan's trademark use of shaky cameras and quick cuts.The only bright spot in the film is Matt Damon's performance as General Leslie Groves. Damon gives a nuanced and complex performance, but he's not enough to save the film.Overall, Oppenheimer is a mess. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film. Nolan is an overrated director, and he often tells a simple story in a complicated and overlong manner. And he does it again in this film.Additional Thoughts:I was also disappointed by the film's portrayal of the atomic bomb. The film doesn't really explore the moral implications of the bomb, and it doesn't really show the devastation that it caused.I also found the film's ending to be unsatisfying. The film ends with Oppenheimer having a breakdown, but it's not clear what he's learned from his experience.Overall, I would not recommend Oppenheimer to anyone. It's a long, confusing, and ultimately unsatisfying film."
"""Oppenheimer"" or ""How the Father of the Atomic Bomb learned to start worrying and Hate the Bomb""In this story of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer it's not just about his role in the development of the atomic bomb at Los Alamos, New Mexico, but also the machiavellian manoeuvres going on to discredit him in the United States.The downfall of Oppenheimer is the main thrust of this story arc, long after he helped his government build the A Bombs that landed on Hiroshima and Nagasaki killing thousands of innocent civilians to end World War 2 even though Adolph Hitler was already dead and the Germans had surrendered.""Oppenheimer"" is the most promising and prominent Oscar bait so far of 2023 for Best Picture, Screenplay, Sound Engineering, Actor, Supporting Actor etc.If this doesn't sweep the floor then I don't know what will.Cillian Murphy is outstanding, Robert Downey Jr. Unrecognisable at first and gives a very different performance.It's almost like he's channeling F. Murray Abraham (""Amadeus"") and ""My Left Foot"" star Daniel Day Lewis.In fact, the way this film plays out reminded me of the genius of ""Amadeus"".This is one of the most impressive uses of an all-star cast I've ever seen.More often than not the higher the star count the lesser the movie, but director Christopher Nolan (""Dark Knight"") manages to herd his cattle even better than Alfred Hitchcock.I'm talking about Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh, Gary Oldman, Emily Blunt, Josh Hartnett, Ben Affleck, Matthew Modine, Rami Malek & Aussie Jason Clarke to name a few.These actors transformed themselves for their roles superbly.The only actor noticeably absent from this ensemble was Michael Caine who's been in many Nolan movies.Somehow no CGI was harmed in the making of this movie...none at all, despite the awesome Visual SFX.It's not the first time Murphy & Nolan have worked, it's their sixth collaboration, but it is Cillians first time as the lead in one of Christopher's movies as the American theoretical physicist and Project Director of The Manhattan Project to create the first nuclear weapons of mass destruction.Plus I tips me hat to composer Ludwig Gorannson for his score, which takes this movie to another level.Special shout out also to cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema who worked with Nolan on ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk"" and ""Tenet"".""Oppenheimer"" is based on the biographical book ""American Prometheus"" and when Nolan saw the cover art on the book he could only see Murphy in this titular role.Warning: Nudity & Sex scenes (in a movie about scientist nerds...I know right!)
After sitting through 3 intense hours of what could have been dry fodder in the hands of lesser people (it's very wordy dialogue centric so please pay attention) I can understand why ""Oppenheimer"" was one of the most anticipated movies of the year.I saw this in The Lounge/Gold Class so I can't begin to imagine how mind blowing ""Oppenheimer"" will look and sound in its intended IMAX format and for the first time ever Kodak invented Black and White IMAX film just for this movie.This is possibly the best, most important movie ever given the rumblings of war mongering in the world today.As J. Robert Oppenheimer states in this movie, ""I don't know if we can be trusted with such a weapon. But I know the Nazis can't.""
This could possibly be Director Christopher Nolans Magnum Opus!"
"One of the most anticipated films of this year and who better to deliver the film none other than Christopher Nolan. Nolan makes the audience think, and I think for me at least it will click better with a second viewing much like DUNKIRK or TENENT. Nevertheless the shoulders of this film is carried by Cillian Murphy who finally gets to showcase his talents as a lead. He's always been a treat to watch on screen and I'm very happy for him. He deserves all the praise.Murphy channels Oppenheimer incredibly well. He acts with his eyes and his face. Throughout the film you're not in doubt with what he's thinking and what he's feeling as he never really expresses his feelings until the aftermath of his invention. Murphy effortlessly anchors the entire 3 hour film and it is a surefire Oscar nomination. He's consistently brilliant in almost anything he does and I think this film will put him on top of Everest.Robert Downey Jr. I think could potentially get an nomination as well. After an incredible decade of being Iron Man, he's able to show off his other talents reminiscent of his pre-Iron Man days. He disappears into the role of Lewis Strauss and he takes every opportunity to show Strauss's two-faced nature, patiently biding his time to strip Oppenheimer of his good reputation. To my surprise, Josh Harnett has a meaty role as Ernest Lawrence and it's nice to see him on screen again. Matt Damon brings his A-game as Major General Leslie Groves. He's a no-nonsense military character, but also rather an important figure who seizes the opportunity to use Oppenheimer's talents to his advantage. The unlikely alliance between the two is a treat to watch as Murphy and Damon have a good dynamic together.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh contribute to the story as his wife Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively. To me I saw these two as a reminder of Oppenheimer's character flaws as he was not perfect. They represented something significant in Oppenheimer's life, Kitty being who he should be with, but Jean being someone he wants to be with. Also being that this is a Nolan film, no part is a small part, so there are a lot of incredibly talented and well recognized actors playing other historic figures and people of importance, so it was kind of fun to see who pops up as who for their glorified, but layered and important cameos.In true Nolan fashion, this isn't a conventional biopic. It's told in non-sequential order highlighting specific points in Oppenheimer's life jumping from places to places. For some this is the make or break for the film. I do think one has to be an experienced viewer of film to keep up with the non-linear storytelling, but again Nolan is very resourceful with the way he does this so it never really feels like you're too lost. I will admit though I do think I would have preferred something a little bit more conventional for my tastes. I liked the flow more when there were moments to marinate things happening in chronological order as opposed to jumping around and to Nolan's credit, he does this near the last hour or so. This is where I also felt the film is at its best when it focused on the psychological thriller aspect. There's one sequence in involving a speech that's particularly terrifying as you can feel Oppenheimer's horror and remorse. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments leading up to the completion of the bomb and when they begin to test it, it is very gripping when you don't expect it to be.Production design is incredible, the attention to detail is also impeccable. Kudos to production designer Ruth De Jong who also has experience in period pieces like THERE WILL BE BLOOD. Creating a look and feel to a time that's long gone may seem so simple and easy to do on the surface, but I cannot imagine the challenges the crew had to face, making sure everything was on point to that era. From costumes, buildings, set design, cars, etc. You feel transported to that time. It's also shot in a way that is also very immersive by Hoyte Van Hoytema, making this his fourth collaboration with Nolan. Music is composed by Ludwig Göransson, who also killed it with BLACK PANTHER and MANDALORIAN. He is definitely going to get some praise for his work here.This film almost touches on greatness, if it were not for it's length and time jumps. The movie is overly dense as it tries to bundle too much of Oppenheimer's pre and post-Trinity life into one movie. I also do think if you're a history buff it will be a more enjoyable experience, but for those who aren't too familiar with the subject, it is something that might be harder to digest with its first viewing. I do personally think somewhere in this film, there is a phenomenal 2.5 hour cut, but OPPENHEIMER is still a powerful biopic that explores and shows the dark side of human nature, powered by a tour-de-force performance from Cillian Murphy. Another landmark achievement from Christopher Nolan.8/10."
"The cinematic genius Christopher Nolan is undoubtedly one of the finest stars in the film industry.

Hats off to the prodigious Christopher Nolan, who will remain a symbol of creativity and distinction in the world of cinema for thousands of years to come!.And all of this will apply to Oppenheimer film, which will reflect all of Christopher's art in this work."
"First off, the dialogues are actually audible, quite clear, happy that they mended this in comparison to Nolan's last outing Tenet.Secondly, a captivating story told in a even more captivating way.The acting is perhaps best of the year so far, Oscar nominations galore.I saw it on a digital IMAX screen, very pristine and filmy.Sound, cinematography and score are stand outs too.Only thing is, this film would have been a even better mini series.The run time and intense dialogues/ intrigues can be quite draining to the viewer.As a Dutchman I noticed that, Oppenheimer did not speak Dutch in the film, it sounded like an Irishman trying to speak German. Half a point deduction.Not Nolan's best but it is up there, like the bellowing smoke from a nuclear explosion.8.5/10Let's go to James Bond 007 next, Nolan!"
"Saw Oppenheimer today on an IMAX screen. I'm an emotional wreck but also buzzing with delight! Finally we get an intelligent, mature film for grown-ups, with scientific wonder, espionage intrigue & political drama all In one. Superb ensemble acting & production. Nolan's pinnacle.One reviewer said they found it a bit too conversation heavy, but for me that's no problem. All The President's Men, The Conversation and JFK are all 'talk-heavy' and I loved those too.I appreciate why many folks found Inception, Tenet & Interstellar a bit hard to follow, but I don't think this is as much of a head scratcher. Yes we jump back & forth across a few time periods in Oppenheimer's life, but once we've seen them all (only 4 or 5), it's fine.I sat in the front row of the IMAX cinema so I could feel like I was absorbed into the film. The sound design is bloody amazing and during a few moments it thumped through my body, it felt wonderful! Superb music score by Ludwig Göransson too.If there's any justice in the acting awards season, whenever they start, Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr deserve a stack of nominations, two particularly outstanding performances in a film crammed full of impressive acting displays. I was also absolutely delighted to see Tom Conti back on the big screen, this time as Albert Einstein. A superb actor who I've admired for decades. I'd avoid any reviews if you want surprises on which actors turn up, that weren't featured in the trailer. A couple of unexpected cameos were lovely to see!Overall a 10/10 production, bloody loved it, going back for a 2nd viewing on IMAX after my next payday!"
Speechless this movie had a very good sound design good visual that will blow your Mind and you will getting the best score in this movie and one thing you all saying this is boring? God help this movie had very good plot and story by freackin Christopher Nolan without even one Freackin CGI and yall still saying this is boring pillow and a blanket yall don't know the plot is and not focus to the story this is top 3 best Christopher Nolan MOVIE i have ever SEEEN and i think for 3 hours movie is too short for this movie i want 4 hoursss and anyway what a good plot twist in the end the acting is badaass good and the rdj deserves an Oscar for this film.
"I can't help but wonder what this movie would've looked like if it had been directed by a different filmmaker, and I believe that it probably would've been better. Like most Nolan films this lacks emotion. Oppenheimer was a stoic man for sure but he had moments of catharsis throughout his life. Having read the book this film is based on (American Prometheus) I noticed that many of the relationships that affected his (Oppie's) life and career, and his hypnotic charisma were sadly missing in this film. The whole idea of the book, more over the whole point of Oppie's infamous testimony, was to explain the actions by shedding light on the man. I'm disappointed to say that this is no tale of the man, rather a tale of the Los Alamos project and a couple of testimonies. The film may have been packed with beautiful imagery, riveting score and decent performances, but it's painfully obvious that it lacks heart.The length is another issue. There seems to be a trend in Hollywood to tell simple and short stories over an extremely extensive period, and to tell longer and more complicated stories over a short period. This falls into the latter category. Nothing is flushed out. We jump from scene to scene with no context. Other than Oppie every character felt insignificant, including his wife and his adversary, both played by brilliant actors who are shamefully wasted here. This film could've greatly benefited from a longer runtime. It is hard not to compare this with 2014's Imitation Game and 2010's Social Network, which did a lot more character work and did good jobs at portraying emotions.Having said all that I did very much enjoy this film. Certain visual and sound effects were used to perfection, complementing the theme in a truly awesome way. Although being a massive Nolan fan and and having read the book (which helps in putting scattered scenes into context) I'm sure this is somewhat biased.If this had been made by another filmmaker I would've given it a 7.Had I not read the book I would've given it a 6.But alas I give it an 8!"
"This intercuts the development of the atomic bomb(which is where the simmering tension arises from, not the Nolan staple of ill intentioned guys with guns. It is absolutely true that this is mostly made up of guys talking without anything dramatic happening at the same time, no heists, interrogations, death-defying behavior, and it is gripping from start to finish), the hearing to determine if Oppenheimer would keep his security clearance(which smoothly enables this to work in any incident that was deemed vital to the story of him), and the hearing to determine if Lewis Strauss joins the government(which does a solid job of contrasting the two men and their values).The three hours really flew by, honestly it felt like it was half the length. It really underlines how Robert felt about the nuke, and how those feelings changed significantly over time. The massive guilt he felt after Hiroshima and Nagasaki seems like the kind of thing that you couldn't possibly properly communicate. This makes it inescapable. Not everyone will respond well to how it renders visual what people are thinking, personally I thought it worked incredibly well. This does require some knowledge of World War 2 and the Red Scare. You don't need to already know how fission and the like work. That is explained well herein.I really appreciate how relevant this is. It is in part exploring escalation in war(today we're seeing it with drones - the line ""the weapons we have, we tend to end up using"" is chilling) and manipulation in politics(a huge problem right now, one of the main reasons that we are struggling to solve potentially world ending problems like climate change, despite how much we can do technologically). Some have taken issue with how it deals with Communism. It doesn't make the Soviet Union seem even remotely appealing, on the contrary, it just acknowledges the appeal of socialism, as well as the intense government pressure against it at the time. I've seen some call the sex scene awkward, when in reality it's meant to be. The reason that it's handled the way that it is is to underline how scrutinized the titular character became, and criticize that.I recommend this to everyone that believes they can handle the subject matter. 10/10."
"I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film. Let's first talk about what worked: ""Oppenheimer"" is no doubt a treat for the ears and eyes. I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors. I also don't think I need to say anything further about Nolan as a filmmaker; he's like Martin Scorsese in the way you know exactly what you're going to get from a Nolan film, in terms of style and tone.Now onto the problems: Nolan's films tend to be very dialogue-heavy, and this film was no different. Having not done any earlier research on Oppenheimer's life purposefully, so I can go into the film with a blank slate and let Nolan do the work for me, I felt disappointed that I had to look up people's names and backstories during the movie. Nolan throws you right into the plot without a whole lot of exposition or background of each real historical figure portrayed. Normally I don't like a lot of exposition, but for a 3-hour long film, it would be great if we could fill in the blanks for some of the real-life figures' motivations and aspirations, to get a better feel on why they either supported or denied helping Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project.My other major gripe was the absence of any real emotional arch. The film is somewhat of a straightforward retelling of events, no better than watching a three-hour documentary about Oppenheimer's work on the Manhattan Project, but without extensive exposition as mentioned earlier. Yes, it's edited in a non-linear fashion, but if one were to re-edit the film chronologically, you'd get a straightforward and somewhat dry narrative. One of the goals of a filmmaker is to help you empathize with the characters, especially the protagonist. Although Nolan perhaps wanted us to feel ambivalent about Oppenheimer's ambiguous morality, it still would have been nice to get a little bit of a better perspective as to why Oppenheimer decided to move forward with the Manhattan Project beyond the obvious reason of wanting recognition as a premiere theoretical physicist.This is also true for moments in the film that I wish were included that would have left more of a lasting impact on the audience if added in. The actual dropping of both bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not included, merely mentioned over a radio broadcast. So in my opinion the emotional weight of the dropping of those two bombs, and witnessing the sheer horror of their impact is totally lost on the audience beyond Oppenheimer's waking nightmares that he has throughout the film. For films of this stature, sometimes I imagine scenic moments in my head before watching the film, which can taint the experience if you have these types of high expectations for potentially emotionally impactful scenes. I tried not to let it dampen my experience, but once I realized these moments were not included in the film, I felt that there was much more left to the imagination.Lastly, the sound design was much better than ""Interstellar"" or Nolan's previous films where the score overpowers the dialogue. I could hear the dialogue in ""Oppenheimer"" for most of the film, but there were still a handful of times when I couldn't hear people speaking over the orchestral score. That's not to say it holds the film back in any substantive way, I just wanted to mention it still seems to be a minor issue in Nolan's filmography.This film will no doubt be regarded as a classic, and in the Nolan pantheon, it will most likely rank amongst ""The Prestige"", ""The Dark Knight"", ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"", as some of Nolan's greatest works. But I can't help but feel like Nolan is also a bit on autopilot, in terms of his filmmaker prowess. Much like P. T. Anderson with ""Licorice Pizza"", and Wes Anderson for ""Astroid City"", these powerful filmmakers have found their sweet spot and are sticking to it. Nolan I feel is leaning into his strengths as well with ""Oppenheimer"", but in my opinion, is no longer challenging himself as a filmmaker. This is not necessarily a bad thing; he is one of our best living directors. But as a fan of Steven Spielberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch, and Ridley Scott who are versatile directors that can tackle different genres and tones, I feel Nolan will stick to his guns (and, well, explosions), and keep giving us intelligent character studies, that unfortunately occasionally lack in catharsis or heightened emotional depth."
"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due. A 10 used to meant perfection, not just the glare or the sparkles. Remember not all that shines is gold."
"Although the time passed quickly, ultimately, Oppenheimer has left me disappointed. The problem with this film is that it can't decide which story it tries to tell - building the bomb or the inquiry of the national security committee. Both of those stories are depicted well, Nolan uses nice narrative devices to locate the characters in their currently depicted temporal location, etc. However, the cheap moral that the film concludes with has been beaten to death and because of that it undermines everything the script tried to achieve. The film didn't leave me speechless and a rather poorly executed sequence of the denotation doesn't really justify the historic development of a black and white IMAX film stock."
"Christopher Nolan just stamped his foot print into cinema history as an all time great. It is as if each film he's made has just been a building block leading him to conduct this masterpiece. Oppenheimer is Nolan's finest work. Murphy delivers a sublime performance, reaching a threshold very few actors ever will. Next year's Oscar statue can be put into escrow for Cillian. Nolans three hour plutonium dense genius-of-physics, magnum opus does for the atomic bomb what Spielberg did for sharks at the beach. It seems Christopher Nolan has turned in a tour de force that has vaporized the competition. In fact, Scorsese's 'flowers of the killer moon' may be the only threat of a rival for best picture. However, that may be the toughest act to follow since Einstein's theory of relativity."
"Christopher Nolan is a savant of filmmaking. Cillian Murphy SHINES in this movie. They are one absolutely amazing duo. Not to mention a strong supporting cast around them and.""Oppenheimer"" is jam packed with information and begging to be watched 2, 3, 4 times. I walked out of the theater ready to watch it again already. It is fascinating and engages you the entire time you're watching.All of the performances by everyone involved bring the story to life to its fullest potential. They showed up and absolutely showed out on screen for this historical retelling: honestly a masterpiece. 1000% worth watching in theaters if you can."
"Filmmaker Paul Schreder has called ""Oppenheimer"" the ""best, most important film of this century"". Hyperbole aside, we're only twenty-two plus years into the century, and not many of us will be around to confirm his hypothesis. So best? Well, that's very subjective. Important though, he might be onto something. Important in the way the latter part of the picture emphasizes Robert J. Oppenheimer's (Cillian Murphy) personal angst in leading a team that developed the capability of destroying the entire world and all of mankind. That could have occurred on July 16, 1945 with the testing of the first atomic bomb at Los Alamos, even Oppenheimer wasn't fully convinced of Edward Teller's (Benny Safdie) 'near zero' proclamation that all would be well.I must confess, I don't know a whole lot about the development of the A-Bomb, but the movie has steered me in the direction of learning more. What I didn't expect in the latter third of the film was how the railroad job the Gray Board, influenced by Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.), tried to demonize Oppenheimer for his early Communist sympathies, while questioning his loyalty to the United States. With eighteen years gone by and Oppenheimer's loyalty capably demonstrated, his treatment at the board smacked of personal animus for which Strauss eventually paid a price with his failure to be approved for a Cabinet position. That little tidbit about a future President casting a negative vote was a great bit of trivia I'll be anxious to research.Questions of best or most important movie aside, I think this is a valuable film for anyone to view keeping a historical perspective and how it translates to the modern era. With the threat of nuclear annihilation ever present, it's important for cooler heads to prevail on the world stage to prevent the kind of catastrophe that would emerge from the quixotic impulse of some madman. See the film."
"Nolan's best film will be in the biographical style. I hope he can do something like Nolan's Inception that will be remembered decades from now, because he himself said that great physicists were used for this film to work with precision and seriousness.Particle for direct object
CGI special effects are not used in this movie. It can be said that this excites people. Anyway, this year's movie is going to be better, no doubt about it and I'm really looking forward to it.It would be great if it became the best film of this year and the best director nominee.Nolan's amazing love You so much ."
"Waited three hours for an explosion and it was probably the most disappointing part of the film.Otherwise, a great movie with a great cast that will be talked about for decades.So glad that I am alive to watch Christopher Nolan in his prime still and glad that I am living in the return of cinema.Easily up there with the best film of the year, will definitely be winning an Oscar.(This is here to fill the required characters, This is here to fill the required characters, This is here to fill the required characters, This is here to fill the required characters, This is here to fill the required characters)"
"From the top tier cast to the cinematography this movie is a masterpiece. The source of historical events of Los Alamos, project Manhattan is recreated in fantastic detail. What I like the most is the fact it's no CGI. Absolute Boss production here with the IMAX camera x special effects. You don't wanna miss out on that movie. Color range with black & white expresses the objective perception and colorful the subjective perspective from Oppenheimer. I'm convinced that I probably missed even more hidden details.Cilian Murphy deserve this spot where he is right now. He's one of the best actors in the world. His best work ever. I can't single out every other actors work here the list wouldn't stop.The score of the movie was produced by Ludwig Göransson. He did an amazing job as usual in his previous work.There come scenes when you spot an actor you were not aware of being here and that's so awesome the way this movie mastered the difficulty of not wasting an actors skill set.Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors of all time. His way of making movies is unique."
"This was one of my most anticipated films of the last few years and unbelievably it did not disappoint in any way.After the lacklustre, confusing and very hollow experience of TENET, I thought Nolan had lost his way a bit. I assumed that, despite knowing that Nolan is one of the greatest filmmakers to have ever lived, I was very wary of Oppenheimer and thought it would not be as good as I hoped it to be.How wrong I was. Oppenheimer is a masterpiece, Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus. It is an astounding work of complexity, uniqueness and originality the likes of which I have never seen before. Nolan has outdone himself - it feels like every piece of work Nolan has done in the past has been leading to this film. The non-linear narrative, the visual/special effects, the character building, the story structure, all of it comes together seamlessly to create a truly awe inspiring experience.Cillian Murphy gives the best performance of his career and one of the finest of the last few years. Every time he is on screen he is captivating, alluring and haunting. The film is properly titled - it is not a story about the bomb, it is a story about how it's creation impacted Oppenheimer and Cillian completely embodies the role. His eyes - his eyes and the look on his face allow you to view this man as a tortured soul, a man who knows he did his duty and did it for the right reasons but who ultimately regrets his life due to the legacy he will leave behind.Oppenheimer is outstanding in every regard - amazing music, beautiful cinematography, gorgeous visuals, a brilliant cast, a sharp and smart script. Oppenheimer is definitely, so far in my opinion, the best film of 2023."
"This movie is not for people who watch the phone every 5 minutes, can't concentrate more time than a TiK Tok video or not trained into watching magnificent details.I grew up watching real movies, and I am able to disconnect from the world for 2-3 hours, and consequently enjoy a great movie like Openheimer. Are you?First, all the cast makes an acting masterclass. Cillian and Robert are incredible. Real, gritty and scary portrait of human being.Second, cinematography, music, storytelling and scenarios are simply amazing. Details counts, and here you need to watch carefully everything to understand the movie as a whole great masterpiece.Last, camera work, direction and script are superb. I was inmerse in a great trip from beginning till the end. Nolan's best movie since Batman ones.To add, I can't remember last time a movie fulfilled me as Openheimer. So, overall a masterpiece to enjoy if you love real cinema."
"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia."
"Oppenheimer's marketing campaign hammered two messages into our heads. First, that we had to watch it in the biggest screen possible. And second, that audiences had come out of test projections deeply affected or in tears. Having watched the film, I can confidently say none of those promises are true.For a Christopher Nolan film, Oppenheimer is very unspectacular, with only a handful of atomic explosion images, which -unfortunately- are not new and will not impact anyone in the audience. And it's also quite unemotional. You leave the theatre feeling like you just went through a (rather long) history lesson, but not particularly devastated. Because the film chooses -as is often the case with Nolan- a clinical approach to its subject, and the contradictions and dilemmas of Oppenheimer are observed the way one observes an insect, instead of a human character. It looks as if Nolan were trying to compete in intelligence with the scientists in his film. This is Nolan's consistent flaw. He is so insecure that he is only happy when he has proven to everyone how intelligent he is. To do this, in addition to the ice cold way in which he treats his characters, he throws into Oppenheimer his signature mixing of time periods, always afraid people will see him as mediocre if he ever just followed the chronological order of events. And in this case, he adds black and white to one of the time periods of the movie, which makes the whole thing a little cheesy.But as always too, Nolan shows control of the medium, and delivers some strong moments with virtuoso camera movements, broad shots and a great score. Most enjoyable in the film is the performance of its extraordinary cast. Every last one of them is outstanding, starting with Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer.The balance is a bit of an average film, undeniably very long and a bit boring, despite the talent of the filmmaker and the cast."
"""They won't fear it until they understand it. And they won't understand it until they've used it. Theory will take you only so far."" J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy)The ""it"" is the atomic bomb, for which Oppenheimer was called ""The Father."" Writer/director Christopher Nolan has adapted the authoritative 2005 bio ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Nolan, surveying Oppenheimer's life and especially his leadership of The Manhattan Project, has crafted a harrowing story deeply embedded in our history as Oppenheimer developed the two atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki that helped end WWII.Yet, this film is not really about the making of the bombs-it is rather about the turmoil surrounding Oppenheimer with such weighty questions about killing tens of thousands of civilians with the bombs, whether that would force Japan to surrender, and whether or not he was a Communist.Nolan keeps it favorable to history only now and then emphasizing interactions that cannot be verified such as conversations with his wife, the alcoholic Kitty (Emily Blunt), and his mistress, Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). Murphy underplays masterfully Oppenheimer's struggles while he carefully considers each challenge, like the scientist he plays. Just as upending are the anti -Communist attacks that dogged him through his professional life.Along with cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, Nolan captures the vast loneliness of the new Mexico desert using 65 mm film projected in 70mm. As in Dunkirk (2017), Nolan uses the process to mirror the magnitude of the subject and the intellectual excitement following Einstein's 1915 publishing of his theory of general relativity-it's the chalkboards that announce mankind's precipitate changes and provide the intellectual excitement eclipsing even that of the bomb itself.Nolan's mixing black and white and then color helps to relieve the monotony for some of the film's three hours but mostly shows the upheaval of his life, especially the last third in black and white, where the antisemitic Red Scare threatened his legacy as scientist and humanitarian.His turn as critic of nuclear war toward the end of his life was not without attendant compromise of his achievements. Perhaps his thoughts as he saw the first test mushroom cloud said it all about how his research for the bomb changed him and the world:""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."" ""Oppenheimer"" is the best movie of the year so far and one of the great war movies of all time."
"I am a fan of Christopher Nolan's work, and this one lived up to his best standards. Covering almost forty years, from Oppenheimer as a student in England and Germany, to the unsatisfying honors of his later years, Nolan, cast and crew, have labored to create a portrait of a man , full of flaws, but smarter than I can imagine, and placed him among other men of similar brilliance in a way that illuminates them all. And like watching Penn & Teller do the cup-and-ball trick, I see exactly what he does and still can't catch him doing it, any more than I recognized Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss, who turns into the villain of the piece.It's early to start predicting Oscar nominations, and Nolan's pictures have been slighted in the past. However, one nomination I feel confident about is that Luisa Abel will be nominated for make-up, as she ages her characters through their lifetimes.Nolan's movies encompass big themes and often distorted views of time. This would seem to render them too highbrow for popularity yet they are popular. They challenge the audience without insulting him. They don't indulge in bafflegab to offer a fig leaf to their nonsense, but explain things in terms he can understand (I omit TENET from this discussion), just as the scientists use language they can understand. Nolan as a film maker is the type of craftsman I try to be as a writer: engaging, entertaining, making his points without talking down, and leaving the audience a little happier and more knowledgeable than when he started. My only dissatisfaction with this movie is that he is so much better at his craft than I at mine."
"I went in with very high expectations and somehow left being more blown away than I thought possible .First of all - the writing. So well scripted- the dialogue , pacing and format all played hand in hand to create an engaging and thoughtful presentation of an incredible story in a way that let you discover Nolan's impressions of the story even if you already knew about the history . The moralistic dilema and presentation leaves room to make your own conclusions , draw your own opinions while reminding us both good and evil come in all forms .The black and white filming was very well integrated and it was such a cool way to move back and forth between timelines - ultimately colliding near the end . I loved that the black and white was the current whereas the past was color . The past in color was the story as history is written , as people remember , what memory tells us as individuals. The present in black and white is a search for truth - when they collide it's a reminder as color infiltrates the present that ultimate truth can never be known .The acting for characters was astounding - you did not truly like any of them - another salute to the presentation of the premise of this movie - no clear answers . Salute to Pugh and Blunt who were absolutely astounding in the roles they played .Another huge element to this movie which deserves praise and accolades is the incredible sound production and editing . The scene where the test takes place is especially well done in this respect . The glimpses into Oppenheimers mind were also audibly very powerful and showed a broken and conflicted soul ling before the creation of the bomb .I could go on and on - but this is what film should be . Help us reflect on humanity , on ourselves and remind us that film is one of the most powerful mediums on earth ."
"Christopher Nolan has truly outdone himself with this gripping biographical drama. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer was nothing short of extraordinary; he brought an incredible depth and complexity to the character, making the genius physicist feel hauntingly real.Nolan's direction was masterful as always, seamlessly blending history, science, and emotion. The visuals were breathtaking, transporting us back to the era of the Manhattan Project with stunning attention to detail. The use of practical effects and practical sets added a sense of authenticity that further immersed me in the story.One aspect that stood out was the film's exploration of Oppenheimer's moral dilemmas and the weight of the decisions he faced. The screenplay didn't shy away from the ethical implications of his work on the atomic bomb, forcing the audience to confront the morally gray areas of scientific progress during wartime.What impressed me the most was Nolan's ability to present complex scientific concepts in an accessible way without oversimplifying them. The film catered to both science enthusiasts and general audiences, striking a perfect balance between intellectual stimulation and emotional resonance.While Oppenheimer may not be an action-packed thriller like some of Nolan's previous works, its slow and deliberate pacing allowed for a profound and thought-provoking experience. By the final act, I found myself questioning the moral implications of scientific advancements and reflecting on the consequences of our choices as a species."
"Christopher Nolan, once again, uses astonishing film techniques to embark the audience on an other worldly adventure. He brings to light the historical significance of the Manhattan project and Los Alamos through the scientific and political background of such a unique town portrayed with perfection by such actors as Cillian Murphy and Matt Damon. By using Los Alamos and New Mexico as a film location for the film, Nolan is able to portray what life would have been for Oppenheimer and other scientists with their families around the time of the Trinity test.As someone who grew up in Los Alamos, I could arguably say that Oppenheimer correctly highlights the history of the town and the creation of the atomic bomb alongside Nolan's own creative input to emphasise Oppenheimer's story.Cillian Murphy delivers such a vast and emotionally compelling role by highlighting the moral dilemma Oppenheimer himself faced and on that we deal with in todays age.For being a 3 hr plus film the pacing is incredible and an average movie goer can endure such horror, mystery, and drama all in one storyline that fills holes at the end created in the beginning."
"LIKES:The Presentation:
-Oppenheimer had a lot happen in his life, and this movie does its best to capture it without being too historical
-Nolan takes the underlying a story, a case, and uses it as a guiding line that helps tie together to the big parts and summarize his life. It works, and presents the evidence in this visual style and storytelling that works.-There is some Hollywood mixing that might stretch the truth, but it's balanced enough that I can't say it was annoying in conveying the struggles of this time period.-The result is a historical biography that moves, very important for a three hour period, and found myself engaged to listen to the tales of the father of quantum physics in America.The Acting:
-No surprise, this is going to be a contender for best acting, and rightfully so given the performances presented in this movie.-Every single person, big or small, has this atmosphere that works. It blends Hollywood dramatic theater with biography and conveys relationships, tensions, and dynamics that are closer to the pulse of reality than some other dynamics.-The tension of the case is conveyed in everyone, and I loved this buildup of so many sides on this issue and it worked well.-Damon is great, his range of acting continues to impress me and the way he has such control over character nuances. This pushed him to several different levels and found his engagement and evolution, quite awesome.-Blunt started out okay for me, one of my top actresses feeling a little sidelined and conveying an okay character. The later acts show her style though and I loved watching this woman deliver these lines and emotions with such a top notch level of acting that spices up acts 3 and 4.-Murphy is the one to keep eyes on though. The man's complexity has evolved way past Red Eye, his conveyance of mannerisms, quirks, obsessions, and genius creepy and yet entrapping. He plays well with everyone, hits these roles of a changing career on high cylinders, and makes a historical character intriguing to look more into.-All in all, this is probably one of the stronger qualities of the film, but there is more to dive into.The Visuals/Cinematography:
-Nolan is all about telling stories on a lot of levels, and visual sensations are a key component.-Oppenheimer has fantastic camera work, using angles, lighting, technology, and planning to find the optimum angle to give you the best of the situation.-The changing of filters for various parts adds this nuance that gives subtle changes, adding emotion and messages the likes I did not expect, while keeping me awake.-And the fact that it actively adapts to the character with hyper focus and realism, while still adding touches of grainy visuals of the times, is homage paid well.The Sound:
-Thank the Lord, this movie got the sound right and proved editing can still be done.-Nolan's team gives crisp dialog, easy to understand and listen, without getting drowned out by other sounds.-It's the Imax worthy piece of it, the musical scores adding that emotion going to do well on top notch speakers, while the resounding booms and other effects get an added life.-Another level of immersion, the movie really used the budget well to make sure you get all the information you need to follow, and perhaps cast your own vote before the end.The Story Pieces Chosen:
-For the most part, Oppenheimer's legacy is tied to the infamous device he crafted, but does that make the most interesting character for all?-Nolan seems to agree it doesn't, and like a good autobiography, finds snippets of his life to ingrain and add a bit more of the ""good stuff"" to enhance the character.-Facets of his life come into play at times, adding extra tests and impasses for him to work around while coordinating so much.-Friendships, relationships, and philosophies conveyed to some extent (though accurately I have no idea) that gives you more than just the science laden man you might think.-It works well for me and should help broaden the audience who will see that movie.-And to have details in all these components, both invention and non-invention, are finding a balance that is surprisingly well, though not as perfect as some might say.The Message:
-Outside of Batman, Nolan's work is often very much ingrained in symbolism, morals, and some assessments of characters that works.-And Oppenheimer is loaded with that. A fantastic movie that tests the fortitude of the human emotion and make us question how much we should push the boundaries.-While a tad heavy at times with some lines, the movie is beautifully done to really show the horrors of progress and the good and bads that we must sometimes weigh.-It adds extra edge to the movie, and again gives you that amazing investment for your time, which again works super well with everything.DISLIKES:More Character Balance:
-The movie has A LOT of names tied to it, and I won't lie that they aren't all in the movie to the same degree, so don't be surprised if your favorite is on and off in less than 30 minutes.-I mentioned Blunt before, but that evens out, but others, you have to be ready to hold tight to the moments they are in, and dive into books more with their engagement.-I would have liked more balance, integration, conveyance, and a few more moments that I wanted to see were absent. Inclusion would have bloated this film more, but a part of me would have loved more time with several characters.The Presentation Is Odd At First:
-Walking into the movie I asked if I had missed something.-The opening is very interesting and you have to be ready for that growth pain of the unique presentation, as you quickly go through his early life during this opening case.-About 20 minutes in, the movie evens out and I was able to understand the presentation style and where we were at. So if you can wade through the confusion at the start, you'll be fine.The Run Time:
-It's 3 hours and at times it feels like it when you hit the transition moments that are odd, which slow down the pace.-While most of the stuff is then fine, the last twenty to thirty minutes are the slow parts of the movie and felt the longest. It's important, but... it just feels bloated, long, and very drawn out, that I was ready to go.-True it was hour 5 of a movie, but there were other facets more detail would be welcomed for me, like projects and bombs, instead of seeing this complex endgame. But... it's symbolic and fitting to the story so that helps blunt the time dilation the final effects have.The Audience Entertainment?-Perhaps the last thing to bring to the audience is that this movie requires you to pay attention.-For those looking for entertainment and getting away, without the realism and politics of the world, this movie can be tough to engage with.-The flashbacks and paying attention, keeping track of the names, it's a lot and this might just get in the way of the enjoyment aspect for some, especially when paired with the run time.-Thus, the movie is good and truly an artistic wonder that sticks out from others, but a general audience may be bored and dock scores if they don't know what they are getting.The VERDICT:
Oppenheimer may be one of the most artistic and impressive movies of the year if not in a long time. Nolan proves once again that there is a medium of art and entertainment, and I was very engaged for much of this historical drama thanks to his directorial guidance. Fantastic acting with a stunning visual and audio collection bring history to life, and getting us engaged in a turning point of human culture. It's a summary of a tremendous man's life, and though it has some areas I want more of, did a nice job covering bases, with a little Hollywood spectacle added. True, it's a marathon and it isn't easy to hit if you are coming off a long day, one of the worst parts about it, but the pace and content are engaging to keep track of if you are looking for a deeper biographical film. Some character balance and pacing could be a tad smoothed out and cut down sure (maybe a director's cut), and it might not be the entertaining escape, but the movie really is worth the merit and praise for me given what it achieves in this genre. Teaching those lessons, with an engaging cast of characters, at a pace and timing that feels mostly complete without too much bloated feeling. Thus, my scores are:Biography/Drama/History: 9.5
Movie Overall: 9.0, maybe an 8.5 at the least."
"Rating: 9.6
Overall, a modern masterpiece that transcends the biopic as Nolan delivers a masterclass in direction, writing, and acting (with Cillian Murphy delivering a career-defining performance) as the movie is breathtaking from top to bottom with how it uses many different elements to help share its true message about the horrors of one's creation (and the implication it may have on the future).Brilliant Direction (The most mature storytelling Nolan has ever displayed as he weaves and controls all the scenes on both a macro and micro-scale to drive the story forward to show his message; this was the Nolan has ever done in getting the most out of his actors as the acting down the cast is amazing to where there are so many actors that have their best performance with this movie; has a more palatable interpretation of his signature Nolan style as he makes the audience think but in a way that they can understand (even if another viewing is needed to provide more clarity)), Incredible Acting (Incredible to Brilliant from Cillian Murphy (A career-defining performance as he truly embodies the role of Oppenheimer and is the real lightning rod for other actors to work off of as his presence really drives the performance of others and moves the story forward), Great to Incredible from Emily Blunt (Plays her role very well as she portrays the trauma and troubled relationship she has with her husband very well, showing the weight of him being passed onto her as the movie goes on), Great from Matt Damon (Plays his role very well and works off of Cillian to help drive the development of the Manhattan Project forward, really acts as the moral bridge between the government and the scientists), Great to Incredible from Robert Downey Jr. (Plays a very multi-dimensional role very well as his polished performance shows the cunning nature politicians can have as they try to be two-faced), Great from Florence Pugh (Does a Great job with the short time she is given as her chemistry with Murphy shows the effort Jean's relationship had on Oppenheimer), Great from Josh Hartnett (My favorite performance out of the secondary cast as his charm really brings personality into the movie that is filled with monotonous scientists), Very Good from Casey Affleck (Given very little screentime but does a very good job in building tension between Murphy in his scenes), Very Good from Rami Malek (A key performance in the movie as he does so much with very little given as he really comes to play in the final moments of the movie), Very Good from Kenneth Branagh (Uses a lot of his experience to play this role as he does well in playing the Dane that has an impact on Oppenheimer's career), Good from Benny Safdie (Kinda the most inexperienced performance of the whole movie but he does a good job in holding his own and building a conflicting relationship with Oppenheimer), Very Good from Jason Clarke (Plays one of the true antagonists of the movie very well as he is a driving presence in the security hearings), Good to Very Good from David Krumholtz (The comedic presence of the movie as he does try to make jokes throughout the movie (the only issue is that the movie is moving so fast there is no time to let the jokes stay and marinate with the audience)), Very Good to Great from Tom Conti (Embodies Albert Einstein very well and it feels like he was perfectly cast as his chemistry with Murphy and his delivery helps show the relationship Oppenheimer had with Einstein), Very Good from Alden Ehrenreich (A surprisingly very good performance from a Nolan composite character as his performance is the real moral lense the audience has to look into the whole situation), Very Good from the rest of the cast (This is an understatement with how good the cast was there is no one bad performance in the entire cast, which is incredible given how deep it is)), Incredible Story (An incredibly dense story that crams many moments in Oppenheimer's life into the film, but uses pace and runtime to make it seem like it may be too short at points as all the story points connect and drive the narrative forward; it is also great to see that they not only spend a lot of time on the Manhattan Project but the aftermath too as that is where the real message of the movie lies; The non-linear storytelling was an homage to Nolan's first break Memento as it helps with showing the consequences of the Manhattan Project), Brilliant Screenplay (One of the best screenplays I have ever witnessed in that the dialogue is so natural yet profound as actors can converse with each other with ease and it is embedded with symbols meant to tell the story; the symbolism is incredibly profound and some of the best I have ever seen in a movie as there are many symbols throughout the movie to help show the message it is trying to present; one of the best uses of foreshadowing I have ever seen as a second watch shows how hesitant the scientists were in creating the bomb given the implications it may have on humanity), Incredible Score (Incredibly complements the movie well and is used very well to build emotion and create pace and tension throughout), Incredible to Brilliant Cinematography (The mix of IMAX cameras with large format 70 MM cameras shows the grandeur of the operation and how larger than life the project was (as well as the aftermath); the mix of color and black-and-white help show different perspective and lenses throughout the movie), Great Sound (The sound editing was incredible as the sounds they used to create the explosions (and the lack of sounds at some point) help build tensions throughout the movie; the mixing of dialogue was an improvement from the previous Nolan movies but it still is an issue as there are some moments were the dialog is hard to hear), Incredible Editing (The cuts were incredibly fluid and some of the best work I have ever seen as they were so mesmerizing the watch on the big screen), Incredible to Brilliant Visual Effects (Some of the best effects work I have ever seen as the use of practical effects over CGI show the capabilities filmmakers have without the use of expensive technology), Great Production Design (This is specifically for Los Alamos as they did a great job in building a makeshift town), Very Good Costumes (The costume work for Oppenheimer is iconic and will be a big part of pop culture for years to come), Plot Structure was very unique and non-linear as Nolan takes a page out of Memento to use a non-linear structure to tell the narrative (and I am a big fan of this as it helps show the effects the Manhattan project has on the future and implications it has on the scientific and American community), Pacing was incredibly fast as the movie flies by its long runtime to fit in as much story as it can (this is neither really a positive nor a negative as there is nothing that could be cut from the movie), Climax was incredible as the movie really culminates to this moment (and this is done very well given how the movie jumps between time periods to help the audience holistically know the bigger picture), Tone was a culmination of a war bio-pic/courtroom-drama/grand epic as Nolan uses his signature style to take the best elements of all three to help establish a very unique tone, Saw in IMAX 70 MM and it really is an experience in itself."
"Greetings from Lithuania.If one thing i could be grateful to ""Oppenheimer"" (2023) is that it reminded me of ""Amadeus"" (1984). The rivalry between Salieri & Mozart, or to be more precise, Salieri's hate towards Mozart and the fact that he wasn't the genius motivated his revenge and hate, and that is presisely what happens in ""Oppenheimer"" - and i will leave it at that.On the other hand, Christopher Nolans new magnum opus ""Oppenheimer"" was master class movie on its own. While the story itself is a true one, unfortunately it did not captured my attention very much because I'm living on the other part of the world and some events that happens in third act of the film didn't really left me interested in them. What did kept me involved was brilliant filmmaking by Mr. Nolan. ""Oppenheimer"" is a real cinema for movie lovers - not especially a Friday night movie theater crowd - this was not a crowd-pleaser by any means. With cast as amazing as in here, i was been glued to me screen because of amazing performers, amazing directing, music, sound effects and cinematography. Script was great and more unique then i could imagine. And i have no doubts that Robert Downey Jr. Will get his Oscar nomination for this film - he stole every scene he was in - this is his take on Salieri.And Cillian Murphy was as good as he ever was.Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" felt like a unique movie theater experience, because i will probably never going to see film like this on a big screen soon again. Its ""artsy"", not a mainstream Friday night film and because of that it will leave many scratching their heads. But for those willing to take a chance, this is a biopic like no other."
"History is hardly ever as straightforward and simple as we something believe it to be. The same goes for people like J. Robert Oppenheimer. In learning about World War II and the development of the atomic bomb, the thing I remembered the most was that he was a brilliant man who was suspected of being a communist, thereby tarnishing his legacy. That however seems to be somewhat of the straightforward simple history we tend to like.Yet if this movie is as accurate as is claimed, a theorist (not just a theoretical physicist) might have an intellectual interest in leftist (specifically communist) ideas while, simultaneously, never fully committing. This was a theme touched on throughout the movie in which Oppenheimer was, in several instances, content to stick with theory.When the Trinity test then took place and he saw what came from theory being put into practice, I do believe that fundamentally changed him. Wrestling with the unleashing of such power and knowing he led the scientists responsible for it, should really change anyone with a conscience.What this picture does really well is show Oppenheimer neither as a saint who might have saved millions of lives at the cost of hundreds of thousands, nor as a sinner caught up in communism as might have been the case during the era of Joseph McCarthy and the Cold War. Rather, he was a man as brilliant as he was defiant, ordered as he was rogue, disciplines as he was cavalier. I believe Nolan, as the primary screenwriter and obviously director, respects us as the audience enough to leave it up to us to draw our own conclusions."
"The story is presented really well and through the eyes of Oppenheimer. 90% of the movie feels like a flashback scene which though looks really cool, doesn't actually feel like something I would watch again. As in classic Nolan style 3 timelines are running simultaneously - before the atom bomb dropped, after and the present. I feel like this could have been handled better especially in the second half of the movie. The two main events in the movies the bomb explosion and the last act felt underwhelming. Actually the bomb explosion scene for which everyone was waiting so intently for was underwhelming beyond belief - Nolan should have used CGI 100%, it looked like an explosion from the 90s. There were so many characters and sub-stories that it felt like someone compressed an entire tv series into a 3 hour long movie.Movie critics will give this a good score owing to its incredible style and presentation and most of the audience will do the same. But purely from an entertainment point of view this was 7/10."
"It Just Didn't Live up to the Hype, it's Not Good Enough.Quick Sidenote 1 - Who Else Noticed Cillain Murphys' Face in the Underground Place, when he Looked at that Guy and Cillain Murphys' Cheekbones and Crazed EYES Were Disturbing as Hell? Was Cillian Murphy Really the Grim Reaper? 💀Quick Sidenote 2 - Apart from People who Love Movies Shot on Film and the ""Nolan can't do a Thing Wrong and even when he does we won't acknowledge it Crowd"". General Audiences won't Get into this Film (From my Observation of Todays IMAX Viewing), it's not that the General Audiences are Dumb (Some are though). It's Christopher Nolan and his (Lately anyway) inability to Convey the Plotline with as Least Noise (Confusion not actual Sound) as Possible.Here's how to Immensely Improve the Film -1. It's Too Long and Convoluted, Roughly Around When Matt Damon Meets Oppenheimer, That's when they should Of Started the Film, 10-15 Minutes of Backstory and then Matt Damon Meets Oppenheimer, That's the Correct Decision For the Film.2. Stop Constantly Cutting Back and Forth to Different Timelines, you can do it but not Constantly. It Breaks Immersion.3. The Sub-Plotline between Florence Pugh and Cillian Murphy was Pointless (For what I would have done within the Story). Get rid of it.4. The Family Drama Between Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt was more Snore and More Bore. Get rid of it.5. The Film is Over Scored (Although the Score is Magnificent), because of this, the Score is Less and Less Effective as Time Goes on. Dial it Back on Score.6. Focus more on the Team Building the Atom Bomb, with them going back and forth with eachother, internal struggles about the project, uncertainty about the project etc.7. This Particular Film is Too Long for the Material Presented. Cut 30 to 40 Minutes out of the Film.8. The Atomic Explosion, yh not Good Enough. When a Large part of your Marketing is seeing an Atom Bomb going Off in IMAX, you better Deliver. It half Delivered. It needed that Gigantic Mushroom Cloud and an Astonishing Shot. Sigh 😔, there's no Astonishing Shot. The Sound After was Good Though.9. Instead of that Political Court Drama, The Film should of ended like this. After the Trinity Test, the Film needed to Ratchet-Up things Further by Dropping Fatman and Little Boy on Japan and to see 2 More Gigantic Mushroom Clouds in IMAX Ratio with Different Shots, Both Aerial and Ground Shots.Build Up to that, not a damn court room Drama, get that Tension going and Oppenheimer Massively unsure about what is about to happen And Finally End it with a Portrait Shot of Cillian Murphy (Whilst the Spectacular Score Booms) in Dismay about what he had Created. I don't want to hear about it on a Radio 📻😔.This Actual Film -1. The IMAX aspect Ratio Cinematography was Ok, some Beautiful Shots.2. The Performances Across the Board Were Strong.3. The Score is Spectacular but there's too much Score which Detracts from its effectiveness as time goes on.4. The Scenes between the Team of Scientists Going back and Forth with eachother over theory and Predictions were Great to See.5. The Tension and Build up Towards and During the Trinity Test were Really Strong.If I could Phrase the Oppenheimer film in one Phrase, it would be -""It did well enough here and it did well enough there but that's not Good Enough"""
"Patience growing thin! Dunkirk-Ok, Tenet-Really, Oppie-Oh Come on!.Fan of Nolan but seriously as a Non-American, it does not concern me. Where is the 'entertainment' element here??I am not bothered with what US of A did with their brilliance as it has never reflected herself to be a just country.All the actors did an outstanding job but after 3 hours if Russel Crowe asked me then no, I am not entertained!Don't care if its art or biopic or whatever.Also, the back and forth timeline is not appealing anymore.....its time to let time flow as usual now!I think Nolan takes a back seat for now while Guy Ritchie goes ahead!"
"It's not often I say that. Joker, American History X, and now Oppenheimer are 3 phenomenal movies that I'll never watch again.Why?Oppenheimer was a fantastic portrayal of Robert J. Oppenheimers life pre, during and post Manhattan Project.The atomic bomb scene was an absolute cinematic masterpiece, and one of the best film moments of recent years (or decades)
The movie is an incredibly heavy 3 hour biopic that never slows down. It's a heavy watch, but the payoff is phenomenal.Cillian Murphy puts on his best cinematic performance yet, and Christopher Nolan takes us through his story in an expertly crafted movie.It's as close as I can get to being a perfect movie, but one that I'll likely never revisit.If you haven't seen it, go while it's in Theatres."
"This three-plus hour biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is a film about faces. They talk, a lot. They listen. They react to good and bad news. And sometimes they get lost in their own heads - none more so than the title character, the supervisor of the nuclear weapons team at Los Alamos whose apocalyptic contribution to science earned him the nickname; The American Prometheus.Cillian Murphy, staring with icy blue eyes, dominates the film, playing Robert Oppenheimer with a restraint that perfectly suits this charismatic yet chilly character. The story takes us from his student days in Europe, to his time as a professor in California in the 1930s and then to the Manhattan Project, the top-secret US programme to build nuclear weapons in Los Alamos, New Mexico, where his team races to create a bomb to end World War II. Murphy keeps us with him even when the character seems a bit opaque.The film is framed as a head-to-head battle between Oppenheimer and his nemesis, Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr), former head of the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). Throughout, Nolan's screenplay goes back and forth between two US government hearings in the 1950s which play like tense courtroom dramas, flashing back in long stretches to tell the story of Oppenheimer's life.Early on, there's a flash forward to the 1954 hearing of the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission that ultimately resulted in Oppenheimer, accused (among other things) of having hidden Communist ties, being stripped of his security clearance. This was the government's way of silencing him, since in the postwar world he'd become something of a dove on the issue of nuclear weapons. The hearing was the darkest chapter of Oppenheimer's life and using it as a framing device feels, at first, like a very standard thing to do.The film speaks quite often of one of the principles of quantum physics, which holds that observing quantum phenomena by a detector or an instrument can change the results of this experiment. The editing illustrates it by constantly re-framing our perception of an event to change its meaning and the script does it by adding new information that undermines, contradicts or expands our sense of why a character did something, or whether they even knew why they did it.How Nolan captures these sequences - the quiet before the sound of the explosion; the disquieting, thunderous, flag-waving applause that greets Oppenheimer after - are masterful, unforgettable fusions of sound and image, horror and awe. Christopher Nolan's complex, vivid portrait of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the ""father of the atomic bomb,"" is a brilliant achievement in formal and conceptual terms.The film's furiously entropic tendencies complement the theoretical discussions of the how's and why's of the individual and collective personality. To greater and lesser degrees, all of the characters are appearing before a tribunal and bring called to account for their contradictions, hypocrisies and sins. The tribunal is out there in the dark. We've been given the information but not told what to decide, which is as it should be. As Nolan reminds you, the world quickly moved on from the horrors of the war to embrace the bomb. Now we, too, have become death, the destroyers of worlds."
"I enjoyed this film very much. The actors were very well chosen. The three hours passed quite quickly which is a sign to me that a movie is successfully engaging.I kept hearing on the ads that you should see it in IMAX. As a musician, I don't need that ""score"" blasting at me for three hours. There were relatively few special effects sounds which required the IMAX system. The music score was one of those which just keep repeating and driving itself into your brain. (I would have loved to have seen this film with a score by John Williams, Danny Elfman or Michael Giacchino)Despite that I highly recommend Oppenheimer."
"Even with 3 hours sleep and a stomach ache for most of the day I didn't yawn once I was absolutely captivated/enthralled more than I thought I would be. This better be up for at least 10 nominations! It's very impressive how Christopher Nolan wrote and directed such an in depth crafty art political brilliance filled ironic to my sleep amount of this long winded extravaganza that is well acted throughout. I have autism I crave quantum mechanics, I even understood the numerous studies science related. One of the best Christoper Nolan films of his career, my last name is Nolan too I wish I was related to him! The sound design throughout is exceptional I'm sure that'll even win an award. I'm glad despite feeling rough today I got to see Oppenheimer with my mom and sister Emily."
"It's gratifying to know that in a supposedly ""dumbed down"" America, a three-hour docudrama about a theoretical physicist and his atomic ""project,"" along with a closed-door security clearance hearing and an open Senate confirmation hearing, both full of dialogue and minimal ""action,"" is generating a huge, but deservedly so, box office. I found this film mesmerizing as the three hours seem to fly by for me. It has a very intelligent script, some masterful acting, and a focus on a fascinating, if enigmatic, character, i.e., Oppenheimer. The ""father"" of the atomic bomb was, indeed, a genius and generous-minded (on occasion), but also exhibited character flaws, and for such an adept administrator was also politically naïve.The physicists behind the letter to FDR knew Germany had a head start in nuclear power (Germany under Otto Hahn was the first nation to split the atom), and it would have been a dangerous world indeed if Hitler had a monopoly on the atomic bomb, but those same physicists were reluctant to use it against Japan in the waning days of the Pacific War, and Oppenheimer shared some of their reservations. The subsequent guilt he felt was manifest in a great scene in the film where he meets with Truman and says he has blood on his hands. Truman barks to him: ""no you don't; you built it but I authorized its use."" Later in the film, where he's being humiliated at the security clearance hearing, his psychologically astute wife asks him why is he putting up with this in person....""you must need this humiliation as penance for your guilt.""Kudos to Nolan for not, at least explicitly, tying the use of the two bombs to Japan's surrender. In fact, except for one high level meeting where potential targets are discussed, there's almost zero real-time reference to Hiroshima, Nagasaki, or the battleship Missouri. It's almost folklore in U. S. history, but not elsewhere, that the two bombs were solely crucial in bringing about a surrender from a fanatical enemy, but although most of us Americans don't want to believe this, Soviet entry into the war against Japan (at our behest; see Yalta) was probably more crucial. The 5-year Soviet-Japan Neutrality Pact offered some hope to Japan's War Cabinet that a negotiated settlement could moderately soften the blow of unconditional surrender. When the Soviet Union invaded Manchuria that hope was irretrievably gone and the Japanese leadership was shocked. There are more references to Soviet entry into the war in the minutes of the War Cabinet than the the atomic bombs which were indeed appalling to the leadership. The Soviets invaded the Kuril Islands and had plans, if the war continued, of invading Japan's large northern island of Hokkaido. The War Cabinet wanted no parts of a Soviet, even if shared, occupation of any of the home islands.Another historical issue is prompted by the film, and that is the veiled depiction that the physicists who were Jewish seemed more interested (if necessary) in using the bomb against Nazi Germany (who could blame them as emigres) but very reluctant to use it against Japan in the closing days. There's one pre-war scene where Oppenheimer meets Heisenberg in Germany, and as depicted, it's a fairly amiable meeting. Heisenberg's WW II impact is interesting. He apparently led the German nuclear effort which was subsequently found to be not very far along. Why, with the head start they had? Some explanations: (1) Speer did not allocate sufficient financial resources, (2) a negative opinion on Heisenberg is that he tried hard but made lots of mistakes, (3) a positive opinion on Heisenberg is that he purposely sabotaged the Nazi effort, and (4) theoretical physics in Nazi Germany was referred to as Jewish physics."
"Oppenheimer is a rare biopic which, in spite of being driven entirely by dialogue and character drama, never bored me at any point. I was so amazed by the film that even after many a times not understanding the scientific stuff and all, I was glued to the screen, understanding it through the characters and their actions alone. I loved every bit of it and was totally focused. Once it was over, I walked out with a sense of satisfaction.Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan's masterpiece which he has painted with the help of talented actors such as Cillian Murphy who has sunken his teeth into the portrayal of the protagonist. He dominates every scene he is in, and I'm hoping he definitely gets an Oscar nod next year. If not him, then at least Robert Downey Jr. Deserves one for sure. His electrifying performance is so good you won't even think about seeing an old Tony Stark at all. Similarly terrific are Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Florence Pugh who leave the desired impact.The first half focuses on the character more than the main explosion which is later showcased in one of the most ingenious and cinematically remarkable ways. That means I should also warn you to not come merely for the explosion. This is a heavy dialogue-driven drama with little bit of action and almost no violence. A thriller feel is maintained throughout with the help of the background score, and that makes many scenes more intriguing to watch. I personally felt the human drama of Oppenheimer was more appealing than the explosion itself, because that is what this film is actually about: his life before and after the nuclear test. The film also excels in the technical departments; the sound editing is truly remarkable, and will make you hold your breath multiple times.I must say Oppenheimer turned out to be even better than what I had imagined. It was nowhere boring to be fair, and that's rare for a movie which is so long and driven entirely by conversations. Those who blindly follow the hype and go for fun are bound to be disappointed because this biographical & political courtroom drama has neither the set pieces nor the sci-fi of Nolan's previous movies. It is the kind of film which gets better with subsequent viewings. I'm just glad it made me return to the big screen after months and delivered what I paid for. The only sad part is, there's no IMAX near me, otherwise I'd have gone a second time too."
"Oppenheimer is a biopic of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer(Cillian Murphy). Dr. Oppenheimer faces all kinds of hurdles, both internal & external, during his crucial role in developing the atomic bomb, during World War II.Oppenheimer is a mind-blowing film. Writer-director Christopher Nolan has given us another masterpiece, after Memento(2000), The Dark Knight Trilogy(2005-2012), The Prestige(2006), Inception(2010), Interstellar(2014), Dunkirk(2017) & Tenet(2020). This movie is a must watch in IMAX. You feel like you are right there with the soldiers & scientists, when they're testing the atomic bomb, during the Manhattan Project. Your seats start vibrating, the sound effects are earth-shattering & the visuals are crystal clear & ultra-realistic. This is because Nolan didn't use any CGI to recreate the nuclear explosions seen in the film. This is absolutely phenomenal! The cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema is breathtaking. The background score by Ludwig Goransson is epic. You will be on the edge of your seat, throughout. Cillian Murphy is the star of the show, as J. Robert Oppenheimer. Murphy expertly portrays the rollercoaster of emotions both subtle & not so subtle, that his character goes through during the course of the movie. Cillian Murphy's spectacular performance as the titular character, is the highlight of the film. Robert Downey Jr is outstanding as Lewis Strauss. Emily Blunt is phenomenal as Kitty Oppenheimer. Matt Damon is fantastic as Leslie Groves. Florence Pugh is amazing as Jean Tatlock. The supporting cast is brilliant. Oppenheimer is a must watch(especially in IMAX) for Christopher Nolan fans, Cillian Murphy fans & pretty much everyone else. It deserves all the Oscars at next year's Academy Awards. We will be discussing the impact of this movie, for years to come!"
"Clear your shelves, Christopher Nolan and many of those involved in the making of his new movie OPPENHEIMER, you're going to need the space for the many, many trophies you are going to receive next spring.Based on the life of the ""Father of the Atomic Bomb"", J. Robert Oppenheimer, Nolan's latest epic is a rarity in today's Motion Picture landscape - a prestige picture, bankrolled lavishly, filmed gorgeously and populated with a veritable who's who of ""A"" list actors that tells a complex story of a complicated man who ends up remorseful of what he has unleashed in this world.And it works very, very well.Nolan regular, Cillian Murphy, is equal parts quirky, driven, determined and haunted in his multi-layered performance as the titular character - who is in almost every scene of this 3 hour film. He is fascinating to watch and his ""more internal than external"" performance draws the audience in throughout the events depicted in this film. It is the Best Performance of the career of one of the most interesting actors of this generation and one should not be surprised if his name is called during awards season next year.Murphy is capably supported by a long list of strong performers giving strong performances in roles that are much smaller than ones they normally receive. Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett(!), Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Matthew Modine, Kenneth Branagh (of course, it's a Nolan film), Jason Clarke and Alden Ehrenreich bring their ""A"" game to roles that could have been thrown away.Also, good ol' Tom Conti (one of the most interesting actors from the late '70's and early '80's) shows up in this film as Albert Einstein and reminds us all why he is such a good performer...and...wait until you see who shows up for one scene in this film as President Harry S. Truman!Oh...and don't forget Emily Blunt (as Oppenheimer's wife) and (surprisingly) Robert Downey, Jr. (as a politician using Oppenheimer for his own purposes). Both of them put in Award-winning-level uspporting performances, elevating two ""A"" list actors to the ""A+ list"".But this film is more than just it's performers. Nolan demands - and receives - top notch work from the Cinematographer, the Sound Designer, the Editor, the Costume Designer and the Composer (Ludwig Goranssson, NOT Nolan regular Hans Zimmer). They (along with Nolan) craft a beautifully made and put together film that will dazzle the senses. If you get a chance, see this film in a movie theater and, if you can, see it in either iMAX or 70mm, you will be glad you did.What holds this film back - just a little bit - is the story that is being told. Nolan (as he is want to do) plays with time and pretty frenetically cuts back and forth between about 4 different timelines to tell this story. It's effective most of the time, but at other times, it becomes distracting and....with a 3 hour run time...does drag a bit at times.But these are quibbles to a film that is ""as good as it gets"" by the BEST DIRECTOR plying his trade today. It is another triumph for Nolan and he will be making many, many acceptance speeches in just a few short months.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
"There are a few other reviews here echoing the same sentiments. I asked the people sitting next to me what they thought and they were disappointed. I can't help feel the same. I have a strong background in nuclear physics. It was intriguing, but it was cut so jarringly that it was hard to keep up what was going on.Then finally, we have the big event that everyone was selling this movie on, and it was quite underwhelming. The characters don't do enough to catch my feelings. The only standouts for me were Robert Downey Jr and Emily Blunt, but RDJ's whole character arc was that he was insecure and just wanted petty revenge??The whole last hour I was checking the time hoping it would end, because I was just bored."
"I expected a thrilling story about building THE bomb. Almost NONE of that. What the what?This is firstmost a political witchhunt story, the likes of which we can see everyday now on CNN. And it honestly is incredibly boring having to watch these ENDLESS commisions and administrative interviews of people wanting to know if they are patriotic enough or not and if they have had ""contact"" with the Russians.BAD nr 1: NO REAL THRILL or DRAMA.I mean, I was really expecting some thrilling story about building and dropping this atomic bomb, but it was 90% nothing but nonstop commision TALK and political TALK and boring science TALK and some husband and wife TALK. NO thrill at all in that! Only a tiny bit of drama at the end.THE BAD nr 2: TOO LONG, WAY TOO LONG3 blipping hours long! If you would walk in 45 minutes late into the theatre, you would NOT have missed any thing. I am dead serious. Finally after 45 minutes they actually start building this bomb, the only actual excting part of this entire movie. Then they start TALKING in commisions about politics again! (Deep sigh).THE BAD nr 3: TOO MANY CHARACTERS, TOO MANY STORYLINESThere are WAY to many characters and these MANY actors dont even excell. Even Robert Downey, who does have a prominent leading role, is not impressing me. He OVERacts. And he looks kinda silly with his impression of an old (balding) man. It just doesnt look believable. And take Matt Damon for instance, trying to act like a tough military boffin with his fake mustache. I had to giggle everytime I saw him. And a lot of other actors, simply were miscast as well.It wants to be a personal portrait of Oppenheimer, THAT seems obvious, the blipping movie is named after him. But there is an INCREDIBLY longwinding political storyline as well. AND a husband and wife storyline. AND a science storyline as well. AND a mighty moral storyline which has to (supposedly) bring all these storylines together, but simply doesnt.Not any good? The ONE redeeming feature of this movie is the acting performance by Cillian Murphy. He is solid. Not Oscar worthy or anything, but solid. But only 1 out of SO many actors, being good, is not okay for me.My hopes were high. They were destroyed within the first 30 minutes. It never recovered.What a boring dud of a movie. Highly (artificially) overrated. Perhaps best suited for arthouse movie fans with a LOT of patience...?"
"I align with other reviewers here who have found this. Despite the hype surrounding it, Oppenheimer fell short of expectations. The film proved to be tedious and at many times draining to watch.I liked the cinematography but the beautiful scenes had an overwhelmingly loud background score that drowned out most of the dialogue and made it hard to comprehend what was going on.The movie also had several disjointed scene transitions which in my opinion, because of lack of character development and loud background music, only added to the confusion, making it hard to follow the plot coherently. Overall, a disappointing experience that failed to live up to its hype."
"The captivating drama was carried away by supremely talented actors, with Cilian Murphy skillfully portraying the complex character of J. Robert Oppenheimer. After a long hiatus, RDJ (Acting POV) finally gets the recognition he deserves. The background music (BGM) is extraordinary, and the cinematography is exhilarating. Although I haven't read Kai Bird's ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer"" yet, I have watched NBC's latest documentary titled ""To End All War: Oppenheimer & The Atomic Bomb,"" which is more convenient to grasp as a whole. However, Nolan's portrayal of Oppenheimer was superior from an subjective point of view."
"This film is a damn masterpiece. There are not enough words to propperly describe it and, at the same time, few sentences can truly explain how good this film is. And i can't say its flawless, but its ""flaws"" are so escarce and so minimum that the don't really matter.First thing I want to mention about this work of art is the acting performances. With a cast so stacked of stars, you would think some of them may not have the expected performances or even enough screen time (which I think is something that happened to Rami Malek, whose talent seemed a bit underappreciated): but it is the exact opposite. Everyone's performances are top tier, charismatic, powerful, memorable. It sounds too optimistic but they really are, but this is also due to the opportunities the film offers; it's almost three hours of intense, long, fast dialogues, in an exchange of politics, philosophy and physics terminology; and I have to be very honest here, this is not a story that can be missed even a bit. You may come after a brief bathroom break and find yourself lost in the plot. But it's all worth the attention. Its pace is perfect, and the three hours go by like nothing.Then we have, of course, the soundtrack and the photography, two aspects that are always perfectly taken care of in Nolan's films. So adecuate, so well prepared, you feel like every scene matters, you don't want to miss a single shot, a single sound.But what really surprised me and the thing I enjoyed the most is that the film talks about many other topics that are not shown in the trailer, so you come into it with an expectation and receive much more.With time, I'm sure it will be considered as a classic film, one of the best of 2020's decade, for shure."
"This movie is an experience. The direction, cinematography and music will take you away. The performances from all the main actors are Oscar worthy. This movie will defy your expectations. Cillian Murphy is definitely Oscar's number 1 contender.Now I understand that this may not be every person's cup of tea. Some people are seriously going to this movie expecting to have a "" fun"" time. Tho movie speaks about ""probably"" the world's biggest catastrophe EVER. Some conversations are very heavy to bear but this is the world we live in and the choices humans and governments make every day.Can't wait to see Barbie next."
"This isn't my type of film, I normally get bored or find the slow pace just loses my interest, my dad wanted to see this so I thought I'd go and give it a chance.It's a 3 hour film that actually flies by, it's so engrossing and engaging, the characters are so different and well portrayed, the cast is great, the twists and turns are surprising and you leave unsure of how to feel about so much of it.The one caveat is , like any historic movie, it's told from a perspective, there's No guarantee conversations or meeting went a certain way of it the content us accurate so I think stuff with the president for example could be taken a bit lightly.Overall it's brilliant, can't pick a fault, the lead was remarkable, I loved Matt Damon to. So much to praise, I literally can't find a fault.Even has Einstein."
"I want to thanks to Chritoper Nolan that make this film be perfect. I have just knew that Robert Oppenheim is a man which make the atom bomb. This story in this film also make me speechless because I was influenced not to leave a single sentence on the screen. The bomb explosion is also very realistic, maybe that's what differentiates Nolan compared to other directors who prefer to use CGI. This film also tells about complex matters regarding life decisions taken by Oppenheimer, I like Oppenheimer's life principles without mentioning other stories. Thanks to C. Nolan for this very beautiful film."
"Nolan strangely moves from petentious films, bad ones right away after you take the glitter away, to straight ahead masterworks of movie making. He seams to go 1 good 1 bad each time. Now it was time for a good one after the pretentious, sloppy Tenet. And boy did he deliver. This is a wonderful, challenging, unapologetic, very brave in some political way piece of movie making. Well acted all along, well written, large in scope but fully accomplishing. But it's what lies underneath what I love the most. I'm totally in love with the political subplots: younger generations need to be reminded not only about the dangers of the bomb, but for the equally killing Macarthysms. Call it how you want it, the blind, stupid far righters are a danger to the world."
"What an amazing movie, the visuals, sound, music, acting, directing, everything was 10/10, dont watch the film without knowing some history, its very philosophical type of movie, it makes you question about your actions, reflect on life, consequences, every minute of 3hr was amazing there was no boring scene, very good pacing, I understand its not meant for all audiences, yeah some scenes maybe could have been avoided but regardless the purpose of the movie was executed, definitely the type of movie that will be remembered for a long time. We can already expect it to leas best picture, actor, supporting actor, actress, sound, score, director, adapted screenplay and many more,"
"Oppenheimer tracks one of the most important and terrifying events in the history of the world in epic fashion, creating a mature spectacle on a scale that's unheard of and feels like the culmination of all of Christopher Nolan's preoccupations whilst still breaking new ground. It's a sobering look at our impending doom.Cillian Murphy has been a long time Nolan collaborator but here he's finally given the spotlight and he's obviously amazing. He brings an incredible level of confidence to Oppenheimer that morphs into a constantly horrified and guilty presence in the later moments, able to express that fear and horror without any words.Robert Downey Jr. Is phenomenal here, it's the best he's been in ages. Strauss is a calm presence with his own agendas and a grudge to bear, a perfect way to go against type for Downey and a bold career choice following being in the biggest thing of all time (and Dolittle) that pays off magnificently.The rest of the cast is full of big names, most are only present for a handful of scenes but they all bring 100% to their roles and highlights include Benny Safdie with a superb accent and Emily Blunt who gets a standout scene when she goes toe to toe with Jason Clarke.Christopher Nolan's direction is perfect along with Hoyte Van Hoytema's breathtaking cinematography that reaffirms he's a master of the craft (especially IMAX). The film jumps back and forth between two stories, one in colour and the other in Black and White that makes the film feel like a smartly constructed puzzle that's easy to follow.Also, the much hyped Trinity test sequence is one of the most thrilling and awe inspiring moments of the year. Using a delayed reaction to get as much tension out of the build up as humanly possible and the fact that it was done practically just makes it even more mind blowing.Ludwig Göransson's score is another huge win. It manages to be so many things at once without breaking. Both modern and old fashioned, sweeping and triumphant yet also unnerving. It ratchets up the tension beautifully and confirms he's a perfect fit for Nolan's films."
"Great acting, score, cinematography. Script was a let down - some of the themes felt questionably heavy handed, leading to the end result quite confused in terms of message.Same applies to character work - even after 3 long hours, I still don't feel like I know or empathise with Oppenheimer any better than if I had just read his Wikipedia page.Don't even get me started on the female characters, who (in Christopher Nolan fashion) have little to zero character development: one of them is either naked or dead for 3/4 of her screen time.Overall, the movie seemed to sit on the fence for or just never expand on most of the philosophical and moral problems, so it ends up feeling 90% plot and 10% anything thematic, leaving me with the conclusion of 'Oppie was a complex dude'.7.5/10."
"I'm a huge Nolan fan since his first film. My favorite is still Memento, which is thorough and slow and very dialogue heavy as well as philosophical. I have a friend who works in Los Alamos as a chemical engineer and have visited the area as well as heard plenty about Oppenheimer and the way he changed the world. The importance of scientists and especially theoretical physicists is not lost on me. Between all that and my love for Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt, I'd been looking forward to this movie for a long time.That said, my entire group was disappointed with this movie, starting with the run time. I ask you, how is it possible that a three hour movie can feel rushed?! Somehow Nolan managed it. The first hour of the film feels so fast, disjointed and erratic that it gives you anxiety. He breezes over the most important parts of Oppenheimer's life and elaborates more on scenes that never happened (such as the ones with Einstein). The movie should be about a great man with conflicting emotions and instead we get political tripe with entirely fictional material. The real Oppenheimer had such an interesting life and personality that there was no need to embellish or insert so much random nudity, politics and Matt Damon. I'm still wondering what Nolan's point was in making this film. Why not just make a documentary if you're going to make such a boring lackluster story? There's just nothing here to pull you in and we really paid close attention. Eric Weinstein should have been consulted so we could have had a better movie discussing the plight of actual scientists in this country and how they are treated by our government. Tell the story of how secrets are kept from the scientific community to protect governments rather than citizens in order to slow progress and divert attention elsewhere. Whatever Nolan's point was, it was lost somewhere in the three hours of cameos and more anti Russian propaganda."
"It is fitting that a film about a person as consequential as Oppenheimer ended up being crafted by one of the most visionary directors of our time. Oppenheimer is a victory for filmmaking, a tour de force of incredible visuals, breathtaking cinematography and a sweeping scope that makes this narrative so illuminating. Every single aspect of this film blends into a seamless, awe inspiring experience where despite its gargantuan runtime, we are transfixed to a portrait of a man who's legend will forever be written in history. Brought alive by a phenomenon Cillian Murphy, Oppenheimer is the single greatest argument that movies and the theatrical experience still can mean something. If you watch this, definitely watch in 70mm IMAX - it's so worth it.Nolan has done what Hollywood desperately needed - make a coherent argument that filmmaking deserves a place in the pantheon of twenty first century art."
"A very neat biopic for a life story as complex as Robert Oppenheimer's. With his original back and forth filmmaking style, though I still like Interstellar better, I think this is Christopher Nolan's best work to date.The casting is great. Even for a short screen time, important characters showed up played by huge star such as Casey Affleck and Gary Oldman. The scoring is good enough even though I still think Hans Zimmer is one of major keys Nolan's movies are as good as they are (Batman, Inception, Interstellar, etc.). The ending is very powerful just like what Nolan did with The Dark Knight, Inception and Interstellar. It is the highlight of the movie for me."
"I can't express enough how absolutely phenomenal this movie is. It will stand the test of time and will possibly go down in history as one of the greatest films ever made.The movie is three hours long and at no point does it lose your attention. Cillian Murphy should, and probably will, get nominated for an Oscar. And he probably will get it. I don't want to spoil anything, but from the practical visual effects, to every single performance, every aspect of this movie is inspiring. I saw it the weekend it came out and will be buying the blu-ray as soon as it is released.I would also like to add that Robert Downey Jr. Should also be nominated for an Oscar because he absolutely nailed his performance in every way possible. I highly recommend seeing this on the big screen. I assure you, you won't be disappointed. Me, my wife, and my 19 year old son were all completely blown away."
"My expectations are always high for a film made by Christopher Nolan who oversees the whole production whilst directing and writing it, he never lets me down and for this feature film, a biopic about the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a theoretical physicist who was pivotal in developing the first nuclear weapons as part of the Manhattan Project, and thereby ushering in the Atomic Age. What we get is a three hour biopic of Oppenheimer's life and in my opinion each minute and each scene is used to the fullest. My girlfriend thought it was too long though so I think it's a preference. You could say the black and white scenes which have a different perspective character entirely, to be unnecessary for the story told and that's fair, but in my opinion it's a perspective character which is needed. Stories can easily become biased but with a perspective character like Strauss makes us see how others see Robert Oppenheimer and it only helps the story Christopher Nolan is telling. Any fan of Christopher Nolan knows how he likes a non linear story, he does it here and It's done perfectly. Alternating between Oppenheimer's story from Cambridge to Los Alamos, his security hearing in 1954, and Strauss' confirmation hearing in 1959.Cillian Murphy stars as J. Robert Oppenheimer, with Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife Katherine ""Kitty"" Oppenheimer; Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project; and Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss, a senior member of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. The ensemble supporting cast includes Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman, Kenneth Branagh and Benny Safdie. The cast is full of phenomenal actors, each portraying a real figure. Nolan even got Matt Damon out of taking a break from acting, Damon's role in the film is far from the best I've seen but I'm certain he did a terrific job portraying General Groves. The best performance goes to Cillian Murphy, hands down. He has been in multiple of Christopher Nolan's films and lots of others, but never in a leading role like this. Peaky Blinders were always the best performance which I have seen of his, but that changed with his role of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Portraying a person who has existed and one with the reputation of Oppenheimer, makes it you either fail or succeed. I'm sure Cillian Murphy nailed each mannerism, you see it through his performance how he pays respect to the real figure, for example the weight loss. He should be nominated for best actor and as it looks like right now, win multiple awards for the performance, the best performance of his career or so is my opinion. Other performances which I really liked and found memorable, Robert Downey Jr and Matt Damon to name a few. Though brief, Tom Conti was terrific as Albert Einstein and I could easily see a biopic be made with him in the role.Christopher Nolan did it again, a film which is looking to be a huge box office success and he does it in a way which seems oddly new to Hollywood, Nolan never changed as it was Hollywood who did. I'm of course talking about the over-reliance of CGI and visual effects. The big explosion in the film which is as real as you can get without actually blowing up a real atomic bomb, he uses practical effects and creates a stunning looking film because of it. You get immersed and the thought of things being fake never crosses your mind, because it aren't. Of course there's CGI in the film but used sparingly like the shots in space. It's a visually striking movie which Nolan has made and the IMAX only makes it so much grander. Ludwig Göransson is yet again working with Christopher Nolan and I can say they're a brilliant duo. Nolan had advised him to use the violin for Oppenheimer's central theme in the film, with Göransson remarking that he had felt that it could go from ""the most romantic, beautiful tone in a split second to neurotic and heart wrenching, horror sounds"". This might be Ludwig's best musical score, it just might.Christopher Nolan began writing the script for Oppenheimer after he had finished Tenet, he had been envisioning the film for over 20 years before that. A primary theme of Oppenheimer is dealing with the consequences of Oppenheimer's actions, with Nolan opting to explore how consequences can affect people in a delayed manner as he felt people are not ""necessarily confronted with the strongest or worst elements of your action in the moment"". I just think it's a fantastic screenplay, it also worked very well with it being written in first person which was a first for the director. The writing is perfect, like so much else. If I should find something to criticize, I would say the writing for its female characters. But honestly, it's alright, I don't mind and my girlfriend didn't mind either. This is a film about Oppenheimer, we get to see the story through his eyes and his eyes only, except for Robert Downey Jr's character.Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times awarded Oppenheimer a perfect four out of four stars, describing it as ""magnificent"" and ""one of the best films of the 21st century"". Many critics share his opinion and honestly, I do too. Oppenheimer is on my top three films of Nolan's, The Dark Knight remains my favorite, but this is close to that. This might be one of the best films I've seen in the last year or two and I agree fully with ""one of the best films of the 21st century""."
"10 stars are not enough. This film is written stupendously well, the script is so intricate and complex it befits the mind of an uber genius like Oppenheimer explored by the genius of Nolan.There's nothing here I can add which hasn't already been said about the acting, the cinematography, the tools used to create ambience and mood, the music, the direction.Once in a while it is an absolute pleasure to go to the theatre, and watching Oppenheimer as IMAX experience made it so much more worth it.Congratulations Christopher Nolan and the entire massive team that helped and supported the making of this remarkable film. And thank you for it."
"Wow! This movie just knocked me out! So many parts of the movie were just excellent. I think I need a little time to fully process everything.. but I left the theater just in awe of the movie. Acting, script, cinematography, directing, score, sound, and visuals... were all just amazing.Nolan really knows how to make a really powerful film. It leaves you asking questions about war, and how the atomic bomb really changed things. I only had a few small issues with the film. It does sort of peak about 2/3 of the way through the film. At least in terms of actions of the film. Then it asks questions about what happens after you invent and use an atomic bomb. Really powerful stuff.. and it kept me interested the whole time.I loved seeing it in IMAX.. with the powerful sound especially. Although if you only get to see it in a regular theater.. that is ok too. But in a theater is the best way to see it for sure. Really awesome and it's such an inventive and powerful movie."
"I had loved nolan since he did memento some of his films like interstellar and tenet were let down for me but this films brings him back in the game.The problem with both interstellar and tenet was the film was grand but i felt the human element was missing in this film the human element takes precedence in Oppenheimer
"" this is easily in his top three films ""the film is ambitious and it ticks all the boxes after watching i can't but draw comparison to the social network and believe me that's huge complement.Murphy did great job of portraying Oppenheimer he was nuanced and charismatic at the same time,robert downey jr. Was also great in this
i wont be surprised if rdj wins oscar for this."
"Christopher Nolan, whose previous works use time and space as his playground, did it once again with this based on a true story film, something that we didn't expect. His way of storytelling proves that he's the greatest directors to ever live on the planet, mastering in building up the story all the while keeping the audience engaged by elevating its suspense, scope, atmosphere and music tempos, creating a masterpiece ouevre.Oppenheimer is a visceral experience. It is able to create and provoke tension and anxiety in their audience. Rarely do we ever get this type of films offering this kind of experience but Nolan did it, just like Interstellar or Inception. It is haunting. It is moving. It is evocative. It knows what it tries to deliver and it does so well in eliciting these emotions as you sit and witness through it all.Out of the 2 dozens of famous actors in this film, we have to give special shout outs to 4 of them namely Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. & Jason Clarke. Cillian Murphy is able to tell Oppenheimer's story largely from the looks and expressions of his face, a true work of art. His face just tells everything, like a grandeur painting that moves accordingly to the beat of the story and emotions. Emily Blunt as Mrs Oppenheimer is just impeccable. Her performance is so good, there was once scene that made us cried a bit. That 'it' scene that will appear on the screen as her name is called as one of the nominees for Best Supporting Actress and hell yes, we have high hope she will win next year's Academy Awards for this! Downey and Clarke are both impressive as well, 2 characters that are very good at spoken dialogues and they really did their homework to study the characters very well.We are truly in love with the dialogues. It is rich with contexts and it feels very densed. We just love the fact that the speed and pacing of the dialogues are almost similar to Aaron Sorkin's materials who directed The Social Network and Molly's Game. Dialogues are spoken incessantly, word after word, without putting a full stop for audience to breathe. And these dialogues really enrich and enhance the film's build-up, settings and mood that elevate the whole immersive experience.These dialogues, most of them, are necessary for the story and character developments. What are or have been said are the building blocks of both these elements, that by the end, they blossom themselves into something poetically but shatteringly beautiful; acknowledging of the broken humans living in a broken world, that these non-fiction characters are far from perfect, just like the rest of us.However, the dialogues may not be easily digestible for general audiences. If you're into science and history, you are at an advantage. If not, then these jargons and sometimes, poetic style dialogues would make your head spin. They are not friendly. Even when they did explain on quantum physics, it wasn't something that can be understood by everyone. We love the dialogues but to be safe, prepare a cup of coffee prior because this is one brain exercise film, the good kind, of course.If you're a Nolan fan, you'd know that plot twists are something he has in store for us. But did this biopic has one? Did Nolan take that risk? The risk that might jeopardize the authenticity of the story? Without revealing, we can say that the third act is very, very good. Something that most directors attempted but failed. However, Nolan did it naturally, the story unfolds excellently even with all the complexity that surrounds it. He did it smooth. Strong emotions were evoked, he left us something to ponder about. The experience was quite traumatic and he brought us along the journey to experience what it's like to be Oppenheimer. It is that good.This film is morally complex. It questions whether it's right or wrong. It questions whose side we are on. It delves deep and studies Mr. Oppenheimer and brings it along with us for the ride. Nolan was able to let us feel what he's feeling as if we're stepping in his shoes. Thought-provoking. Mind-wandering. Psychologists will have a great time in cinemas.A brilliant choice, Oppenheimer used both black-and-white and colour as it conveys different meanings with the former staying true to the real event that had happened in history with (mostly) exact dialogues, body language and circumstances powerfully acted mostly by Robert Downey and Alden Ehrenreich. The latter is used, to maximize its entertainment value while still maintains the actual events recorded in history. Not once we felt annoyed by the transition, it went well.Targeted for mass market, we felt this could have cut about 20-30 minutes short so that all audiences can enjoy. Although there was very little to none unnecessary scenes, we still strongly believe that Nolan could take out a few scenes. If this happened, the momentum and pacing would better for everyone. Also, the Trinity Test was purely excellent. The practical effects and sound designs were really executed well. The music score, composed by Ludwig Goransson, though not as masterpiece as Hans Zimmer, is breathtaking. It felt right with all the scenes, it elevates out immersive experience, it left us at the edge of our seats.Verdict: Hauntingly beautiful, Oppenheimer feels like a ticking time bomb as it evokes a strong visceral and immersive experience. Almost everything is done right, Christopher Nolan makes sure this film blows us away with a rich story, stark character studies, strong dialogues, powerful music score, impeccable acting amongst many others. While it is not Christopher Nolan's magnum opus, this is still one of his best ouevre in history."
"I was excited to see this film, but ended up feeling really disappointed. The overall structure is a convoluted mess. Nolan jumps around in the timeline with his narrative style, which was suited for Interstellar or Inception, but just makes a mess of story in a biopic about the father of the atomic bomb.Firstly, Is it worth seeing? Yes, but there's no reason to rush to the theater and watch in on the big screen. It's mostly a dialogue-driven film, and the big ""boom"" scene isn't impressive. It looks like they just blew up a big stack of dynamite and filmed it. Obviously they couldn't blow up a real nuke just to make a movie, and maybe CGI didn't look good. Either way, the bomb test scene, when it finally gets there, despite seeing it in IMAX, with booming speakers, was underwhelming.Much of the film focuses on the personality of J. Robert Oppenheimer as a flawed person, neither martyr nor warmonger. Cillian Murphy's portrayal is fantastic. However, the plot focuses heavily on the McCarthy-era interrogation he faced where he lost his security clearance, and was subsequently removed from the Atomic Energy Commission. Of course we also see the development of the atomic bomb, and various snippets of Oppenheimer the ""fellow traveler"" (those who were sympathetic to communist and left wing causes but never joined the party), Oppenheimer the womanizer who cheats on his wife, Oppenheimer the clumsy student who isn't as smart as his peers, and finally Oppenheimer the charismatic leader and of some of the most brilliant minds in the world working on the atomic bomb.The follow up to this is all having to do with a more obscure figure in history, named Lewis Strauss, potrayed by Robert Downey, jr. This is where the plot gets lost. Without knowing all the details of Strauss's involvement ahead of time, the whole witch-hunt trial was confusing and convoluted. This part of the story dragged on forever.Now, regarding the historical accuracy, there are lot of famous figures represented in this movie. It's true that Oppenheimer knew all these people, and all these world-famous physicists who, during this strange time in history, were as world reknown as rock stars and entrepreneurs are today. However, they barely say much, they just appear to have a few words while they point Oppenheimer to different people.I also found it odd that Nolan decided to include Einstein, but no mention of how he too was considered a fellow traveler and had more communist affiliations than Oppenheimer, and was briefly subject to some red scare vitriol.I also really questioned the historical accuracy of the whole thing in a particular scene where Oppenheimer is having a tryst with a communist portrayed by Florence Pugh. They start talking about Marx's Capital, how she's read all three volumes. He says ""possession is theft"" and she corrects him ""property is theft"" as supposedly a famous quote from the book. MASSIVE FACEPALM moment.Anyone with a modicum of knowledge about leftist history or Marx, would know that ""Property is Theft"" is a famous slogan from Pierre Joseph-Proudhon, an anarchist who Karl Marx once was friends with, but who he heavily criticized and basically tore apart in subsequent essay. Ever since the collapse of the first international, anarchists and Marxists have not seen eye to eye. No Marxist, let alone a CPUSA member in the 1930's, would be misquoting Marx with Proudhon. This was either a glaring oversight, OR deliberate trolling on the part of Nolan. I'm not sure.Either way, it brings into question the accuracy and the underlying message of the rest of the film. Nolan has included a lot of counter-revolutionary themes in his Dark Knight trilogy, and even hinted at being a closet Tory, so I don't trust him to portray Oppeheimer's saga accurately. I found a lot of similar issues with Aaron Sorkin's dreadful Lucille Ball biopoc. The idea of both films seems to be to ""rescue"" the legacy of these iconic figures by exorcising their communist flirtations as naïve youthful indiscretions. All the while ignoring the reasons why communism was so en vogue in the first half of the 20th century.There are a lot of other issues that I could talk about how general Leslie Groves, portrayed by Matt Damon, was made to look like a an gruff but affable ally and good friend of Oppenheimer. By some accounts, they were much more at odds with each other, and some even suspected Groves of being a fascist (people sometimes forget, with all the focus on communist witch hunts, how many fascists and Nazis were in the US at the same time, even in positions of power of prominence). Of course Groves pushed through Oppenheimers security clearance, not because he liked him, or even trusted him, but because he knew that he was their only chance of developing the a-bomb and beggars couldn't afford to play purity politics.Wait til this movie hits streaming to see it, and definitely read some books. Don't take these biopics at face value as real history."
"An interesting man to create a movie about and Cillian Murphy did great job portraying him, but obviously the main appeal of the story is how he created the atomic bomb. Did they show what went into that project? Sure, but it wasn't the main focus. The majority of the movie was much more about Oppenheimer's personal life, including his political views and relationship issues. I also didn't care for the way it kept jumping around in time, sort of like the recent Elvis movie. This creates a sense that you're watching a trailer for a movie, instead of a movie itself. If it was half as long and was more about the bomb, I would have rated it much higher."
"Oppenheimer isn't a biopic, it's a journey of questions through the eyes of one person, Nolan delivered an intellectual dilemma that leaves you thinking for a long time.The Acting is aces, everyone delivered a great performance, but yes Cillian is incredible and will get at least the Oscar nomination, Damon, Blunt are fantastic and RDJ is phenomenal, finally he gets to show his real talent in real movies!!!, a lot of cameos and boy I enjoyed everyone one, but Affleck and Malek will steal the show, Gary Oldman was superb too.The movie is long but you will not feel it, Nolan managed to tell the story in such a way you can enjoy it without losing focus or interest ( make sure to stay focused, everything you see at the beginning will be needed at the end ).Music is the key ""Actor"" in Nolan movies, same here, at some scenes that were just spectacular! Best of the year till now!The way Nolan shot the Trinity test was really smart, it wasn't about the blast itself but about humans, fantastic choice in my opinionThis is Cinema as I love, everything is about telling a story the best way possible, only a few directors can still do that nowadays. The end of the movie was just the beginning of another chapter and yes it leaves you asking a lot of questions!"
"This stands as one of the finest biography, drama film I've seen in recent years, truly a masterpiece crafted by Christopher Nolan.The screenplay is nothing short of remarkable, with clean and powerful lines effectively communicating even amidst numerous scientific terms.The cinematography is outstanding, leaving you feeling fortunate to have experienced it. Watching the film on IMAX is totally worth it.The cast delivered outstanding performances in this film. Cillian Murphy's performance, in particular, stands out as he portrays a complex and emotionally compelling role, capturing the moral dilemmas that Oppenheimer himself faced and those that resonate with us in today's age. His portrayal, facial and eye expressions add depth and authenticity to the character, making it truly impactful and thought-provoking. I won't be surprised if he wins 2024 Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading role."
"Is this the best movie Christopher Nolan ever made? I think so. This movie was a masterpiece. There wasn't a single scene I wanted to skip. I was too captivated by every part of this film. Cillian gives a performance that not only should bring him to his first Academy nomination but IMO should win him the whole thing. So did Downey. This was also the best performance by Emily Blunt I think ever. Matt Damon was fantastic, and Florence was too. Loved the small roles of 3 Academy Award winners with Affleck being terrifying with just a little screen time, Oldman being unrecognizable and Malek stealing the last 20 minutes of the film. Hoyte van Hoytema once again made fantastic cinematography one of his best and Ludwig Göransson ATE that score. I think it's one of the best scores in a film ever. Period! I have chills listening to those melodies even now. What a score.This film left a big impact on me and I wish Nolan and the crew all luck on award season. But I think that this is his moment."
"Will some think this is boring? For sure. Will some think it's too long? Undoubtedly. But overall I thought this was a very quality film like most of Christopher Nolan's movies, and while this one isn't my favorite it's still good for what it is. It's a JFK-like historical drama. The acting/cast were all incredible and so was the set design, and also the lack of CGI and special effects. The directing and camera work were awesome too. The middle part with them detonating the test bomb was a very well-constructed and tense scene. It was also intelligent in a way to only show the American perspective of the war and how out of touch/indifferent they were with the suffering that they inflicted on the Japanese civilian population, except of course for the main character. He was portrayed very well and this movie is coming out at a very critical time in history, reminding us of the destructive potential of escalating to nuclear war with other countries (no matter the side) and that our responsibility with handling weaponized nuclear technology is not to be taken lightly, and we must have a moral conscience. The movie also showed the quick/immediate development of a post-war McCarthyist government which was portrayed how it should have been. This is good and informative 20th century history!"
"Like Martin Scorsese and Alfred Hitchcock before him Christopher Nolan is one of the few directors who can guarantee a paying audience as surely as any of the big box-office draws in the acting profession. A film-maker of great skill he has nevertheless often eschewed 'seriousness' to work, if not necessarily in the 'popcorn' market, then certainly in the commercial field and that's where he has built up his following. But what will his followers think of ""Oppenheimer""? Will today's movie-going generation even know who J. Robert Oppenheimer was, (at the full-house screening I attended I saw two people leave), and can Nolan do justice to his subject?To that last question the answer is undoubtedly yes. As I say Nolan is a film-maker of great skill and ""Oppenheimer"" is unquestionably his best film to date. It's an old-school epic, three hours long, superbly shot on the biggest of canvases and with an all-star cast even if some of those Oscar-winning actors are reduced to cameos, (Gary Oldman as a devious Harry Truman). At its centre there's a terrific performance from Irish actor Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, chosen perhaps for his slight resemblance to the man but also because Nolan clearly saw in Murphy talents other of his screen roles never fully explored.Of course, in typical Nolan fashion the narrative isn't linear. The film may begin with Oppenheimer the Cambridge student and end with Oppenheimer the decorated old man but in-between Nolan skips back and forth in time, shooting both in colour and in black and white and framing his film around two sets of 'hearings', one in which Oppenheimer, late in his career, appears before a committee of three to see if his security clearance will be renewed, knowing that this is nothing more than a kangaroo court; the other, filmed in black and white, the much larger senate committee hearings set up to determine the suitability of Lewis Strauss to be U. S. Secretary of Commerce in Eisenhower's government and in this role Robert Downey Jr. Not only give the best performance of his career but should be a shoo-in for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. These scenes form the backbone of the film and may prove too talkative for Nolan's customary audience. That said, this is a beautifully composed and highly intelligent picture, clearly aimed at an adult audience. I wouldn't be at all surprised if it sweeps the boards at next year's Oscars."
"Oppenheimer (2023) is a movie that my wife and I saw in theaters tonight. The storyline follows a Princeton professor who is teaching a theory on a radical new science during World War II. The Germans and Japan are winning the war, and the arms race to build the next great bomb could tip the outcome. The scientist is asked to help the United States military create a bomb that could end the war. He will need to deal with the ethical aspects before, during and after the creation of the ask, as well as manage his personal life and political pressures.This movie is directed by Christopher Nolan (Tenet) and stars Cillian Murphy (28 Days Later), Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada), Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting), Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man), Florence Pugh (Midsommar), Casey Affleck (Gone Baby Gone), Rami Malek (Bohemian Rhapsody) and Gary Oldman (True Romance).This period piece is masterfully put together in every way. The storyline has depth, worthwhile subplots and dynamic characters. The cast is brilliantly selected and deliver tremendous performances - Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr are amazing. The cinematography was top notch and the lone action sequence was well executed, though some scenes of the bombings in Japan would have kicked it up a notch. I adored the depiction of all the scientists from this era. The ending twists and turns I never saw coming. This is worth every minute.Overall, this will be the best film of 2023 and is an absolute must see. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it."
"This is one of the most intriguing and astounding movies I have had the pleasure of seeing in my over 60 years of movie going. Yes, there are some impressive special effects, but they are truly the least impressive things here.First is the script. A GREAT deal of history is condensed into three hours of often quickly delivered dialogue. It is succinct, and it is often brilliantly structured. Flashbacks, flashforwards, jump cuts, etc. Not to impress, as was too often the case in Dunkirk, but to create an ever richer tapestry of historical events and tie them together. Definitely deserves an Oscar.Second is the directing. Getting all of this to flow, and often rush forward in an intelligent and cohesive way was an act, or many acts, of directorial genius. Nolan was nominated for a Best Director Oscar for Dunkirk, but didn't win. This time he should definitely win. His work bringing all this together is phenominal.The acting is all fine to very fine. It should definitely make a star out of Cillian Murphy, whom I had never heard of before but who does a fine job as Oppenheimer. Damon is good as Groves, though I suspect some of his dialogue was ""enhanced"" to make the character more interesting. I read Groves' book on the Manhattan project. He didn't come off as that blunt and forceful.The editing is also remarkable. I was especially impressed with some of the sound choices at crucial moments, such as the explosion of the test bomb. It keeps you on your toes and makes you think because it delivers the unexpected.This movie is 3 hours long. I was not bored for a single minute.My hat is off to Nolan. This is truly a work of genius."
"Disgrace. I feel sorry for the paper that carried these pointless rows of dialogue and the hard drives packed with nonsensical scenes.Did Scorsese get drunk at a party and claimed you're no good director if you make a movie less than 3hours long and now everybody is trying to live up to it?This could've been a short film packed with ambivalence, tention and regret - but it's just a diluted piece of propaganda meandering the dark hallways of Hollywood. Cilian did a decent job, but the rest of the leading cast is just cringeworthy.Can't even grade it, it was unwatchable til the end, left the movies and stared at the ceiling, it was more fun."
"It's taken me a few days to be able to sit down and write down my thoughts about Christoper Nolan's newest big screen epic, the other part of the now infamous ""Barbenheimer"" double bill that has been re-writing record books over there launch weekends, having had this time to ponder and contemplate I am confident in saying that I've never seen a film quite like this biopic and while it's a film with flaws and components that don't stick their respective landings, Nolan's film is nevertheless a powerful, poignant and technically marvellous piece of original film-making that further establishes the esteemed director as a generational talent whose skill set is unrivalled.It's incredible to think that a three hour dialogue heavy expose of a theoretical physicist and the creation of the worlds first atomic bomb could become a film that is being viewed on such a scale that Oppenheimer is currently playing too and while it's clearly been enhanced by the fact Nolan's heavy hitting drama has been partnered alongside the pink behemoth that's Barbie, there's also no denying that audiences are hungry for original content that gives them something more than just another run of the mill experience and that's exactly what Oppenheimer does.Told in a typical Nolan like fashion that refuses to play out in a manner that could said to be stereotypical, Oppenheimer operates in multiple timelines and requires audiences to pay close attention to who is who but despite covering immense ground and delving into far more than just Oppenheimer's past, present and future or the bomb he was responsible for bringing into existence, Nolan's film never becomes too complicated or overbearing as clever direction, editing and script work ensures that its three hour runtime will grip anyone willing to go along with it, creating an utterly engaging and even white knuckle experience that is the very definition of what cinema is all about.Lead by a long overdue and awards worthy turn from Cillian Murphy as the titular figure, who is ably supported by a string of A-listers that most notably includes key performances from the likes of Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's long-suffering wife Kitty, Matt Damon as military head honcho Leslie Groves and Robert Downey Jr. In a scene stealing performance as Lewis Strauss, Oppenheimer is all class on screen as Nolan juggles one of the most stacked ensemble casts of the modern era and while some of his big name performers might only get mere minutes of screentime, each and every one of them brings their A-game to what must surely be regarded as Nolan's most noteworthy feature yet based on performances.Outside of this aspect of Nolan's masterwork is the technical elements of this big budget affair that includes an unforgettable score by Ludwig Göransson, exemplary editing by Jennifer Lame, beautiful cinematography from the increasingly impressive Hoyte Van Hoytema and sound mixing/editing from Nolan's team that ensures despite the fact Oppenheimer is very much focused in on the people at the heart of the story, so much of the film still feels like a grand cinematic offering and there are moments within Nolan's opus that are likely to remain some of the most memorable cinematic moments of recent times, none more so than the breathtaking detonation test scene that left my particular screening as silent as a field mouse.I have no doubt that like many of Nolan's films in the past decade detractors and naysayers will turn their attention to singling out elements of Nolan's film that may be considered weak points and while there's going to be further debate about the sound mix of this film and Nolan's films as a whole, that at times have their dialogue drowned out by the score or other aspects of the mix or the debate that rages about Nolan's ability to connect on the human level, that is on show here with a strangely cold romantic element between Murphy and Blunt and also with Florence Pugh's Jean Tatlock (not due to performances, more so development) but allowing your gaze to be directed into these areas as a main point of focus is robbing one of the experience they could otherwise have.Building to a crescendo that is both surprising, haunting and unforgettable, it's unlikely that you will soon forget Oppenheimer, a beautifully staged biopic that is also so many other things all at once, where Oppenheimer ranks amongst all of Nolan's work will take some time to decide but what's undeniable is the fact Nolan has once more proved original film-making is alive and well, should one take the time and care to bring it too life.Final Say -A film that feels unlike any before it, Oppenheimer is a big screen epic that is both grand and intimate, thrilling and confronting and a further addition to the growing legacy of Christoper Nolan to be regarded as one of the most important voices in cinematic history.5 bowls of marbles out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
"A movie about life of Robert Oppenheimer, the focal scientist who helped bring to life the atomic bomb.This was the first movie this year to get me excited to go to back to the movies but this movie ultimately disappointed me in several ways. In the end the negatives outweighed the positives.The good:
Fantastic scoreGood acting overall, especially Cillian Murphy is great, so is Robert Downey JrExcellent cinematographyThe bad:
-Story feels disjointed, time jumps are excessive to the point that is dostracting
Movie tries to pack too much into theee hour runtime and doesn't get it's priorities right. It feels like a series of ""This happened and then that happened"" scenes and a collage of everything in his life. Several prominent characters get introduced in rapid succession and they are gone before you get to know them or to care in the slightest. On the other hand the movie dedicates too much time to things like the courtroom drama and sex scenesUnnecessary sex and nudity, with all the feminist movement these days and considering we're in 2023, we surely should not put sex acenes and nudity only for the sake of it but only if they add to the plot. Unfortunately in Openheimer's case they don't. We see absolute unnecessary sex and nudity in this film that serve no purpose.One last note, there is no reason to watch this movie in IMAX other than an underwhelming explosion scene that takes a maximum of 10 minutes.Despite being a Nolan fan, I have to give this one a 6 overall."
"First of all- they left out the science and the interesting problem solving when inventing the a-bomb.They focus on relationships, corrupt leaders, espionage and the communist paranoia. These subjects are covered in other movies - and seen several times before. I had hoped to watch something new.However, They partly succeeded covering Oppenheimers regrets and dilemmas creating the bomb.The epilogue- lasting about one hour - really doesn't make any sense and didn't add anything interesting to the story.The acting is however good, exception of ""Einstein"". The mix of sound, music and speech is sometimes disturbing- especially with bad sound quality at the cinema. This is the loudness war all over again.This movie is a disappointment and the available documentaries are far better."
"As expected this is a fantastic movie. Oppenheimer contain some of the best acting ever seen and the directing is simply amazing. The music score is stunning, the story brilliantly told, and there are barely any flaws. This is intelligent filmmaking of the highest order and come Oscar season this will win all but a few of those statues.With that said I am still only giving this a 8/10 and I have two very good reasons for it.The first reason I think many will agree with me on and that is the length of the movie and the dragged out scenes, dragged out storytelling. This is one of the few rare cases were a studio executive should have put is fot down, but instead Nolan was likely given free range. The movie clocks in at 3 hours, and you do feel those hours because although this is one of most brilliant movies of our time, there is also almost nothing going on. There is talking, reading of paper, brief discussion about physics, more talking, reading more paper, another brief discussion. Only occasionally interrupted by a sex scene or a political discussion whether communism or fascism is the worst ideology. With the exception of the first atomic bomb explosion scene, which is beyond amazing, beyond brilliant, but except that scene what I mention above is the movie. That is it.Yes, the character study of Oppenheimer is in the center and as such this is one of the best ever made, but his career and life is portrait by reading of paper, a brief discussion about physics, more talking, reading more paper, another brief discussion. This is a movie you can watch one time for the novelty, twice for its brilliance, but after that never again because it will simply get boring.The second reason this movie is not perfect is the background- and side characters. Emily Blunt's acting is almost bad, or her character is badly written, perhaps both? And Florence Pugh? Seriously? The ""council"" gentlemen and the other students, and almost everyone not having a prominent role, are all so much worse than the main cast that it shows. Murphy, Matt and Robert are all fantastic and put in the performance of their lives and as long as the focus are on them, what they do, say etc. This might be the best movie ever made. But as soon as someone else come into the picture the quality immediately sink to almost mediocre level.With those negatives out of the way I need to mention the Atomic bomb explosion scene again. That scene is heart stopping, the entire movie theatre went so silent and the awe moment is absolute classic, stunning. Filmmaking at its best.A 8/10 and I highly recommend. If you can overlook the not so great actors, and you do not mind the dragged out runtime you are likely to think this is the best movie ever made. It is not, but it is the top contender of the year for sure. At least until The Marvels show up."
"Oppenheimer is not solely based on the Trinity. It's entirely political drama. Just a reminder to the audience of how obsessed humans are with power and fame. Music is the true hero of Oppenheimer's film. Every highest point throughout the film causes enormous tension. Everyone did an excellent job. The visual grandeur of Trinity underwhelmed me, but the music helped to compensate. Nolan has once again demonstrated his ability to present a political drama. Where all of the mental state were handled flawlessly. Overall, a remarkable image and historical significance that should never be forgotten. The film will leave you speechless."
"This movie is one of the best movies of this year. I like C. Nolan. I also really liked this movie. The movie is told from Oppenheimer's point of view. I think it was fine. Some scientific topics were very difficult to understand for me. I think the bomb scene was good. I think the acting was very good. Cillian Murphy played the static, cold character very well. Robert Downey Jr. Played great too. I think tacting was generally so good. I think there were some boring scenes in the movie. There were scenes in the cinema where I started to sleep out of boredom. But overall, I think it deserves an ""8"" point. This movie is one of the best movies of this year. I like it. I also watched the other movie (pink movie) first. It was so good after that movie."
"Oppenheimer is an awe-inspiring masterpiece that captivates from start to finish. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction and Cillian Murphy's stunning portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer bring history to life with an intense and emotionally charged performance. The film's cinematography is breathtaking, seamlessly transporting the audience to the World War II era. The intricate storytelling delves into the complexities of Oppenheimer's life, showcasing his brilliance as a scientist and the moral dilemmas he faced during the creation of the atomic bomb. Thought-provoking and intellectually stimulating, Oppenheimer challenges viewers to reflect on the consequences of scientific discoveries. The supporting cast's performances are outstanding, adding depth and nuance to this profound narrative. In all aspects, Oppenheimer is a triumph that leaves a lasting impact, reminding us of the power of cinema to enlighten and inspire."
"Synopsis: Oppenheimer handles a huge project of the creation of the atomic bomb that leads to all kinds of consequences on his personal life and many others surrounding him. This leads him to be the father of the atomic bomb and ""the destroyer of worlds"" as he becomes one of the most important figures in history.Directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Cillian Murphy as Robert Oppenheimer himself in a lead role for the first time in a Nolan film, after being in most of his films. Cillian Murphy looks nothing like the real Robert Oppenheimer physically. Yet, Murphy is able to portray the famous figure in a role that would lead him to win an academy award easily. From facial expressions to Cillian Murphy's wide eyes that are capable of speaking without him having to say a word and how they also can express guilt, regret, sadness, confusion, and all sorts of feelings that Oppenheimer went through while completing the complex project of the atomic bomb. As well as, the support of the make up and hair design department, audience members are able to capture Oppenheimer in three different stages of his life, young version, middle aged version, and an older version of the character. After his role in The TV Show Peaky Blinders (2013 - 2022) as Thomas Shelby, his popularity grew and everyone sees him as Shelby. However, after watching this film, audience members will easily forget that and a new image will be created in everyone's head as him being Robert J Oppenheimer.Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss gives such a heavy and top tier acting role that his presence can be heavily felt on screen and in the events and the different stages that his character goes through. It is by far the second best acting role in the film after Cillian Murphy's, it is for Sure Oscar worthy for Best Supporting actor. Same thing will Cillian's image among fans, RDJ has the image of Tony Stark/ironMan in everyone's head. Everyone has gotten used to seeing him as that superhero who flies and shoots lasers from his hands. But, that image can e easily forgotten after watching this film. I am not denying every great thing he did for the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man as I am a huge fan of it. But, this film reminds everyone of who RDJ really is as the actor who is able to portray and put on some great acting skills and Oscar worthy performance like he used to before as Harry Lockhart in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005), Charles Chaplin in Chaplin (1992), or Paul Avery in Zodiac (2007).On the other hand, Matt Damon as Leslie Groves is the only role that added nothing to the table compared to everyone else's appearance. Even though he has a huge screen time and he plays an important role in the story, some other actors have less screen time than him and they did a better job. Like Rami Malek and Edward Teller.Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer, Rami Malek as David Hill, and Alden Ehrenreich as Senate Aide throughout the whole film, do not have a scene that would put the spotlight on them and make them noticeable until we reach towards the end in which all of them will have their time, their moment, and their scene to shine which what made those scenes very special specifically because of their acting skills.In addition, there are so many other actors that appeared in the film (some are a surprise) in which they all have some great scenes and great acting skills that will lead them to shine in their scene and I will refuse to mention them to avoid any spoilers and it would rather be better if you walk into this movie not knowing that they will make an appearance.The film deals with sound effects in the most amazing way especially in moments of silence whenever the film focuses on Oppenheimer's point of view and what goes through his head in terms of fear, regret and confusion like heavy breathing, screams or countdowns.On the other hand, the film's sound mixing is horrible to the point that it may holdback a viewer's experience and understanding of the events of the film due to the struggle of hearing the dialogue. It's either their voice can hardly be heard, or the music at most times is louder than the speech. This is not a first time for a Nolan film as films like Tenet (2020) and The Dark Knight (2012) have a very similar issue in terms of hearing the speech.Not to mention that the Music score - that was louder than the speech at most times - is greatly composed by Ludwig Göransson who returns again with Nolan as he composed Tenet (2020) in which the similarities can be heard between both Tenet (2020) and Oppenheimer (2023). There is a specific tone and vibe that Ludwig Göransson used in both films to deliver the film in the way it should be. However, many have surprisingly compared Ludwig Göransson's work in Oppenheimer (2023) to Hans Zimmer's work in previous Nolan films like in Interstellar (2014) by specifically comparing Ludwig Göransson's music piece ""Can You Hear the Music"" in Oppenheimer to Hans' ""S. T. A. Y"" in Interstellar (2014). In my opinion, this is a totally unfair compression as Ludwig Göransson's work is nothing compared to Hans' work. That does not mean that Ludwig Göransson work is not that good but I just think that comparing what Hans Zimmer did lowers Hans' work quality as well as Ludwig Göransson's work.When promoting the film, it is suggested that seeing it in IMAX 70MM is A MUST which hyped everything as expectations has risen that audience members will probably experience something similar to Interstellar when it comes to the visuals and the cinematography. Yet, most of the film is literally being shot indoors with no room for visually stunning shots to even be introduced and present because the film depends on dialogues in the first place.But, does that mean that seeing in IMAX 70MM was NOT worth it? NO
Does that mean that I DON'T recommend everyone to go see it in IMAX 70MM (the format it is suppose to be seen in)? NO
Because, how often do film directors release films that are shot using IMAX cameras and are offered in IMAX 70MM (film IMAX and not digital IMAX)? It's probably once every 2-3 years. Therefore, I do highly recommend anyone to see it in IMAX 70MM FILM for the full experience and I promise it won't disappoint and the next time a film will be offered in IMAX 70MM will provably be in 2 or 3 years. But, I really was hoping and expecting an Interstellar or Avatar (2009), type of cinematography.The story of Robert J Oppenheimer isn't as complicated as how it is being introduced in this film. But, isn't the way that Nolan introduced and made this whole biography film different, unique and more complicated than other biography films, is what truly makes Nolan a unique film director?This is the first time that Nolan does a biography/based on a true story type of film and Im more than glad that HE did it, because I'm 100% positive that any other filmmaker would've turned it into an ordinary, usual and typical biography film without including any complications or mind blowing twists like Christopher Nolan.My rating is 9.5/10 (MIGHT CHANGE ON 2ND VIEWING)

"Oppenheimer review :""I am become death; the destroyer of the worlds""; this particular Bhagvad Gita reference finds itself in the most unlikely moment in Christopher Nolan's latest cinematic spectacle called Oppenheimer, which is the name of the father of the atomic bomb. Knowing the genius of Nolan, he tells the the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer in his now patented ""non-linear""form with the all important Sanskrit phrase from the revered Hindu holy book forming part of a sex scene as well as the adrenaline rushing ""test"" of the atom bomb.The film is not just a simple biopic on the creator of the atom bomb but also a wonderful insight in to the political situation of the '40s, particularly the World War II. Oppenheimer is shown to be leftist inclined; an ideology which gets him embroiled in a litigation later. His relationship with his fellow scientists (particularly the great Albert Einstein) as well as his personal affairs with his wife (Emily Blunt) and girlfriend (Florence Pugh) are effectively shown.Quite verbose in its presentation with two parallel conversations leading to the climax, Oppenheimer is certainly not everyone's cup of tea, particularly if you are craving for just action and not dialogue heavy stuff. The actual bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki isn't shown as Nolan prefers concentrating on aftermath of the same. Oppenheimer's meeting with then POTUS Truman makes for a highly interesting scene. So is the climactic revelation about a certain crucial character.Technically, Nolan scores full marks yet again with an outstanding background score, awesome visual appeal and top notch production values expected from him.The cast is extraordinary and expectedly, Cillian Murphy delivers his best performance till date. Robert Downey Jr. Is the scene stealer as Lewis Strauss, the Chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). Matt Damon is also a standout as General Groves, the director of Manhattan Project. Rami Malek leaves a mark even in a cameo. The rest of the cast is also first rate.Oppenheimer may not match the level of Nolan's Inception (2010) or Interstellar (2014) but is way above the ordinary Hollywood stuff being served these days. Don't miss it in theatres!!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni."
"Nolan yet again proved that why he's one of the finest directors till date with 0 disappointing movies.. Oppenheimer is exceptional..! Brilliant at performance level..terrifying and horrifying tense music..highly convincing screenplay..terrific and beautiful visuals..dark and complex nature (not comparable toll to other Nolan classics)...
Literally Nolan itself - school of masterpiece arts ..
Oppenheimer is very great epic and non linear..It will sure shot very horrific movie not for every audience! If you are dying to watch pure drama portion oriented cinema, If you want to see some terrifying psychological brilliance and If you're fan of anyone who are involved in this film - Go For It!! Oppenheimer should remain forever until the drama school and making exist."
"""Oppenheimer"" by Christopher Nolan is a film that delves deep into the consequences of the atomic bomb, focusing on Oppenheimer's perspective. This film requires a genuine passion for physics or history to fully appreciate its subtleties and biographical content.The imagery of the various explosions, accompanied by carefully orchestrated music and sound effects, creates an intense visual and auditory experience. At times, they even evoke feelings of tension and stress, enhancing the viewer's immersion in the story.The performances by the actors are remarkable, especially Cillian Murphy's brilliant portrayal of Oppenheimer. His captivating and nuanced interpretation brings this complex character to life, while Matt Damon, in the role of General Groves, delivers a solid and convincing presence.The film skillfully explores different temporal tones, offering a non-linear narrative that adds an additional depth to the story. The smooth transitions between color and black-and-white sequences add an artistic and symbolic dimension to the overall experience. These aesthetic choices enhance the emotional impact of the narrative and clearly distinguish the different eras and events.It's worth noting that to fully appreciate this film, prior interest in the history of the atomic bomb, as well as Oppenheimer's life and work, is necessary. With a duration of three hours, the film may seem lengthy to those who are not invested in these specific subjects.The story is divided into three distinct parts, with the first two closely interconnected. The first part focuses on Oppenheimer's training as a physicist, highlighting his interactions with Heisenberg and other eminent scientists of the time. The second part centers around the creation of the atomic bomb, the tests conducted at Los Alamos, and the scientific challenges faced by the team. The final part of the film focuses on Oppenheimer's hearing, where certain high-ranking officials, envious of his accomplishments, attempt to discredit him by presenting him as a spy working for the Soviets.Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" is a film that delves deep into the history of the atomic bomb, offering remarkable performances, impressive visuals, and complex storytelling. It is an immersive cinematic experience that reveals the moral, scientific, and historical aspects of this pivotal event in our history.Special mention goes to the fantastic Gary Oldman, who is completely unrecognizable in the role of President Truman."
"With great expectations, I went to watch this film, and returned home totally disappointed. Very much shallow plotted with so many people to remember. I don't prefer watching this at theater. Many of us intended to leave in the middle while the movie was running. To me, it is a overhyped movie. However cinematography and casting were good. I expected better from Mr. Nolan. This movie could have ended within 1 hour and 20 minutes. At this point of time, movies should have had some points which will hook the audience. But I did not find anything like that in this movie. I should have watched Barbie instead. Nevertheless, best of luck."
"This movie, about one of the most significant events in the history of humanity effectively boils the entire story down to a very drawn out HR meeting to decide whether J. Robert gets his security clearance revoked or not many years after the event.Er... who cares?I understand that Nolan chose to focus on the man rather than the event, but I think this was a mistake. Three hour biopics can work (rarely), but this is no Schindler's List. It is more a kitchen sink drama where the majority of the characters are one dimensional (Downey Junior gives it his best shot though as always), and the eponymous central character is not particularly compelling. He's interesting in a clinical kind of way but emotionally engaging, no. Despite a strong performance from Murphy, I simply didn't care much about the man.As a result of this focus there is little to be seen of the immense scientific endeavour of the Manhattan Project (the biggest ever at that point in history until the Apollo Programme), and there isn't much about the physics either. There could have been some real dramatic tension over the perceived race against the Nazis to develop an atomic weapon, but this is only referred to a couple of times in throwaway lines.Matt Damon is functional, and we get to learn that Robert himself was a bit of a serial shagger (that was a surprise), but again, so what? Oh, he did shag a lady who was a member of the communist party, so he might be tarred by the same brush. Or he might not. That is not a big enough tension to sustain a three hour movie.The Trinity test is very well done. I have no quibbles about how that is realised, but again so much of the true story of how a team of four thousand scientists laboured for three years to achieve it is simply ignored.The pacing is extremely uneven. A caption announces at the beginning '1. Fission'. Aha, I thought, it is in three acts. But there was no caption for 2 or 3. Perhaps the editor just forgot to put them in. May I suggest for a director's cut that these are '2. Boom!' and '3. The HR Panel Interview Concludes'.Flabby, unfocused and really a bit dull. It could have been so much more, in so much less time."
"Oppenheimer was a C-.Solid lighting, production design, and great cast. That's about it.It is yet another Christopher Nolan film with an overly-dramatic score to let the audience know how profound he is being. He also has never met an editor he likes. The film is way, way too long. A meandering plot and a last act that is spliced together like a 1980s MTV music video. Outside the lighting, which was good, the cinematography was poor with unimaginative framing and very little use of creative angles or motion. I think Nolan thinks that the IMAX format somehow automatically makes the cinematography special and artistic and he single-handily proves that notion wrong with this film (as well as Dunkirk).Nonetheless, it will find its way into a nomination/and or for Best Picture because of the emperor's new clothes."
"This movie is easily one of the best films this century yet despite that it gets called ""boring"" because it doesn't have action sequences in the film. It seems like most people seen this because of the whole barbenheimer trend and not for the story about Robert J Oppenheimer. Calling this the most boring movie ever is crazy. And calling it confusing is understandable but if you paid attention to what they were saying you would understand the timelines. It isn't the atomic bomb movie it's the movie about the physicist Oppenheimer. We need more films like this cause the same mcu bs is making everybody think mid movies are cinema nah this is cinema sorry not sorry."
"I struggled a little bit - I mean it is the obvious pun (that as always is not intended - never ever, yes?), so should I take the easy one? Well as you can see: I did. There were a few others I considered yesterday ... but none that really would have ... the impact of this one (yes I can't stop - like Oppenheimer himself maybe?) ... one if you are really that curious involved Asteroid City - not just because they came out this year - you also had many talented actors in it and a setting in the desert. Although it was mainly desert for AC and only partly for Oppenheimer of course.Not to mention many more differences - anyway let's not waste more time on that. And time you'll need, because this is a 3 hour affair! Still and even while I once looked on my watch (2 hours in), I was never bored or annoyed by the running time. While we know Nolan knows his stuff technically - sometimes some viewers may have issues with the story. Now depending on your knowledge of history, you may find certain things interesting and others less so.Apparently there is one huge ""mistake"" with flags being from a different era (decade) than the one they are used in. Since it is done in color (something Nolan admitted would be a subjective telling of happenings), that might have been on purpose. But small things like that should not deter you from liking or disliking the movie. A friend also pointed out that a spy related ""fact"" was not entirely accurate. Using """" in both instances to make clear I am not saying it is so ... kind of like Christopher Nolan you say? Well thank you so much.As already mentioned, the movie has colored and black and white segments. The latter being the ones that are supposed to be historically accurate. I can't vouce for total authenticity - and the movie may bring up questions you may want to research. Be it certain people or incidents. Oppenheimer - this is as close as we'll get to know or rather see him. From a safe distance - same goes for the ... bomb (yes another pun).The actors are amazing, though it felt that Emily Blunt was underused at first. Not knowing the real wife of Oppenheimer, I imagined that was just the way she was. But behold she will get her time to shine and be more than a two dimensional character. Another character in Nolan films is his editing style and his insistence not to use CGI - which is quite impressive. Even more so here ... all the stuff that is ... well even the small stuff you see on screen here. There are so many visual treats that I am amazed he did practical ... and there is even more to discover.Even without being a scientist you can easily follow the main theme of the movie. You will not get a lecture (again sorry and you're welcome) ... well not a full one at least. Even if you are not down with the movies theme - you can't deny the sheer power that Nolan releases (well Oppenheimer in that case - although even he didn't do it all by himself - he surrounded himself with the best people he could - kind of like Nolan? Well if you say so) ... and with that I say til next time - chances hopefully are way better than near zero you like my review."
For me this movies is the best movie in this decade and one of the best nolan movie ever seen and one of the best movies of the all time actually this movis is top 5 movie I ever seen cillian is the best and deserve oscar and oppenhimer deserve oscar for best picture and cinematography and music and moreRobert downey jr deserve oscar for best supporting actor and also matt damon is one of the best I only say this movie is masterpiece and nolan should win oscar for the best director in this year and he deserve and florence pugh deserves oscar for the best actress in this year I love this movie I won't see this movie againThank you for reading.
"Cillian Murphy's greatest performance yet and another masterpiece by Christopher Nolan. Oscars worthy.Highly recommend although i recommend you give it your full attention when watching otherwise you might miss key elements. But if you've seen Nolan's other films, then you are familiar with his way of portraying timelines.The casting in this was perfect and everyone delivered above and beyond.Also, the way Nolan illustrated Oppenheimer's feelings and emotions was so clever and powerful.The 3 hours flew by. I was entertained and kept engaged throughout the entire film.A terrifying and important event in history beautifully visualized in this film."
"THIS IS CINEMA!!!An outstanding achievement in filmmaking and in cinematic world.Ridiculously impressive achievement for Christopher Nolan!A powerful story and phenomenal CAST!Cillian murphy can sleep in peace knowing he's getting that Oscar nomination for best actor!Cinematography is absolutely insane!The Soundtracks made me get goosebumps every single second!Literally once in a lifetime experience in cinema!Perfectly written script

"My goodness, what a disturbing film. I found the first hour to be very slow and a bit hard to follow. I definitely want to give it a second look so I can obtain a clearer understanding of all the different characters and moving parts. But once the intensity begins, it does not let up and it builds and builds and builds until the breathtaking conclusion.I am so grateful that I didn't watch this with my elderly parents as there is some nudity and a couple of unexpected sex scenes within the first half. But I must admit, seeing Florence Pugh naked did not suck.I was quite surprised by the performance of Robert Downey Jr. He plays a wicked dude and plays him very, very well. So convincing. Bravo performance, perhaps his best??Cillian Murphy, my dog. He was stunning. How he could transform into Oppenheimer and capture his conscience and internal struggle the way he did. Just wow, I felt all of that. It was heavy on the soul. When the film ended I literally gasped.Christoper Nolan, simply genius. He created a film here that rocked me to my core. It excites me to know that he is just in his early 50's and has many projects ahead of him 🤞 He is a rare gem in Hollywood.We completed Barbenheimer today. We started with Oppenheimer and then it was on to Barbie. I recommend that order if you decide to go through with it. In Opp you contemplate the terrifying darkness we humans are capable of. It is true horror and an all to real and unsettling look into our nature. Barbie is a fun little movie with some surprising depth. There were some profound moments where Barbie marvels at the beauty that is present within humanity. Kind of healing and balances things out nicely. What an interesting time in cinema!"
"In Nolan's filmography, which very few directors in history can rival, OPPENHEIMER possibly stands out as the best, and certainly most pure form of cinema. Give Cillian Murphy the Oscar NOW.Let me preface this by saying, I don't think this movie is for everyone. It's not your usual Nolan suspense/thriller blockbuster movie, and I feel like a lot of people who gave it negative reviews went into this movie with Interstellar/Inception/The Dark Knight type expectations. This is not a movie about The Atomic Bomb or The Manhattan Project. It's called OPPENHEIMER for a reason. And for others, it just may not be their cup of tea, which is totally fine. Maybe the subject matter isn't that gripping to them, or maybe the big science/political terminologies turned them off.Regardless, I find this movie to be one of the best cinema experiences I have ever had. I myself am not a big student of history, but this movie is crafted in such a brilliant way that it's hard to keep your eyes off the screen. 3 hours flew by so quickly, and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. The acting by everyone was superb, but special shouts need to be given to Cillian Murphy, who really should win the Best Lead Actor Oscar, and RDJ who most definitely will be nominated for the Best Supporting Actor. Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Matt Damon too were outstanding.Prior to me watching the film, I browsed the reviews and many said that the ""courtroom drama"" that follows the Trinity test is a bit boring, but honest to God I feel like that was the best part of the movie, or atleast as good as what came before. It flows seamlessly, and the tension between the characters is palpable. It tugs at your emotions and really does a fantastic job of putting the audience in the mind and heart of Oppenheimer.Visually, this movie is jaw-dropping, especially coupled with the fact that there are exactly 0 CGI shots. It's a ridiculous feat of filmmaking that only Nolan could do. The build-up to the Trinity test will have your heart in your mouth throughout, and the eventual release is terrifyingly beautiful.However I do have one teeny tiny criticism - towards the middle of the movie I felt like we were jumping from scene to scene way too quick, and at times it was slightly tough to keep track. I know this was purposely done in a bid to ramp up the tension (which it did!), but I felt it could have been paced slightly better.And the ending. OH MY GOD THE ENDING. Towards the end I was so curious as to how this movie ends, and holy balls Nolan really hit the mark - it ties the whole story together poetically. Such a beautiful way to go out.A masterpiece by every definition of the word. Quite possibly Nolan's best work.10/10."
"The life and times of J. Robert Oppenheimer.This is an intense and thought-provoking portrayal of one of the most influential people in history. Much of it is about the demons he carried for developing such a destructive power, and the politics involved in his rise and fall. All of this unfolds in a compelling way. It includes numerous great scenes of dialogue, brilliantly acted by the likes of Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr.The scenes detailing the Manhattan Project are wonderfully constructed with outstanding set design and an incredibly effective reconstruction of the Trinity Test. Do not expect too much scientific detail about quantum physics, nuclear reactions and how the bomb works, as the film focuses more on Oppenheimer's role as a driving force to get it done, his relationship with other key players, his personal life, and the fallout of how he conducted himself during the project and other moments of his career.Visually it is generally fantastic as you would expect from Christopher Nolan, who uses a number of striking images to portray the mental state of the lead character at various points of the story. Plus the sound effects are suitably jarring during shock moments. Oppenheimer gives a victory speech to a crowd at one point when the implications of his actions start to overwhelm him and this is immensely well done.Some moments (Einstein) feel like they are given artistic licence for cinematic reasons, but as long as you research what is fact and what is fiction, alongside watching the movie, you should be better informed. In fact, I would say it is essential that you get background information about certain individuals before seeing the movie, particularly Lewis Strauss, as it will provide context around certain scenes.For me it's a 9.5/10, but I round upwards."
"The movie is well directed but somehow the topic seems completely irrelevant. Robert Oppenheimer no doubt did a miracle (biggest curse on mankind, actually) by inventing atomic bomb but do we really require movie on legal events unfolding after the bombing event. Don't think these legal tangles and all are so important in course of history that movie is made out of it. The movies is unnecessarily 3 hours long and sometimes it feels that there is no point in knowing so insignificant events which happened post bombing event. Rather more focus on bomb invention and events leading bomb invention would have been an interesting event.I am perplexed to see so many high reviews about the movie. But I find it pretty average and one would not miss anything in life if he or she skips this movie.What I feel Mr. Chirstopher Nolan is losing its streak actually. Nolan was one of my favourite story teller but with every passing movie I am losing interest in his movies. Batman, Inception, Interstellar were absolute marvels and all time favourites of mine. But then Dunkrik, Tenet and Oppenheimer happend and I feeling his losing his touch on path breaking genre of movies. I feel less and less inclined now a days to watch his movies precisely because of dull topics he selects for story telling. He needs to reinvent himself now and come out with something unique and interesting. He needs to set bar higher than Interstellar."
"I studied Quantum Physics and I knew Oppenheimer biography before watching this movie so expectations were high. Unfortunately, full 3 hours do not make this much better than trailer - I learned nothing new. Outstanding acting from Cillian Murphy and RDJ, Emily was just blunt, so was Matt Damon's performance. Soundtrack is mediocre although delayed explosion sound made few people jump from their seats. Bomb making is virtually non-existent and there is a a lot of chat in the film, typical for a documentary. If you are late 1 hour for cinema screening, you won't miss anything it is that bad. I probably will never watch this again."
"""Oppenheimer"" is a smarter, more skilled and more serious film than any previous film by the talented Nolan could have led us to expect. It is at once an almost unrivaled biopic, a revealing historical document and a wake up call of gravest importance. As biopic it evokes the vividness of scene and ambiguity of protagonist portrait of the ultimately fictional ""Citizen Kane,"" and even some of that film's wit. As historical document it has the factual specificity of ""All the President's Men."" As historical document it packs the essay-like messaging and dramatic tension of ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"" with comparable virtuosity and stronger final emotional and intellectual impacts."
"So much has been written here about the brilliance of Cillian Murphy and the ensemble cast, about the cinematography, editing, sound track. And I concur it is a brilliant move on those fronts though a tad too long and heavy in lengthy dialogues in early stages.. However for me the move is incredibly important for bringing to the fore a turning point in the modern human civilization. Ability of humankind to destroy itself without needing any interstellar objects is a haunting prospect and this could be via nuclear weapons or via a more contemporary advances in AI.. The youth and future generations would be well served by watching this movie and being awakened to the destructive possibilities. In 1945, there was arguably a greater horror in the form of Hitler and fascists. Today there are horrors and evil forces but none that pervasive and so we are better served to unite in the thinking and philosophy towards the development and use of weapons of mass destruction.. Before I close off, I am a big fan of Cillian Murphy since Peaky Blinders and there is no better person to have essayed this fascinating character and genius. Watch the movie and make a note to watch it again to learn more .."
"As a devoted fan of historical dramas, I can confidently say that ""Oppenheimer"" is an absolute masterpiece! Christopher Nolan has once again delivered an awe-inspiring cinematic experience that leaves the audience spellbound from start to finish.Casting Cillian Murphy as Robert Oppenheimer was a stroke of genius. His portrayal of the conflicted scientist was both nuanced and emotionally charged. He brilliantly captured Oppenheimer's intellect, determination, and moral dilemmas, making the character come alive on the screen. Murphy delivers an Oscar-worthy performance. Also, Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss did an excellent performance. This is by far Downey's best performance, and he also deserves an Oscar nomination. The supporting cast is equally praiseworthy, with outstanding performances from Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and Florence Pugh.From the first frame, the film immerses its audience in a spellbinding narrative that perfectly balances historical accuracy and captivating storytelling. The attention to detail in depicting the era is unparalleled, transporting viewers back to the 1940s and the intensity of the Manhattan Project. The meticulous recreation of the Los Alamos laboratory and the wartime atmosphere adds an authentic touch, making the viewers feel like eyewitnesses to a defining moment in history.The cinematography deserves special commendation, as it brilliantly captures both the beauty of the New Mexico landscape and the intensity of the laboratory's scientific endeavor. The haunting musical score adds an extra layer of depth, heightening the emotional impact of critical moments throughout the movie.""Oppenheimer"" stands as a testament to the power of cinema to educate, entertain, and provoke introspection. It expertly delves into the complex interplay of science, politics, and human morality, reminding the profound implications that scientific discoveries can have on the world.Christopher Nolan has once again proven why he is one of the greatest directors of our time. Brilliantly written, impeccably directed, and expertly performed, the film leaves an indelible impression that will stay with viewers long after leaving the theater."
"Murphy is an exceptional actor, in the movie he was amazing and helped the actors with him to do their best, The sound effects of the movie is one of the best of all time especially in I-MAX theater, the bombing scene was masterpiece, and of course we know that bombing scene was masterpiece, but the closure scene! Oppenheimer talking to Einstein about the chain reaction they thought it will happen when bombing the nuclear bomb and cause the burning of atmosphere and all the world with it this of course didn't happen, but Oppenheimer realized that he already started it inventing the nuclear bomb knowing that all countries will race to have as many nuclear bomb and even advanced on as they can, and imagining that someday they will start a nuclear war that will destroy all the world. This is a scene that i think i'll never forget for all my lifetime
Overall the film is perfection, everyone did his job in perfect way, and i think cillian finally can has his Oscar award."
"Fanf***ingtastic! From start to finish. Absolutely loved every second of this incredible movie! Runtime clocks in at 3 hours but it went by very smoothly because there is so much going on. For those wondering, yes you can just dive right in. There's nothing you need to watch to understand what is going on. In fact, other than my time in school the only other times I've heard of any of the scientists in this movie were from the times they were mentioned on the popular tv sitcom The Big Bang Theory. Nolan is one of my favorite directors. His storytelling style may not be for everyone. So far I've loved each of his movies. Nolan joins a very short list of Directors that I don't need a bunch of anything to get me to watch their next story. Nolan has a very unique way in how he presents to you his stories. This one is no different. This movie is shot beautifully, and the practical set in Los Alamos really brought the scenes to life. It is amazing that Nolan was able to do all of this with the use of practical effects and little to no CGI. Let's talk about the music. The music adds elements of horror and intensity throughout. As a matter of fact, throughout the movie my Apple Watch kept going off because my heart rate had spiked high. That's how intense certain scenes got. Every actor in this movie brought their A game. There was such a great balance between all of them. I did like how a little bit of the movie felt like Seven Samurai and this is shown in the Trailer where Oppenheimer and General Groves go out and start recruiting scientists for this amazing, impossible task. I saw this movie in Dolby. Last time Nolan had a movie out I watched it in every format because I couldn't get enough and Oppenheimer is going to be no different. I look forward to watching this in IMAX once I'm able to get a seat. Great flick!"
"This movie gets better the longer you think about it. Everything about the movie is so well done, especially Cillian Murphy's stunning portrayal of Oppenheimer as he realizes what he has done to humanity. The Trinity Test scene was perfectly well done, no horror movie has ever made my heart beat as much as that scene did. Seeing Strauss turn against Oppenheimer was super interesting (RDJ did amazing as him as well). The entire hearing act did a good job at showing how the different motives against Oppenheimer resulted in his downfall. The final scene of the movie is one of the most perfect scenes of any film i've ever seen. Strauss was trying to understand what Oppenheimer said to Einstein that day (assuming it was something to push Einstein against him), but it ended up being something so much more deep. The way the last scene was done was just so chilling and thought provoking, it will stick with you for days after watching it."
"That you Mr Christopher Nolan for your effort with this fantastic film. You exceeded my already very high expectations - I've been anticipating this film for over six months. Thank you for choosing a fantastic cast to present such a masterpiece. The visual and auditory experience is something I want to experience again, particularly when it's still available in the premium cinemas.I went with a friend that told me they prefer movies to only be about 100 minutes long as he can get fidgety. I am grateful to say that they said that the 3 hours was very enjoyable and didn't feel long at all. In contrast, I admit I was disappointed it wasn't longer :-) but maybe I'm odd in that when I'm watching a great film then I'm happy for it to continue.Do yourself a favor, watch the movie at least once, ideally in a good cinema or at least a way to try to experience the audio and video as best you can."
"Oppenheimer is the best movie of the year!It's dense yet never lost me. Although most of the scenes are confronting people, its human-rigor never diminishes. In a way, telling a story like this is one of the boldest decisions any filmmaker, production house could make, for how radical the approach is, with no room for 'assumptions', 'cinematic liberties'.This is one of the fewest times a filmmaker took me into the head of a real-life character who did have real-world consequences of their actions.. that too on a catastrophic scale.The performances are the key here. This movie has some of the most remarkable screen-acting ever in the history! Yes, true.. No exaggeration. Every actor has lived those characters literally.Nolan's structure of telling this story is impeccably commendable. It's dialogue-heavy (as opposed to another 'serious' one - Dunkirk). And No.. it's not social network!But the dialogues are like bullets sometimes and some other times, those subtle whispers that almost sound like mind-voice of Oppy.I sat in the hall several minutes numbed by the film's impact on my senses and psyche.. It hit me very very hard.Nolan - Thank you for making films the way you do. May the courage be with you always."
"I have to admit: Oppenheimer didn't live up to the hype for me. This is not a bad film per se and while it depicts a frightening turning point in history, its style didn't suit me.Overall I think it's too densely packed and there isn't a payoff for the 3-hour runtime. I didn't feel emotionally connected to any of the characters because they are underdeveloped. There are different timelines, subjects and characters that get introduced and are gone before we get to known or care for them. Plus, the movie is overly dialogue-heavy and politically oriented for its own good. I enjoy engaging conversations but it's filled with technical dialogue, hearings and bureaucracy, which doesn't work for me. I might as well read a book or a Wikipedia page.I will, however, praise the acting of the entire cast and the immersive score and sound design. I wish I could say the same about the visual effects but I found what we were presented underwhelming."
"I find Christopher Nolan's films very hit and miss, nevertheless I'm still drawn to the cinema in the hope the latest release will be akin to one of my Nolan favourites.Oppenheimer unfortunately for me was a bit of a miss.I could appreciate this was a good biopic to cast on the big screen, however my thinking throughout was this could be better served over a longer series format. Multiple sections of the movie seem skirted over for me and would have been better served going into greater depth, that's even with this being a 3 hours in length.There was a number of characters that were lost in the dialogue, which can be tricky to stick with if you don't have a predisposition to quantum physics. Many character names were quoted and I was scrambling on many occasion to remember which man in the suit and glasses they were referring to, there seemed to be so many of them!Acting performances were solid, which I would expect with the stellar cast on show in this movie.I'd say give it a watch and make your own judgement, but what was one of my more anticipated movies of 2023, I can confidently say won't be one of the standout releases of the year for me."

The ratings for Barbie are from an alternate Universe based on a some unreal story.I would suggest that word of mouth vs IMDB is a better source rating for the quality of a good production based on these two movies released on the same weekend."
"Christopher Nolan does not do anything small, he's a big picture film maker, both in style and theme, in every way, and he brings all of his skills to bear in OPPENHEIMER, his three hour biopic of the man who oversaw the construction of the atomic bomb that ended World War II and then found himself at the center of the contentious politics that followed that conflict. At first glance, the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer would appear to be a tough sell to modern audiences used to the super heroics of the MCU and the DCEU, or franchises like JOHN WICK, THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS, and MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, but Nolan pulls it off not by pandering to the so-called ""modern audience,"" but instead treating them like adults and giving them a cinematic experience which rewards patience and investment.The screenplay by Nolan covers Oppenheimer's prewar years as a brilliant student in Britain and Germany, then as a professor at UC Berkeley, the World War II years with the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, New Mexico, culminating in the successful detonation of the A-Bomb in July of 1945, followed by its use against Japan to end the war. The last section concerns the aftermath as the Cold War rages and Oppenheimer's opposition to the further development of nuclear weapons, specifically the hydrogen bomb, brought him into conflict with powerful men in Washington who retaliated by destroying his reputation. Of course this is not a smooth linear narration, as the film jumps forward at times, and then circles back to put events in perspective and give a fuller picture of what was at stake, and to illuminate the motives of certain historical characters. Much of this action is dialogue driven, with lots of scenes of men sitting at tables and talking, but to Nolan's credit, the pace never lags, and he resists the temptation to explain the dense physics involved. His script is filled with a lot of historical personages played by a huge cast, many of whom have worked with Nolan before: Cillian Murphy in the title role; Emily Blunt as his wife, Kitty; Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock (the Communist Party member with whom Oppenheimer had an affair); Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves; Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss; Kenneth Branagh as Niels Borh; Tom Conti as Albert Einstein; Josh Hartnett as Ernest Lawrence; David Krumholtz as Isidor Rabi; Matthew Modine as Vannevar Bush; Gary Oldman as Harry Truman; James Remar as Henry Stimson; Dane DeHaan as Kenneth Nichols; Casey Affleck as Boris Pash; Jack Quaid as Richard Feynman; Benny Safdie as Edward Teller; Rami Malek as David Hill; Jason Clarke as Roger Robb; Tony Goldwyn as Gordon Gray, and with appearances by Josh Peck, David Dastmalchain, Alex Wolff, and Alden Ehrenreich, who really stands out as a Senate aide who figures a few things out. It says something that many of these actors have only a few minutes of screen time, but Nolan was still able to snag them. It also says something about the script that if you don't know who their characters are, and why they were important, the screenplay does a very good job of conveying why they matter to the narrative.Murphy is superb in the title part, perfectly capturing the great self-confidence of his character in his early years and later as head of the Manhattan Project, but I think Murphy really shines when the guilt at having helped usher in the atomic age takes hold of his character. The later Oppenheimer is a gaunt and haunted figure, and Murphy accomplishes much of this simply with a facial expression or body language. Two other standout performances are by Damon, whose General Groves perfectly captures the hard-driving can do spirit of the military during the war, and RDJ, who makes us totally forget Tony Stark in his portrayal of Lewis Strauss, a self-important insider who ultimately becomes Oppenheimer's nemesis after the war. This reminds us what a powerhouse dramatic actor RDJ really can be. Can't say enough about the cinematography by Hoyte de Hoytema and the score by Ludwig Goransson, and the practical effects during the testing of the Trinity bomb at Los Alamos, which is the dramatic highlight of the film, is far more impactful than anything CGI could produce; this sequence, which comes at the end of the second hour, is what the film has been building to and casts a long shadow over the remaining third.Though Nolan's sympathy clearly does lie with his title character, he does not shy away from the man's faults, he was an unfaithful husband, and possessed more than a little of the overweening self-confidence, even hubris, found in many a brilliant mind. He proved to be a poor communicator for his views of how nuclear weapons should be controlled after the war, and may well have welcomed the investigation by the Atomic Energy Commission, which ended in him being labeled a ""security risk"" for his past associations with known Communists, as a fitting punishment for his work in the development of the bomb. But Nolan deftly and subtly draws a contrast between Oppenheimer and Strauss, the former being a consequential figure because of his accomplishments, and the latter being a self-important and petty man desiring of a greatness that he cannot achieve. I think Nolan handles the complex politics of the era well, covering everything from the American Communist Party's staunch support for the losing side in the Spanish Civil War to the McCarthy era witch hunts. And this is one historical film that stays very far from the simplistic ""woke"" view of history itself. It will certainly reignite the long simmering debate over whether the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were the right thing to do. Some are already knocking the film because there is no depiction of the destruction the bombs wrought in Japan. It's funny how those who are quick to excoriate Oppenheimer, Truman and the other Americans for their role in the dropping of the bombs, never seem to have the same indignation for the leaders of Japan who launched the war in the first place, and then demanded that their people fight on and suffer unimaginable losses after they had clearly lost the war. And what did they think would have happened if Hitler had developed such a weapon? That was the very real fear that drove Oppenheimer, Einstein, and all the others in America who pushed to make this terrible weapon a reality.In the end, I think OPPENHEIMER is a legit contender for being Nolan's best film, at the very least I wasn't scratching my head when it was over unlike TENET. It has a thoughtfulness and intelligence one rarely sees in a major Hollywood production these days and solidifies my opinion that Christopher Nolan is the 21st Century successor to Stanley Kubrick. It's also a great piece of film making, and one that all true lovers of the art form should seek out."
"To make a movie of this standard on a 100 million dollar budget is a significant achievement by a modern filmmaker. For 180 minutes, Oppenheimer narrates a single story and opens up multiple themes like a flower blooming. It is vivid but not obvious, there lies the success of the movie.Nolan follows the same narrative style of Dunkirk, he doesn't show the enemy or the victims but makes us understand the horror through mere sound and imaginations. It is often said that ghosts are scary when they are felt more than they are seen and Nolan attests this statement. The movie goes back and forth with flashbacks in a nonlinear narrative structure, the trademark Nolan style at thos point. But this time the story is connected by a clear set of dots.The Manhattan Project is a very tough story to sell in the commercial space without compromising anti-war and nuclear disarment ideals. To blend in commercial elements in a politically significant storyline is no easy task today and this is the biggest success of Oppenheimer. The movie doesn't read like a Wikipedia page and doesn't use excess prosthetics for the sake of ""transformation"". The actors are well talented in this ensemble and there is a clear trust for their style.While Cilian Murphy is undoubtedly the star of the show, it was Robert Downey Jr who gets the best role of his career. For years he was underutilized in the performance department and was purely used as a mould for the MCU, it is refreshing to see him unleash his acting prowess. While the technical departments are getting their rightful praise, it is the makeup and hairstyling which caught my eye here. Impressive and simple work to create aging, which many fail to grasp."
"The movie delivers more than i even expected.It's Nolan masterpiece.The story telling was so good and dialogue was so full of emotions and informations about this real life god ( Oppenheimer).The cast was so perfect everyone of ghem did their role so good.Cillian Murphy, Emily blunt, Robert Downey Jr & Florence pugh. And and great Rami Malek and many many others were so perfect.The way they act made me fee like the were the real characters they were representing.Music was from another world flowing through the movie perfectly.The filmmaking was impressive and amazing and the pics & the places we discovered in this movie made me fall in love even more.3 hours felt like 3 mins.This is FILMMAKING in it is PEAK.If Christopher Nolan can't get Oscar on this i really don't know if Oscar really matter if Oppenheimer got dismissed from Oscar as the movie deserves many Oscar prizes for sure.I'm happy i got first release in my country in IMAX.10/10 for me."
"I watched this movie in IMAX 70mm and what an experience it was! What Christopher Nolan was able to create here was something truly special. The performances from the whole cast is outstanding every actor and actress deserves an Oscar. Especially Cilian Murphy as Oppenheimer, he is so and committed to the role. Another stand out performance is Robert Downey Junior, it shows that he's not just iron man. The dialogue is so gripping and you feel so invested in the story that is being told. The scene when they actually detonate the bomb was spectacular. The way the film ends leaves you walking out scared of the world we live in."
"I don't know where to begin. This movie was just so intense. Like every Nolan movie, it has completely enveloped my mind. I'm obsessed with it. It's haunting me.In many ways, it's a big departure for Nolan. Normally his movies have a lot of action, crazy stunts, far out sci-fi plots and most of them are fictional. Even Memento had more action and violence than this. Dunkirk was based on real events in WWII but it barely had any dialogue and was more of an experience, an action/suspense/thriller ride.Oppenheimer truly is a biopic, all about a man and his life. It doesn't try so much to give an objective overall assessment. It feels very personal. It captures the intensity of life. When you reflect over your years and realise the big things which stay with you. Other movies feel so trivial compared to this.The acting is incredible, one of the most impressive casts of all time, mostly male but that's a reflection of the reality. Cillian is great. So many understated and incredibly talented actors seem to come from the UK and Ireland. Oldman is great as well in his brief role - when I saw him, I thought ""of course, who else could play a role like this and pull it off"". He's so good at accents and embodying people.Branagh, Blunt, Downey Jr., the sister from Black Widow, Hartnett, Raiden from Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (a personal highlight) - they're all perfectly cast. Not to mention perhaps 10 to 15 other great performances from other actors. It makes me so keen to learn more about the real people and get back into physics. I miss my university years. Also the aging effects are flawless, for lack of a better word.The music is really effective. I correctly guessed it was Ludwig Goransson again (Tenet), who kind of replaced Hans Zimmer who was busy doing Dune. I really enjoyed it. It felt like an extension of some of those themes. Often heavy in intense, but also contemplative and... intellectual I suppose?I'm now intrigued by Oppenheimer. By being so specific in the details of his life, the movie becomes universal. We might not achieve the same things, have the same fears or make the same mistakes, but we can relate to his emotions and experiences. It's all analogous. And few movies touch on life like this.The pace is blistering. Nolan is great at drawing you in, directing your attention, building to climaxes, using parallel timelines to enhance the meaning and suspense of various events. Now the movie is over, I'm left desperate for more. It's 3 hours long, and it certainly felt long, but it was riveting for that length.I personally have mixed feelings about Oppenheimer's politics. Teachers shouldn't be political in front of students. It's not the right venue. And communism was dangerous, not that different from fascism - just different names for insane, incoherent visions which overrule personal freedom and lead to totalitarianism. But the paranoia surrounding communism and treatment of Oppie was probably unwarranted and unhelpful.The bombing of Japan was necessary. Few alternatives existed at the time. Maybe that could have been emphasised more. But this is a movie and its Oppie's movie. He seems like he was a very intelligent and caring man. His fears are still relevant today. I think deterrents work and it's good that the US has the most nuclear weapons in the world. But it's still scary. What if such weapons get in the wrong hands? We're in a new world.Overall, this movie was highly engaging considering it's 95% talking. It's powerful, memorable and thought-provoking. It doesn't try to go into the scientific details, just what we need to know. It doesn't pander with cliches.It's full of important interactions, just as our lives are. It seems to rush through them. We're left with all these fragments as we try to piece them together. All the standard emotions are there - happiness, sadness, anger, betrayal, redemption, hope, fear, etc.I can't wait to learn more about the real events and watch this again in 6 months or a year. Until then, it's making me reflect on my life and, like very few movies (including Schindler's List and E. T.), it reminds me of the immense weight of life itself. How profound it is."
"""Oppenheimer"" (Film, directed by Christopher Nolan, starring Cillian Murphy):Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic masterpiece that delves deep into one of the most crucial periods in history-the creation of the atomic bomb during World War II. With an unparalleled vision and storytelling prowess, Nolan takes the audience on an immersive journey, bringing to life the complexities and moral dilemmas faced by J. Robert Oppenheimer, brilliantly portrayed by the talented Cillian Murphy.The film's attention to historical accuracy and its meticulous recreation of the era is awe-inspiring. Nolan's direction is as gripping as ever, creating a sense of tension and urgency that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats throughout the movie. The use of practical effects and stunning visuals adds an unparalleled level of realism that transports the audience back in time.Cillian Murphy's performance as Oppenheimer is nothing short of remarkable. He effortlessly captures the inner turmoil of the scientist, torn between his loyalty to his country and the ethical implications of developing such a devastating weapon. Murphy's ability to convey complex emotions through nuanced expressions and dialogue makes him the perfect choice for the role.Nolan's signature nonlinear storytelling adds another layer of intrigue to the narrative, unfolding Oppenheimer's life in a non-chronological manner, revealing key events that shaped his character. The film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, complements the storytelling beautifully, enhancing the emotional impact of every scene.""Oppenheimer"" is a thought-provoking film that goes beyond the historical context and addresses broader philosophical themes about the human condition and the responsibilities of scientists in the face of unprecedented power. It challenges the audience to reflect on the consequences of scientific advancements and the choices individuals make in critical moments of history.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is an extraordinary cinematic achievement that combines Christopher Nolan's directorial brilliance, Cillian Murphy's captivating performance, and a compelling historical narrative. This film will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression on viewers, solidifying its place as one of the greatest achievements in modern cinema."
"Oppenheimer is absolutely a testament as to how outstanding Christopher Nolan is in his art of filmmaking.The film is indeed an epic as it presents a story about a scientist whose fascination of the creation of atomic bombs leads to a lot of complexities not just political but even in his personal life.Oppenheimer feels similar to Studio Ghbili's The Wind Rises wherein it does deal with a man who has the love for creating something but his creation used to war. But Nolan's film takes this to a much higher degree with more comprehensive analysis on the characters, not to mention the events he went through.It is a character study and watching the film can make audience not just relate but also bewildered as to the type of man Oppenheimer is - as a scientist, outgoing political man and an ordinary man in general. It also shows the kind of leader he is in handling the project as well as the ups and downs they went through in order to make the first ever atomic bomb.Everyone in the cast was great but Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Were the best ones in the film - truly deserving of Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively.The way the production team managed to re-enact the nuclear bombs is so amazing and it's hard to believe that visual effects had nothing to do with it. Just truly insane.Oppenheimer is already ranking at the top of Christopher Nolan's career to date. With this film alongside Barbie, it is a standout film of 2023."
"The IMDb community will tar and feather me for giving it anything less 9 stars, but I have to be honest here. I thought it was good, not great. It was certainly not my favorite Nolan film.That said, there are undoubtedly some amazing elements to Oppenheimer. The acting, cinematography, and music are all exceptional. I had the privilege of watching it in the original 70 mm format, which was glorious. But even with all of its upsides, this wasn't a perfect movie.Nolan's fixation for nonlinear timelines can sometimes create confusion for the sake of art. The idea of it is fascinating in his science fiction films like Tenet and Interstellar, but was it really necessary in a period piece/biopic?Mind you, Nolan's non-linear storytelling isn't limited to just sci-fi. It was done flawlessly in his film Momento, which wasn't a sci-fi movie. But in Memento, it played a crucial element to the plot. In my opinion, Oppenheimer could have been better as a single linear timeline.Finally, I thought it was a bit too long.I found myself wondering when the film would end at around the 2h 15m mark. The last 45 minutes was like that work meeting that could have just been covered in an email. There was a lot of information that felt superfluous.I know a lot of people love it, and they're not wrong. I just had a different opinion."
"Boring movie, which is mostly political court room scenes.They don't show the Japan bombing but probably because we were ment to see it from oppenheimer's point of view, to which I found the Trinity scene very underwhelming, looks like they just blowed up a big barrel of gasoline. Some unnecessary nude Florence Pugh scenes, which is quite unusual for Nolan.The acting was excellent. But there is too much dialogue and characters being introduced every scene.The part where he is supposed to speak Dutch in Leiden, Netherlands, is not the Dutch language at all. Sounded more like German. Overall 3/10, the movie could have been shorter."
"As Cillian Murphy said, this movie will grab you in the neck and make you fully invest in the whole movie. And that's what it did to me. Oppenheimer is a different level of horrifying movie that will stick with you the next, next, day (or your whole life) and just fully ""explode"" your mind. Just be prepared to be on the edge of your seat as this gripping movie takes you on an exhilarating rollercoaster of emotions and suspense.It's the story of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer and his role in the development of the atomic bomb, and when you thought it will end there, no it's not. That's why Christopher Nolan is called the Master of Storytelling and this is one of his most ambitious work. Everything you expected for is nothing you ever wished for. It's moving on very fast-paced, you will miss it if you blink. This movie will played with you, you'll almost never know what's coming. It's 3 hours long run, Nolan could make it 4 hours and I wouldn't even complain.Cinematography? A f-cking painting. Music? A f-cking opera. Acting? A f-cking cinema. Story? A f-cking shakespeare. Directing? A f-cking Christopher Nolan. Just had to write it in Thomas Selby's way. This is a masterpiece. Cillian Murphy and the whole cast deserve an Oscar. The way the whole cast embodied their character and just... this folks, ain't a movie, it's an experience. If you had a chance to watch it on IMAX, you are very lucky."
"Give it up to Christopher Nolan he knows how to make an Imax picture and he's dictated to this format like no other. Other filmmakers who say they make movies in IMAX are cheating you just a little. Like the last good IMAX movie, Mission: Impossible Dark Reckoning. Christopher McQuarrie knows all the good action scenes to put into IMAX to cheat you out of the entire flick being IMAX but Nolan is not about that and that makes for a beautiful motion picture.But I have to admit, going into this I was thinking Oppenheimer would be like Independence Day in the sense that I came to see something blow up and once that happen, I was done. This movie is soo long and it kept going. I forgot that this movie was about the man that created the bomb not the bomb itselfOverall, Nolan's tells the story of John Oppenheimer and he tells a great story and made a visually stunning movie out of it. One of his best."
"Plays like a chain reaction, bouncing between past and present, actions and consequences. This is a blistering piece of filmmaking that's only flaws are small shortcomings from its gargantuan ambitionElevated by Cillian Murphy's exacting performance, Nolan's biopic on the father of the atomic bomb is majestic and morally complex.The cinematography is magnificent no worries when you have Hoyte Van Hoytema, capturing the awesome power of a bomb while also showcasing the vulnerability and flaws of the humans that created it.Ludwig Göransson Soundtrack is surreal it will make you on your toes.For me it will always be Robert Downey Jr. And Cillian Murphy Performances that carried this movie everybody else was just ok.It's not Nolan's best movie it will always be Inception for me but it's up there with the top, A great cinematic experience that you don't want to miss especially in IMAX."
"The rain halts. Scent of dampened soil permeates, soon to be overwhelmed by that of sweat and lumber. Crimson are the signal lights, as if candles ignited for a sacred ritual, guiding all attention to the dark tower. Simple words are spoken, but at the volume of infinity; the music crescendos. Afar, soldiers lay low in postures of worshipping, solemnity in the eyes behind black goggles. The hatted man nods, the hand quivers, the number zeros. There is silence, and then, there is light.Such is the sequence that glued me to my chair and infatuated me with Nolan's artistry. Despite getting crushed by Barbie in box office, Oppenheimer, in my opinion, is a work of sincerest dedication, and will be remembered as a biographical film of the highest standard.I have no technical term that summarizes Nolan's directing genius, but the result speaks for itself: rhythmically engrossing narration, temporally convoluted storylines, and intriguingly concise buildup. At first, the exposition seems hasty and aimless to me, with too many dangling threads, yet Nolan manages to return to every of those planted seeds at the most unexpected but appropriate timing, sewing individual strings into the most ravishing of embroideries. Per usual, aestheticism, editing, and soundtrack are spot-on --- I do see area of improvement for the last one though, as there is no motivic melody that sticks, just ambient accompanies.A lot more could be said about the movie's philosophy, but personally it all centers around the word ""contradiction"". Oppenheimer is a contradicted man whether in terms of romance, belief, or ethic. His tragedy is his humanhood: human to bare unparalleled intelligence, to bare collective ambitions, and to bare the entirety of guilt. Although imperfect, at least Oppenheimer realizes that all that has happened is above him or his colleagues, which makes him spiritually superior to Strauss, who is limited to mere fame and ego.Phenomenal film, but definitely not a commercial one. I hope Oscar gives Nolan and Murphy some recognition this time."
"Everything about this film is top notch: acting, lighting, sound, dialogue, everything worked perfectly telling a very technical and detailed story. Well done.There were no small parts in the film. Every character was integral to the story. I see multiple award nominations and wins for this great cast. Cillian Murphy is wonderful in the lead role and his portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer has you believing at times your watching a documentary. I have been a Robert Downey Jr fan for a vey long time and this was probably his greatest performance.I am usually not a big fan of jumping around multiple timelines but this film was so well done it worked to perfection."
"It wasn't quite the masterpiece I was hoping for, but Oppenheimer is still a really fantastic movie.Cillian Murphy is terrific and the supporting cast is honestly insane. This might beat The Thin Red Line for the amount of big name actors that show up. Robert Downey Jr. Stole the show. I did feel like Emily Blunt was a bit wasted though. She has one really good scene, but she's mostly just the ""wife"" character.The cinematography, editing, music; it's all top-notch, even if most of the visuals don't really make it a ""must see in IMAX"" movie. The detonation sequence is absolutely breathtaking though.It did start to feel a bit overdramatic at points, with plot twists and lots of shouting courtesy of Jason Clarke's almost cartoonishly evil character. Plus there are times where (despite it's uniquely Nolan structure) it does feel like a rather standard biopic, especially in the first act. That feeling doesn't stick for very long though since the whole thing is so well put together.In the end, I would say this is easily one of my favorite Nolan films. It's great to see him tap into more emotional themes, even when there are still some issues. Also, I absolutely loved the ending."
"Christopher Nolan has done it again with his latest release of Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer is a mind bending epic biopic of the father of the Atom bomb. Now please note this movie might not be for everyone because it is extremely dense with heavy dialogue and stays true to the real life story in life of Oppenheimer. Those who are expecting an action extravagansa will be sadly disappointed. I really enjoyed the visual journey that this film takes you on and it is amazing to me that Nolan used zero CGI shots in this film. This star studded movie showcases some amazing Oscar worthy performances from all of it's Leads with Cillian Murphy, Roberty Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt. Even the smaller roles bring all of their A games. I got the opportunity to watch this in 70mm Imax and when I say this is truly how Nolan wanted you to see it as intended, I mean it. The movie was breathtaking and such an important film to see in this day in age. Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer gets a perfect 10 out of 10 for me. Also I would rank it as one of Nolan's best films ever!"
"A movie that has a poetic description of the life of Robert Oppenheimer. When you do a favour for your own country, but not for the humanity. "" No good deed goes unpunished"".A tragic story of a man questions his morality in order to serve his country, and ""for the greater good"". However, the questioning haunted Oppenheimer that led him to try to encourage governments to stop building World Mass Destruction. But its too late, humanity are doomed by their own creation. Humanity are destined to have blood in their hands ""for their own good"".Plot : 10/10
Directing :10/10
Characters: 9/10
Cinematography: 10/10
Overall: 9.75/10."
"Acting was about as perfect as you can get from the leads, directing was at times brilliant and other times superfluous, editing was timejumpy but made it compelling, seeing Einy was magical, ending was solid, writing was dialogue driven, the best scene was addressing the audience after the event.This is Nolan's most realistic movie, and it is pure Oscar bait. It has a real shot at winning him Best Picture, which would be shocking with the way he's been mostly unaccepted when it comes to awards season.However, as much as I thought it was a very good watch, brilliant at times, a good movie, and interesting, I also felt like it was a little bit too long and focused a little bit too much time on Strauss, when it could have been wrestling with Oppenheimer's moral dilemma or contained a shocking twist of some kind, even if it meant using creative liberties and stretching or embellishing the truth.The Strauss twist just didn't land emotionally or powerfully for the script, even though it was true. And therein lies the biggest weakness of the film- because it's a true story, it plays out like a documentary with little cinematic umph at its climactic moments, but Nolan does better than anyone else could've done with the material to turn it into compelling cinema.Technically, it's great-10/10, but experientially, it lands a little shy from being a true classic. However, I prefer this kind of grounded Nolan like with Memento and The Dark Knight than his overly ambitious sci fi thrillers because they are more relatable to real life. This is one of those one-watch technical gems that get high ratings, but most people would probably never sit through again unless it was for a school history class.7.5/10."
"For me this movie doesn't do anything. The acting is good but that is the only thing that is likeable. There is simply nothing interesting (for me that is) about this movie.There aren't any beautiful shots or suspenseful parts. If there was anything happening then the long runtime would have been fine but now it feels like a chore to sit through.You already know the outcome of making the atomic bomb and you already know America was the first to use one. The only new information about the man for me was the part about his personal life but it wasn't anything to write about apart from making the A bomb, and that is not enough to make a movie about.Once again, my opinion, maybe I am not seeing something about this that others did see. Or I simply do not get it."
"When I was leaving the car, heading to the theatre, my expectations were really low. Then, when I bought the ticket, the trailer was playing on a TV, and I thought I was being stupid by thinking a Christopher Nolan movie would be boring and would suck.When I entered the theatre, the movie started, and my brain turned to this masterpiece!This movie is one of the movies of the century. It's a great never-seen idea, has an excellent story, really well told, and these visuals and cameras are amazingly brought to us from another world.When I leave the theatre with my friends, we were discussing the movie, talking about how good it was. We never thought the atomic bomb story would be like this.The story is amazing a it fells like we're watching everything happening. This movie deserves a lot of Oscars.Stop what you're doing, (unless if what you're doing is watching the movie or buying tickets for it) and go watch this movie! This is one of the great Nolan masterpieces! It deserves your attention."
"Oppenheimer is a breathtaking masterpiece that earns a resounding 10 out of 10! This cinematic gem, directed by the genius Christopher Nolan, transports audiences to the fascinating world of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. From start to finish, the film captivates with its compelling storytelling and remarkable performances.Cillian Murphy delivers a tour-de-force performance as Oppenheimer, flawlessly capturing the complex emotions and moral dilemmas faced by the brilliant physicist during WWII. The supporting cast, including Marion Cotillard and Tom Hardy, adds depth and charisma to the narrative, leaving viewers in awe of their talent.Nolan's direction is nothing short of visionary. His signature mind-bending narrative style keeps us engrossed, blending historical accuracy with a touch of speculative fiction. The visuals are stunning, making the era come alive with meticulous attention to detail.Hans Zimmer's riveting score heightens every scene, intensifying the drama and suspense. The use of practical effects and seamless CGI elevates the film, leaving audiences on the edge of their seats during the heart-pounding action sequences.What sets Oppenheimer apart is its philosophical exploration of the consequences of scientific progress and the moral implications of creating the atomic bomb. The film strikes a perfect balance between historical accuracy and artistic interpretation, prompting thought and reflection long after leaving the theater.Oppenheimer is a monumental cinematic achievement that deserves every accolade it receives. This gripping portrayal of one of history's most influential figures will undoubtedly go down as one of Nolan's finest works. If you seek an enthralling, thought-provoking, and visually stunning experience, this film is an absolute must-see!"
"The story behind the father of the atomic bomb.I enjoyed this movie to be sure! It is surprisingly thrilling and suspenseful despite having literally no true suspense or thrill scenes to speak of. The writing is great, the filmography spectacular, and for many actors this movie has proved to me that they can indeed act!Some issues I have with it are the difficulty in following the story during the first act. But once the audiences is used to the format it is easy to follow. I also could have done away with the fairly explicit sex scenes. One could argue that the one serves a purpose, but most nudity was unnecessary and didn't add to the plot.Nevertheless, the movie does well in keeping its titular character a controversial figure, and excels in suspense through conversation."
"Wow. This film...Is just wow.If there aren't any acting nominations for this film I will be very very surprised.RDJ in my opinion was incredible.Obviously Cillian Murphy was outstanding.Matt Damon wasn't as bad as I thought he would be.I wasn't expecting a lot of the sex scenes tbh. But fair play to Florence Pugh.For me the music in a film matters so much. And I came out of that thinking ""Hans Zimmer must've composed it surely ?"", but no.... Ludwig Goransson !!! Mad. Big up. It was outstanding.The pay off after the Trinity test was immeasurable.I also found the final climax in the third act was well worth the wait, even though the final act did drag a little.The scenes with Einstein were incredible. And Gary Oldman in one scene blew me away !!! I'm watching it again this weekend.I studied this part of history in some detail and to see it on screen was a real treat.This film is a 9/10 for me. Outstanding.PS: Rami Malek 😂😂"
"Christopher Nolan can be immensely proud of the overall performances of all of his cast in 'Oppenheimer', however a certain Mr Murphy, stands out.From the get go, the film sets the tempo of which Nolan is known for - you're hanging on the edge of your seat, sweating and gripping the handles. We all know the eventual outcome of the science that goes on in this film but it really does make you think 'what if'... the risks taken to proceed with the project were straight insanity.Nolan needs to stick to this era, he smashed it with 'Dunkirk' and now 'Oppenheimer' continues a great trend. Perhaps Nolan could next venture into the Vietnam war or even WW1?Must see movie!!"
"I enjoyed it a lot despite its long time.It passed well. There some boredom, but it's good teamwork.Of course, nothing justifies what happened, and no one can be blamed, because everyone was responsible for what happenedBut as a re-creation of what happened.Robert Downey Jr. Excelled as usual, as did Cillian Murphy, and directed
It was very creative, especially the nuclear explosions. Maybe I wanted more and expected better, but I haven't seen a movie in the cinema for a long time. So it's something promising for me.Certainly not as cool as Interstellar.Nothing beats it. It was a long time ago but I still love it."
"Director Christopher Nolan has to be praised for coming up with another very good film, after THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, TENET and others. He connects technology with the human mind more successfully than any other director I can think of these days.That said, OPPENHEIMER suffers from the same overlength problem that had already hurt INCEPTION: Mr. Nolan seems to like 3-hour long movies.Cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema rates extremely high order, the same going for art direction and editing.Acting also deserves praise across the board, even if I felt that Matthew Modine, Anton Kushner and a few other well known actors had to accept largely insignificant, tiny roles just to be part of a prestigious production.The male lead, Cillian Murphy, will probably get Best Actor awards next year. He plays the Hamlet-like figure of J. (a letter that stands for nothing, he admits) Robert Oppenheimer, a physicist/scientist who goes to England, Germany, Austria and other places where WWII would rage soon after, and he sees several women with different kinds of affection and a general distance that he also keeps in relation to communism and politics, prompted to a large extent by his consuming interest in quantum mechanics, and later in the Los Alamos Project, the H and atomic bombs, and above all the human resourcing around the entire project.Murphy looks much older than he does in real life, mirroring the sucked in facial structure of the real Oppenheimer, almost like the face of death. He is on screen most of the time and delivers a top notch performance that reflects his Jewish background and how he senses the danger of Hitler's rise to power and Nazi domination. He brims with intelligence, a scientist's mental abstraction, a remoteness reflected in his relationship with his children (never on his mind, he even asks Chevalier, who he is cuckolding with the lovely Britt Kyle, to keep his oldest child for a while), and the difficulty of steering the course at the helm of a project buffeted by so many contrasting and shifting interests, right up to President Truman's, and including the ignominiously vindictive Lewis Strauss, superbly played by Robert Downey, who also looks much older than in real life, and who came to be viewed as the villain in the AEC proceedings that saw Oppenheimer lose his security clearance.Emily Blunt shines as Oppenheimer's ignored, betrayed wife, who has to look after the children and do house chores while hubby engages in his scientific quests. She encourages him to continue his work even when he feels dejected by the politics surrounding his overwhelming assignment, and urges him to fight to clear his name instead of adopting the Hamletian posture that he seems unable to drop. In the end, she symbolizes the defender and guarantor of the values in the Constitution, even if they get trampled by the military wanting a bomb at all costs and quickly to end the war with Japan, presidential design, and all manner of envy that is typical of such high-powered jobs and duties.I would have liked the film to explain more clearly the importance of dropping the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to beat Russian plans to take Japan, besides the obvious desire to reduce human casualties caused by war, even if at the cost of millions of Japanese lives, and for several generations.OPPENHEIMER offers some insight into pre-, war, and postwar times though, inevitably, history and the actual truth may not have survived unscathed.To conclude, I liked it very much, found it gripping throughout. 8/10."
"Here is what you need to know. Oppenheimer is one of the best films of the decade. This is a film you must see, regardless of whether or not you watch a lot of movies. See it on the biggest IMAX screen you can. It is as much an engrossing document of vital history as it is an unparalleled sensory experience. This film is of course about the invention of nuclear weaponry, and of course, you'll get up close and personal to a real detonation. But that's nowhere near the thrill behind Oppenheimer. In fact, there isn't supposed to be one. Oppenheimer is a blistering indictment of the bomb's creation and a passionate anti-war plea. What's more, is that this is a masterful character study about the man behind the bomb, and the agonizing regret he felt about creating it in the first place.J. Robert Oppenheimer was a curious physicist who in one lifetime received the ultimate praise and the ultimate ire from the nation he belonged to. Summoned by the U. S. military, he served as the brains behind the Manhattan Project and the creation of the first, second and only atomic bombs ever used in battle. For that moment, Oppenheimer brought about the brutal end of a world war, but that was exactly the problem. A brutal end to a brutal war, and forever, the world had changed. Oppenheimer gave birth to the first weapon of mass destruction, and every nation on earth wanted one of their own. The arms race was on. The end of the world, suddenly, a possibility. If that weren't enough already, his greatest scientific ally betrays him in a stunning act of jealousy and personal enrichment, leading to a demoralizing persecution at the hands of the U. S. Government at the height of the red scare.Oppenheimer becomes the physical manifestation of guilt and yes, death. Wracked with unending pain, we see his body begin to consume itself. His eyes stare straight into the abyss. His frame, gaunt and emaciated. Always seemingly on the verge of tears. Cillian Murphy delivers an unforgettable performance that I struggle to think won't land him an Oscar next year. For three hours, Murphy is spellbinding, and that is incredible given the fact that for the most part, he is simply talking with other people. Oppenheimer, by that affect, is not a laborious chore to sit through, but instead, a living and breathing historical account. Robert Downey Jr., as the backstabbing Lewis Strauss is instantly the clear front runner for Best Supporting Actor in a performance that mirrors F. Murray Abraham in Amadeus.Oppenheimer is many great movies in one, and for Christopher Nolan, that comes with so much ease. In every aspect, he approaches the material with the gravity it deserves and not once does it meander and and lose focus of the core information behind the story. That unto itself is a tremendous undertaking, and without a doubt, Nolan passes that test."
"The acting is incredible, it's an A list cast and man do they deliver. The sets, production quality and period accuracy is astonishing. There's a problem though. I felt like they made a superb 3 hour film, chopped it into 100 parts, and then stuck them all back together again at random.It would have been far better if they had made a more conventional chronological biopic. Instead it leaps about through time and styles, with elements of fantasy thrown in too for good measure. For much of the film I was just confused. ""What's happening and when?"" Was my main question throughout the film. Just as I picked up a clue what was going on it jumped to another time frame.Overall a bit too much style over substance. Only one person to blame for that."
"Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped."
"Oppenheimer is by no small margin the most profound movie I've ever seen. It is no exaggeration to say that this film is a work of genius. Not just on part of the directing and screenplay, but interestingly enough, the editing. In a 3-hour movie, there wasn't a single wasted frame. The editing and sound design played such pivotal roles in the film in adding layers of depth beyond even the script and dialogue. I never thought I'd see a movie that has quite literally no action whatsoever but never-the-less never a dull moment. Every scene is pertinent, every line explosive and powerful. Featuring one of the most star-studded casts I've ever seen (I recognized every actor in the movie) giving the performances of their lifetimes, I strongly suspect everyone from the director, editor, writer, composer to the majority of the cast will receive tons of well-deserved accolades for this feature. I went in expecting it to be very good and very powerful. I came out experiencing a masterpiece of cinema, one I'm likely never to forget."
"This is a slow-burn grown-up movie that doesn't rely on CGI, swooshes and/or thuds to make us think we're watching something good. The science seems to be lacking (Oppie was a scientist), but this is a biography, not a Manhattan project development tale (read Rhodes' ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" for that). And given this, so is missing a thorough character development of the protagonist. In the end, we know he succeeded yet cannot pinpoint just how that happened: we know that Groves, aptly played by Damon, was outrageously difficult for a scientist to deal with. The IMAX format was not necessary as the visuals/sets don't get a boost from it. It just has no grand visual elements. But the story and subject matter held my attention. Blunder: I was sorry to (not) see a proper epilogue noting the very recent posthumous reinstatement of Oppenheimer's security clearance. Costuming was poor: 1940s men always wore hats and shirts that were (only) white. Aside from hairstyles (and period autos) the piece felt too modern. Truman's Whitehouse was quite authentic. But it does what a flick is supposed to do: entertain! 8/10."
"Christopher Nolan has created something truly unique. A biopic that is deep, intense, emotional, complex, makes you think, and actually hits you physically through sound... At least in Imax...This is a movie for the ages. There are so many incredible bits, lines, moments, some that feel frozen in time and make you actually ""feel how they felt""... The casting is simply A++ list, including a few surprises, and they're all on their A++++ game... Robert Downey Jr delivers like his life depended on it, Hartnett reminds you of why he was such a hot topic back in the day, Damon is perfect, and Murphy... I mean... it's about time somebody gave that guy a role of this magnitude because he was born for this level of acting....This is one of the ""must watch"" movies of a lifetime. I can see why it wouldn't vibe with some people, but I'm sure most folks will experience the movie in a very intense, rewarding way."
"Best Cinematic Movie of 2023 and OSCAR NOMINATED 2024. Oppenheimer, could be, one of the best biographical movie ever existed. It does have a lot of ""heavy"" conversations but man, it leaves a strong impression and it is so compelling that made me speechless.Star-studded cast was not just for nothing, they truly, truly delivers each character perfectly. Especially Cillian, damn, brilliant performance. I truly wish that I could watch it in IMAX 70mm, the way they originally filmed it with.It is three hours long but I highly recommend you guys to watch Oppenheimer in the best theatre you could find in your city. Yes its gonna be boring if you're just accompanying your friend or S/O without actually intended to invest your time in this."
"Obviously a lot of the talk about Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" has involved its release the same day as Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"". Now that I've seen the former, all that I can say is that you must immediately drop everything and go see this movie, for it reminds you of the world in which we now live.Topping the cast is Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer. Born of humble beginnings, Oppenheimer became a renowned physicist and contributed to the development of nuclear weapons. However, his anti-nuclear activism - combined with his association with leftists in the '30s - drew the government's wrath in the post-war years. Murphy adopts a less-than-handsome look for the role, and looks increasingly disheveled as the movie progresses, showing Oppenheimer's feelings as the government went after him.Equally impressive is Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife Kitty. If you only know Blunt from her audience-pleasing roles (Into the Woods, Mary Poppins Returns, Jungle Cruise), then this will be a pleasant surprise. Kitty was not what we'd call an ""ideal"" wife. Indeed, she often came across as a lousy mother. Maybe part of this was because Robert spent so much time on her work, but she was not the world's most likable person. It was impressive to see Blunt play an abrasive character for a change.But most important is what the movie shows overall. A man who had no malice in his heart helped create the most destructive weapon in history. That, plus the mind-blowing scenes of the nuclear tests, make this almost a horror movie (personal horror, that is).All in all, you should see it if you get a chance. If nothing else, it should remind us of the danger of nuclear weapons. As I read somewhere, as long as they exist, there's the risk that they'll get used.The rest of the cast includes Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek and Kenneth Branagh."
"Oppenheimer is a great film but not without its flaws. No matter how minor or major those flaws, this isn't a flawless film.Christopher Nolan's direction is fantastic and cinematography are just as great. Maybe not one of his best jobs behind the camera but he still made a film like Oppenheimer, that is very intimate and small scale still feel epic. He is one of the last true ""filmmakers.""Now the best job Nolan did with Oppenheimer is the script. I personally think besides maybe Memento and The Prestige, Oppenheimer is the best script his ever written. The dialogue honestly sounded like it was written by a different person. The words just snapped on the screen. Some of the most buzzy dialogue he's ever written.Onto the acting, Cillian Murphy carries the film clearly as J. Robert Oppenheimer but it's more than him just being the main character as all of Hollywood seems to be in the film. His acting is never overshadowed by anyone else and he really deserves an Oscar nom for his performance, one of the best of the year and of his career. Also another actor who deserves an Oscar nom is Matt Damon as Gen. Leslie Groves. His performance is maybe the most showy of the film but he brought some levity and some must needed humor to the film. I think he did a very great job. Now this may be an unpopular opinion but Robert Downey Jr performance just didn't resonate with me. Im he did a fine job and honestly I feel this way because.....The non linear way the story is told is as confusing as some Nolan films but RDJ's character gets lost with the story jumping around time periods. I wasn't quite sure why he was so resentful for Oppenheimer until the last 20 minutes and I suppose that's the point but I couldn't help but think if the story was told in a linear way Downey's character and performance would sat better with me. He is technically the villain in the film but I never got a real sense of that until the very end. I Hope Nolan one day decides to tell a story other than Batman in a traditional fashion. It really could've benefited from it in Oppenheimer.This leads me to the women characters. Emily Blunt & Florence Pugh are both very great in the film but their characters are so underwritten and really have no purpose in the story that's being told. ""Kitty"" played by Emily Blunt is just constantly drunk and hates her life and Florence Pugh's character as a colleague and mistress of Oppenheimer is also a crazy suicidal person. Now this is a true story but for a film about the making of the atomic bomb I don't quite see how these 2 characters in the film were necessary especially for the way they are written and portrayed. For those 2 prestige actresses to basically be drunk and suicidal and having no real baring on Oppenheimers life seemed odd to me. Although Emily Blunt has one of the most memorable scenes in the film while being interrogated. I just felt those actresses could've been used more and had more to do then besides be drunk and hate themselves.Lastly... The Score. It honestly was completely overbearing and distracting for 2/3rds of the film. In every scene where 2 or a group of people are talking in a small room there is a very loud and bombastic score behind it which is utterly annoying. I know this is a Nolan film and every second of screen time needs to be epic but in a film like this that score throughout the entire film was completely unnecessary. If that was cut back considerably my score might be higher than 8 but in certain scenes that I think we're meant to feel powerful because of the dialogue I either could barely hear the words being said or they lost impact but of the obnoxious music playing behind it.Oppenheimer will be one of the best films 2023 for sure. Besides the score and the women being underwritten it's pretty darn amazing. Cillian Murphy for best actor please."
"If you somehow still didn't know Cillian Murphy before watching this film, you'll most certainly never forget him after you've finished. This man has been brilliant in every role he's performed in, but what he accomplished in this film is nothing short of perfection. Christopher Nolan remains the greatest director / filmmaker on the planet, and it's not even close. With the already incredible catalogue he's given us, this just might be his best yet. He makes a 3 hour film feel as if only half an hour has passed. The tension, the love, the scenery, the heartbreak, and the terror.....I mean, it's all there.""It's not for you. It's for them.""My heart hurts just thinking of that line.Bravo."
"If this film don't win Nolan an Oscar, I'm not sure what will!Brilliant acting, loud and magnificent soundtrack, and the mesmerizing end scene. All of these factors are undoubtedly amazing.""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic masterpiece that leaves audiences captivated and moved. The film brilliantly portrays the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. With stellar performances, compelling storytelling, and stunning visuals, it delves into the complexities of science, ethics, and human nature. A must-watch for history buffs and anyone seeking thought-provoking cinema. Truly an unforgettable experience! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"Oppenheimer tells the story of Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), creator of the Atomic bomb and the role he played in WWII. Whilst I wasn't familiar with his backstory, I had to jump on the bandwagon and see what all the fuss was about.Cast wise, it was packed! However maybe too star-studded to the point where I found myself questioning why certain big-name actors were involved in the film given how little screen time they had. Florence Pugh's character was unnecessary, and whilst she may have meant a lot to Oppenheimer, they could have just referenced her instead. Whilst I personally found Cillian Murphy to be emotionless and monotone, I'm not familiar enough with the real life Oppenheimer to know if that was accurate or not.Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr. Have strong performances, and Josh Hartnett deserves a special mention for not aging a day since 1998.It's a long film, and there was a lot of dialogue. During some scenes, I felt like I was in a science lecture and had to try not to doze off, and as for the timeline, it was a bit confusing with black-and-white scenes and coloured ones representing various times that didn't make sense.There's no doubting that this film is great, however I just don't think I'm the type of person who would appreciate it in its finest."
"For the first 30 minutes the movie is Dr Oppenheimer being introduce to other Drs. Endlessly. From there in the film develops into the biographical tale of Oppenheimer's progress from theorist to professor to manager of one of the most life changing science projects in history. Now, Opp isn't a nice guy. He cheats on his wives, he drops his friends in with the rabid Commie hunters in the US at the time, and he doesn't appear to have any outwardly regrets at what he has helped create. Nolan has the, brilliant, Murphy, internalising his ""pain"", but it's all rather meh. There is a long drawn out trial, but not a trial, intended to discredit Oppie. And it's never clear that it actually does. Robert Downey Jr is portrayed as a snidey turncoat for apparently being belittled by Oppie. Yeah, okay. What the audience was really being built up for was the nuclear testing. The real drama. Can the Atom Boys build it in time!!! (I'm not going to spoil this bit). So we get to the testing, in full 70mm and sensurround, Dino vision and double Dolby. And... It's a bit of a let down in I'm honest. We see an explosion. In quite a bit of darkness. That's it. Now this may well reflect what happened. But this is the movies. Nolan could have used some artistic licence to enhance the viewing experience. And after that there is an inexorable meander towards the frankly bland ending. It's well made, really well acted, in particular by Murphy and RDJ, but it could have had 45 minutes of it edited down to a less bum numbing run time and there could have been a bit more sciencey bits on relation to the bomb. Would have been a much better experience as a 3 part TV mini series. Don't hate me."
"This week has seen one of the craziest times for cinema with the release of both Barbie and this film Oppenheimer. Hopefully, this gives cinema the shot in the arm that it needs and truly provides some great cinema. I have seen Oppenheimer and here is my review for the film. The premise of the film examines the life of Robert Oppenheimer, the man who was behind the development of the atomic bomb.Main Character
Cillian Murphy and director Christopher Nolan have been linked for many years and it is finally time for him to be the lead performance as Oppenheimer and he is incredible. This is easily one of the best performances of 2023 and I guarantee that he will be getting an Oscar nomination for this performance. He depicts the role perfectly, he is arrogant but so intelligent, you can tell he is the smartest person in the room and this is amazing to see. Murphy shows different sides to this amazing person and this is a role of a lifetime for him and I am glad that we get the chance to see it.Supporting Characters
Emily Blunt plays his wife Kitty Oppenheimer and she is great in this role. She has one scene in particular where she owns the screen and makes you watch and pay attention to her. She is a strong character and the chemistry between her and Murphy is really good.Matt Damon plays General Leslie Groves and I really liked his character. You see the difference between himself and Oppenheimer but also that given everything that is required that they can work together. He oozed charisma and added some bit of humour which just made this film even better.It is great seeing Robert Downey Jnr in a film that isn't made by Marvel Studios and I swear he is also going to be up for an Oscar nomination for his role as Lewis Strauss. He is in a unique part of the film but delivers a masterful performance and sees how his character is affected by the actions of other characters and how he is losing grip on his lifestyle.Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock is a smaller role in the film but also a really effective role. She is a strong part of the film and I thought she was pretty powerful in all the scenes that she is in and this is another really solid performance for her young career.This film is full of well known actors in smaller roles with my favourites being Jason Clark, Josh Hartnett & Alden Ehrenreich who do really great jobs and maximise the ability with the small amount of minutes that they get.Story
The story is fascinating, it examines different times of Oppenheimers life and how it affects not just himself but the other people around him. There is a lot going on here and the film doesn't really hold back on trying to tell you as much as possible but it really works because of how the story is moulded and performed. I knew very little about Oppenheimer before the film but I am now super interested about him and the life that he led.Script
This film is expertly written. It is very serious due to the subject matter and it doesn't dumb the film down and shows us all the science that is involved in the film. The film has slithers of dark humour in this as well, especially through Damon's performance and that really balances the film well and kept me engaged.Style
The film looks incredible. The cinematography and showing how the bomb can truly affect anything is mesmerising. Christopher Nolan has become such a pivotal and amazing director that the way he makes this film feels like a crucial part of the film. The score by Ludwig Goransson is incredible and adds so much to every scene making it feel like this who amazing experience. The film may be 3 hours but I was never bored here and I thought every scene added something to the film and that is as great as it is.Overall
Overall, Oppenheimer is one of the best films of the year and will be truly remembered. We have been treated to a true cinematic experience and should be experienced on the big screen and I hope people see this film because of the hard work put in by everybody involved.Rating - 10/10."
"The skills of each of the actors plus bringing this skill out of them onto to the big screen by the man with the golden movie ticket (pun intended) Christopher Nolan is very commendable.The background score does it's job of keeping the nuclear explosion sounds a tad underplayed, although the race aspect of building the bomb is never lost with the ticking sounds.The crowds cheering for Oppenheimer in adulation and joy of victory was more overpowering than the bomb. This is the subtle message that was successfully delivered from my point of view.Imagine staring into the screen with those intense eyes having so much to convey but so little that the world undersands from Oppenheimer's POV. Cilian Murphy after having just a couple of almonds day in and day out has just given his best although I was an equal fan of his prior acting skills after having watched his scarecrow portrayal repeatedly. Just superb.The drama that unfolds later is although a bit lengthy was a necessary aspect in building the intricate thinking by Strauss (pronounced Straws) just to prove that his ideology was better than that of Oppenheimer. But more aptly, as a revenge of being ignored by scientists of the time due to Oppenheimer making fun of him in a courtroom. It is a valid motive and Robert Downey Jr does complete justice to the role.The critical piece of the movie is how the complexity is derived by using excellent editing skills mixed with fantastic visuals and background music. This makes for a perfect entertainment for a cinephile along with a thought provoking exit from the movie hall - to bring us to the reality of the world we live in. The chain reaction has begun!!!On a fun note, let's all read Bhagavad Gita and any such books that lead us to enlightenment - just my perspective give or take 😏"
"Oppenheimer might be the best Nolan's film I've watched. Much better than Interstellar and the Dark Knight trilogy.The acting, storytelling, the score and visuals were just amazing in it. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight.This movie proves that Cillian Murphy is a lead actor. The deliverance and his eye movement was a treat of it's own. I couldn't have picked a better actor to play Oppenheimer.RDJ showed us that he can still roll with the big boys of the industry and everyone was just amazing in it.This movie isn't just a story how the atomic bomb was made, but also how Oppenheimer and the entire staff of his scratched and clawed to ""victory"". As a viewer, you immediately join them on this adventure and you feel every bit of tension in this film.The trinity test was the highlight of the movie. It took my breath away and made me feel part of the crew as they saw the bomb explode in front of their eyes.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a silent reminder that cinema is not dead."
"I feel as though I've grown up with Christopher Nolan as a fan of the movies. 'Inception' and 'The Dark Knight' left me exhilarated upon leaving the theatre and I haven't missed a Nolan film since. He raises passions to a boiling point though and sometimes I just don't feel like using the energy trying to engage with his films. That being said 'Oppenheimer' is a return to form and a film I want to praise loudly. I think it is a distillation of what people have liked about Nolan in the past for while offering his most mature dissection of character to date. I don't think 'Oppenheimer' will convert people but it is filled with surprises we don't expect.'Oppenheimer' is entirely built around the buildup to that fateful test and it plays you like a fiddle. The final countdown towards Trinity is one of the most harrowing half hours of film I've experienced with an audience. And it is a slower burn than you'd expect because in the long run 'Oppenheimer' isn't large in scope or scale aside from the moment with the bomb. It's really a costume drama. Who deserves the credit here? Honestly, the marriage of Cillian Murphy and the script is 'Oppenheimer's greatest achievement aside from the visuals. You'd expect Oppenheimer to rhapsodize endlessly but the script is intelligent enough to wait to explore that. Murphy plays Oppenheimer as intelligent but unaware of the implications of looking at the consequences of his actions. There's a motif that keeps repeating about theory vs practice and all along our characters convince themselves that the terrible things they are going to do are necessary until it is too late. The denouement isn't as dramatically compelling but it is essential to the story. This is where the film asks the most of Murphy who loses his intellectual bearing and charisma. Murphy is going to be the odds on favorite at the upcoming Academy Awards and with good reason.A common point of debate I've seen about Nolan is whether or not his films cross into fantasies about right wing strongmen. Frankly, I don't see it even in 'The Dark Knight' where you could most logically make that argument. 'Oppenheimer' puts that complaint to bed for me. The only emotion I felt it invoked was fear. This plays like a taut psychological horror film in areas. America isn't shown to be a good to an evil and Oppenheimer being forced to reconcile with that is one of the films strongest dramatic beats. The ending is probably the vaguest Nolan has ever offered. Oppenheimer achieves a vindication of sorts through the course of the film but it doesn't add up to much in the face of what he has unleashed. Who cares if his intentions were pure? My one complaint about the film and I feel it must be said is that I think there needed to be shown the effects of the bomb on the body and with real photos from Japan in 1945. There is a moment where Oppenheimer is watching a slide show and we see the reaction on his face. The audience needed to be confronted directly.'Oppenheimer' is Nolan at his best. I don't know what will come next but I won't take for granted that we get big spectacles with this caliber of maturity and complexity."

"It's nearly impossible to put into words any kind of worthy analysis of Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer. This is the most mature story Nolan has ever taken on, which without a doubt will alienate some of the auteur's lesser educated fan base and leave them scratching their heads. I know that statement may come off as pompous, but it's true. This film will not impress EVERYBODY. However, for an intellectual, it is beautiful unbiased storytelling at its finest. In my personal opinion it's Christopher Nolan's best film to date.This film is DEEP. It's JACKED full of dialogue, but it's also great dialogue flawless in its delivery from a perfect and carefully constructed cast. The film is loaded with imagery and amazing cinematography that will no doubt keep your eyeballs stimulated. But what truly carries the film is how such an important and historically significant story is told through conversations that are truly compelling. You don't have to be a scientist or a politician to understand this movie. You just have to be interested in the subject matter. It's a film that asks a lot from its audience. Yes, Nolan masterfully SHOWS us what's happening, but you have to listen as well. You can't shy away from listening and rely on it's visuals... because you WILL get lost or dare I say bored. However, for an audience member with a higher attention span that's a good listener, get ready for a story that is so intellectually stimulating and also so horrifying that you will be left utterly speechless while viewing it. My father and I left the theater flabbergasted.The amount of hard work and dedication Christopher Nolan put into adapting the Pulitzer Prize winning biographical book American Prometheus trumps any piece of writing Nolan has done beforehand. I have not read this book, and now I know I MUST read this source material.You will just have to see this movie, because you don't want to hear the plot from me. Just see it. I will say this though. This isn't just a film about making the bomb then dropping it. It's about one man's life and legacy and SO MUCH MORE. This is not your typical Christopher Nolan film. If the film doesn't win best picture... I'd be shocked.Notable highlights for me:Everyone talks about Robert Downey Jr. In this film, and don't get me wrong, he is fantastic in the movie... but Matt Damon was really great. His role may not have been as big as Robert Downey Jr's, but every scene he was in just entertained the hell out of me. One in particular was when Oppy and Groves are trying to convince a scientist to join the Manhattan Project without telling them what it actually is that he's be joining really lets Damon shine and even offers some comic relief... but in the darkest way.The trinity test. Epic. What a sequence.The victory speech at Los Alamos. Wow. Horrifying. I want Nolan to make a horror movie after seeing that.Kitty, Oppenheimer's wife, sticking it to that SOB while being questioned at the hearing in that tiny room.The ending. Honestly, in my opinion one of the best endings in cinematic history that reveals so much truth. Now that's what you call a DOOZY. Damn.I highly recommend this film to an intellectual audience. You will not be disappointed."
"Oppenheimer is the latest film by Christopher Nolan about the legendary J. Robert Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb. Of all the films coming out this year, this was the one I was most hyped for by a wide margin. I've been hyped for this movie for a couple of years really. Mainly because it's by Christopher Nolan. I have to say, it was worth the wait and hype. I'd say this was Nolan's best film, at least since the Dark Knight.I have to say, the films he's done in the past decade plus have not been stellar. Don't get me wrong, Interstellar, Dunkirk, and Tenant are all fine enough, but they don't really measure up to his early work. Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and Inception I'd say are his golden years (the Prestige was good too). I'm glad to say that this film ranks up there with those films. In fact, Oppenheimer might be my favorite movie he's done. I have to think about that, but right now it's between this and The Dark Knight as his best for me.Like every Nolan production, the film looks and sounds stellar. The film is well-acted by everybody, especially Cillian Murphy. It's nice to see him finally getting a lead role in a Nolan production after being in so many of them already. Other standouts in the film are Robert Downey Jr. And Matt Damon. It's also nice to see Downey make a comeback after his last disaster of a film, Dolittle.If you're a major Nolan fan like me, you need to see this on the big screen if able. However, this is not a film for everyone. This is not a blockbuster crowd pleaser, but a long, somber character biopic, with some explicit sexual content thrown in. One scene in particular sex scene did feel a bit unnecessary. I understand what Nolan was going for, but it just felt bizarre and took me out of the rest of the scene a bit. But it was just one little moment. Hardly enough to ruin anything for me, but it might make some uncomfortable."
"Upon viewing Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, the following words come to mind.Riveting. Stirring. Engrossing. Horrifying. Haunting.This 3-hour epic is undoubtedly Nolan's magnum opus, his masterpiece.Every performance is simply perfect.Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer shows his transformation from wonder, to pride, to apprehension, to shock, to overwhelming regret in such a nuanced, emotive way that it guarantees him an Oscar nomination (I hope he wins it).As Strauss, the man who ultimately tries to take Oppenheimer down, Robert Downey Jr. Gives THE performance of his career. It is a stunning portrayal of a man who uses his political muscle to shame and scour the career and reputation of a man he feels slighted him at an event once. Particularly in today's political climate, the implications of his machinations to destroy Oppenheimer based on such a slight are intensely real. I wish I could say his actions are shocking, but those of us who remain politically aware will be far from shocked.The two powerful female performances of the film belong to Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh, playing Kitty Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock, respectively.Florence Pugh gets her chance to shine, particularly in what amounts to the most explicit sex scene in Nolan's ouevre, a scene filmed in such a matter-of-fact way that the explicitness of it is entirely beside the point. I wish we'd had the chance to get to know her character better, but in a film packed with so much to get through in 3 hours, it's understandable that her part of the story has to end relatively early, and her presence is far from forgotten by the end.Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer grows immensely in the third act, as she is the only voice in the room begging her husband to ""fight back, for God's sake."" She becomes the voice of the audience, growing increasingly impatient with Oppenheimer's willingness to martyr himself before a committee that is clearly intent on blaming everything that transpires on him.Matt Damon plays a small, but integral part that the Colonel-turned-General who brings Oppenheimer on to the Project in the first place. He also provides some much-needed humorous moments to the proceedings.This is a film that sticks in the mind. The implications of the conclusions reached here are chilling and all too important.If there was one element I'd change, it might be to put the big reveal of the test explosion at the very end of the film, rather than having it happen 2/3rds of the way through. That, however, is a minor gripe.This is a near-perfect film, one filled with dynamic performances and perfect technical elements, one whose message is deeply, thoughtfully felt, whose implications live on far beyond the viewing experience.This is beyond recommended. It is a must see."
"The world has been waiting for a first class drama to help bring em back to the movies after a shortage of really fine movies for a really long time. I went in hoping that this was gonna be the cinematic miracle that Hollywood has been holding it's breath for. It wasn't. It was a modestly adequate film that I could have skipped. With a running time of close to three hours, this ponderous film just felt repetitive and quite tedious throughout. There's an all star cast that would have been better served by appearing in a movie that had been written and edited with more selectivity. Had I seen it on TV and it had been a half hour shorter, perhaps I'd have thought more of it."
"All These great work by nolan in the past..The casting was great but the screen play was too dry..I literally feel asleep in the 2nd half. Never ever in my life felt asleep in theatre..It should he considered as a documentary of robert j oppenheimer..It's not an movie.The poster is too good for what i saw on screen..
There is drama but everything is just vocal..It didn't connect me as an audience .. It just keeps on going and going. The scene didn't evoke any emotional reaction.I went to see it with such high hope. It just felt like cheated to me as an nolan fan .This surely is over hyped and over rated."
"Going into watching oppenheimer many people felt disappointed because of the court scenes. This is the story of OPPENHEIMER. Not the story behind the a bomb or the manhattan project. Yes that plays a huge part into the life and story of oppenheimer but so does everything that happened after which dramatically effected his life.Nolan takes this and makes it into the most interesting and most spectacle viewing experience i have had in a while in the theatre.The score ..... OMG this score is something other worldly, stands levels above that of inception and interstellar and that is a veryyyyy BIG STATEMENT TO MAKE. But there were times where i felt an atomic bomb to the chest. And having scenes where i was on my toes .Like i said its a masterpiece. Top 3 Nolan film ."
"Beautiful, spectacular, tense, emotional, even better than I expected.. probably one of the best and most accurate docu-drama-movies ever.Cinematography 10/10
Sound 10/10
Script 10/10
Acting 10/10
Costume 10/10
So happy the director didn't ruin it with over CGI and overly fake graphics. The sound effects and sound editing were spectacular. Wish I watched this in IMAX tbh. The acting is excellent. 'Iron man Stark' didn't play his same boring role and actually played a real drama actor for once. There were alot tense moments. Not a dull moment... I can see the controversy over the reading of the Hindu holy book in a scene but none of my hindu friends were angry..they just said the timing of it could have been more appropriate (ie not while in bed).The movie overall was powerful...almost Dark Knight meets Einstein meets Nuclear weapon meets Hiroshima all in one. The movie was not filled with over-woke agenda, the movie just tried to tell it like it was Oppenheimer was definitely not a Communist spy and he was just another victim of the evil McCarthyism. The movie also dumbed down explaining atomic fusion in a way where it was not stupid but rather just simplified...ie it gave the 30 second elevator pitch as to what is an atom bomb. It wasn't insulting to intelligence as alot new Hollywood movies are nowadays. Movies nowadays are so dumbed down by Hollywood but not this one.I might actually watch this movie again, which shows how good and enjoyable it was. It really showed how they tormented Oppenheimer and how extremely intelligent he was. Highly recommended to watch this."
"I would just like as an amateur to express my deepest sympathy for this movie, the purpose, the meaning, the goal and the courage to present complexity, politics and history to disinterested young people, wich unfortunately seem to go deeper and deeper to the futile ignorance of existing in comfort. This is a complex watch, does not align with modern culture and doesn't fear truth, it is not made for masses or public popularity.It is made primarily for the artist who makes it to people, so being him the first person to watch, it is made in the image of the artist himself not the people wich he will profit with.It is for people that seek the good old movie that grows their intellect and does not feed them with propaganda, yes I'm calling out for Barbie.Deeply grateful for this breath of fresh air in a saturated industry."
"Christopher Nolan is a director admired by many for his several pieces of cinematic art. His films ensure epicness, diversity, depth, and a cinematic experience unlike any other. His perception of filmmaking is the very reason he's admired as one of the most superb directors of our time. His movies are nothing short of masterpieces and Oppenheimer is no exception. His movies being newer than the majority of films by other directors also admired for their brilliant minds within and even outside the realm of filmmaking.His movies tend to have a modernized feel. And Oppenheimer is no different, it's fresh, modern with a sad, gritty tone while still having cinematography that makes it vibrant and artistic. At this moment in time, there is no better way to tell the story of Robert J. Oppenheimer ""the man that gave the world the power to destroy itself"". Perhaps if it were different it could be more pleasing. However, the difference would most likely be negligible as the story of the atomic bombs father is told beautifully. The film is a visually stunning, 3-hour-long biopic doing an impeccable job of showing Oppenheimer's pov. Especially emotionally. The film is a sort of 1st person piece of cinematic brilliance hyper-focused on Oppenheimer. An absolute blast, literally and figuratively, this movie is the bomb ""pun intended""I don't like rating films, as you can't help but compare them to others. Moreover, every film is different and most try to be different even if inspiration is taken. However, films are just films at the end of the day be it a humble fun one or a cinematic achievement and a true masterpiece by Nolan that makes you feel a sensation that you would never imagine was possible with a film if it wasn't for Nolan. However, films are easy to just throw a rating at so.....OPPENHEIMER by CHRISTOPHER NOLAN (10/10."
"I love history, especially period pieces, so I was drawn to ""Oppenheimer"" from the get-go. But sometimes period pieces will insert too much modernity into the visuals and dialogue, but Christopher Nolan stayed true to the period. ""Oppenheimer"" is as close to a true undeniable masterpiece as I've seen in a film in years. It is a symphony of powerful performances (Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is brilliant, and his name had better be in many award season nominations), Emily Blunt and Matt Damon were amazing and Christopher Nolan weaved a profound film that went beneath J. Robert Oppenheimer being the ""Father of the Atomic Bomb"". He humanized him and showed us all of his triumphs, insecurities, tragedies, fears and flaws.""Oppenheimer"" is a sublime, haunting and mesmerizing film that makes you think. It stays extremely close to historical fact, and examines the gulf between empathy and compassion as it pertains to science and whether your allegience to your country should ever be stronger than when your conscience and moral compass is telling you what you're doing for your country is intrinsically wrong. And when you choose country over morality, what is the cost? Oppenheimer paid one helluva price for giving Truman and his country something that was truly a weapon of mass destruction. Now, there are bombs 10 times more destructive and deadlier than the Atomic Bomb, and unfortunately, Oppenheimer opened that Pandora's Box and there is no way of ever closing that lid again.Jumping between that Kangaroo Court grilling Oppenheimer withstood because, as we all know, the government will giveth, and it will taketh away if a person doesn't tow the line, to how he came to be the head of the Trinity Project, his personal failings and to the ultimate testing of the Atomic Bomb, was acted and shot amazingly. I don't normally like a lot of time jumps, but this was needed in order to figure out his journey, and to get a glimpse of the man behind the bomb. From the first frame, it draws you into the long-hidden world of J. Robert Oppenheimer.But ultimately what Christoper Nolan showed us is that the true monster in this film was not Oppenheimer's invention, but the insatiable appetite for power, and knowing what kind of destruction the bomb unleashed upon humankind. That realization plays out in Oppenheimer's pained and haunted face all thoughout the entire film.I was transfixed throughout this 3-hour magnum opus of incredible storytelling, cinematography, set design, acting and directing. This is a film that MUST be seen on the big screen to embrace the greatness and enormity of it."
"This movie touched every base and was very well written. It answered so many questions I've had even after visiting the museum several times and with my husband working for the labs himself, I'm even more proud and astonished at all of the history Los Alamos has given. Very interesting, brilliant and sad.The acting was so good. They had film tents set up in the center of town and no way did I think the graphics like the house or buildings would look so much like the 40's.Much effort and thought was put into this film and it's honestly refreshing to see a good movie.10/10 would own on dvd and would watch again!"
"Does the end justify the means?Christopher Nolan's latest film tells a story divided into 3 parts: a geopolitical conflict, the making of the atomic bomb and Oppenheimer vs Lewis Strauss.It's a biographical film, so obviously it's not going to appeal to everyone.Oppenheimer is an intense film, but only for the first two hours; the last act is not as good from an editing point of view, which can be seen as clumsy or destabilizing, but it's an interesting film nonetheless.The film's direction and cinematography are also magnificent. The same can be said of the soundtrack: Hans Zimmer has composed a masterpiece.However, the pace is unbearable: apart from the bomb test scene, where the tension is perfectly set up, the film is rather slow, stretching itself out unnecessarily, not to mention the moral of : ""What? My bomb kills people?!!"" we hear over and over again in the final act.Still, it's good entertainment for movie fans, but it's aimed at a very specific audience that doesn't deserve as much attention."
"Oppenheimer is something else entirely and what makes it so fascinating is that it's so hard to distinguish what it really is. Christopher Nolan's latest and greatest masterwork is a cinematic achievement of blinding brilliance. Achieving a sublime combination of visual grandeur, technical flair, emotional intimacy and an examination of the limits of human endeavour and ambition. The tour-de-force performances are matched only by its ear-blistering musical soundscape by Ludwig Göransson, Oppenheimer is a destructive force to be reckoned with, although I'm still peeved Universal didn't let Nolan detonate an actual nuclear bomb for Trinty."
"Long story short, this could've been a way lot better if it was shorter, less complicated and with a bit less of new character introduction.I had no problem with the timeline changing but throughout the movie I thought that I am missing something, Nolan kept introducing new characters and subjects as if we are already familiar with the story, which we aren't, he should really stop making his movies more complicated, great movies can be simpler too.We should've seen the bomb explode more dramatically (he should've used CGI), seriously, I was not satisfied with the explosion, too mild for an atomic bomb, the audience deserved better.It was 3 hours long and yet I felt tired of the pacing, seemed too fast and jumpy, not enough for the audience to fully understand.The acting was amazing which is not a surprise given that the cast are all superstars, so I won't give credit for that.Overall the movie was ok, but highly overrated and not worth the hype obviously."
"Given a pan of spagetti, you can cook it in different ways, boil it, BBQ it, steam it, anyway you want, but it won't turn out more. You can also cut it to make more pieces, but you still cannot make more out of it.Same for the movie. I don't know why it is rated this high.1. Funny cutting that constantly switches between timelines. And once you think it through you will find it unncessary and too showy.2. Too much conversation happening in short durations in different timelines. Confuses people and hardly get to the point.3. Too many characters popping out in short duration that you cannot even name them when the film is finally finished. Audiences are just struggling with how one character related to another.4. Nolan, starting from TENET, is heading to a strange direction that he makes film not for the audience but for gimmicks.Surely and admittedly, the casting is perfect, acting is perfect, filiming is perfect, everything is perfect except how the story is told, the core of the film, is just oridinary and intentionally scattered all over the place during the 3hrs duration of the movie.You can say that my taste of movie is not good, but I bet you most people walking out of the cinema are just as confused as me because they are already forgetting what happened in the first hour when those last few scenes are coming. Then, when they are home, when they click a youtube video explaining what on earth actually happened, they will just find out: ok, this Nolan guy is just making things complicated because he wants to make things complicated.Will people get Oscar because of this film? Yes, I think so. But, this does not make it any more better than a intentionally complicated film. I just hope more people that watched the movie can be brave enough to write down their actual feelings. I originally rated 5, but after seeing those 10/10 reviews, it is 3 now. I cannot get through why people are praising its weaknesses over and over again. It's Nolan, so what? If a film cannot get to general audience, how can it be the 'best' film?"
"A cinematic spectacle. Oppenheimer is yet another masterclass filmmaking and storytelling from non other than, Christopher Nolan and he has crafted one of the greatest biopics of all time.In his own words, ""J. Robert Oppenheimer, the most important person who ever lived"". This film has exceptional storytelling and mad genius cinematography. Christopher Nolan is a very intelligent person himself, he has proven it since his first film, Following and have given such thought-provoking films like Memento, The Prestige, The Dark Knight, Inception, Interstellar and Tenet. With this, Nolan has proven to be a master at filmmaking taking inspiration from the 2005 book, American Prometheus.This film fires dialogue packed with historical information at a relentless pace and jumps to various times in Oppenheimer's life continuously (from his own perspective as well as Lewis Strauss' perspective) throughout it's 3 hour runtime. The star-studded cast gives phenomenal performance, even a small role has been done by the big name in Hollywood; this proves how big of a name is Nolan and how actors would do anything to work with him.The career best performance from Cillian Murphy must be the highlight of the film but I was really surprised with the final act and how important of a role is of Mr. Downey Jr. The final hour of the film must be the most intense in the film about the atomic bomb. As it unravels, my heart was pounding out of my chest!Aesthetically beautiful cinematography, exceptional performance and terrifying soundtracks.I was stunned looking at the visuals. A great milestone for film industry, as a whole. This film will be remembered throughout, at least for it's visual milestone."
"Not your typical Nolan pic but that's a good thing.Beautifully acted and shot. Fantastically expansive and engaging. Saw it in IMAX though it was not necessary. Wonderfully cinematic score. Love the use of percussion.Highly recommended for history, cinephiles, and Nolan fans. I predict accolades all around and if this doesn't sweep awards season I would be SHOCKED.Fun fact, no CGI. Everything is practical affects. The film is long (3 hours) so choose your breaks in the first hour.Wonderfully surprised by the political story as well. I had no idea. Nolan did a great job of making him human and not judging."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this breathtaking political thriller (which, in my opinion, is mistakenly marketed as psychological horror movie)! As a form, it is very close to Nolan's 'The Prestige.' The rivalry gradually unfolds, and at the end, we get the whole picture. Best suited for those who have some interest and understanding of the development of Physics during World War II and the political scenario of America at that time. And if you are a lover of good old style drama and Christopher Nolan's work, I think that three hours runtime is not too long for a story of this scale! The story material has potential for a mini-series as well."
This movie was a pure display of art. Every scene was extremely impactful and suspenseful. It was a long movie but you were intensely driven in the whole time. Cillian Murphy truly captured the character and showing the human side/ moral dilemmas of a man that believe that he gave the world the power to destroy itself was amazing. It showed showed a very real and what felt like very true side to a life alter event that happened in your history and you could feel every bit of that impact in the audience as these decisions were being made. The acting was great for all characters and the ability to give what felt like back stage passes to one of the biggest events in the past century was amazing. It puts very recent events and current events in perspective and gives the audience a lot to talk about and discuss. Well done.
"Finally caught the biggest film of the year-Oppenheimer, at the big screen. Christopher Nolan grand biographical, as we all know is about the genius of the same name, and who was instrumental in creating the first nuclear weapons. The film is all about Oppenheimer leading the Manhattan Project under General Groves and in collaboration with a number of great scientists, physicists and others. We might have read/ watched a lot about the bombing of Hiroshima/ Nagasaki, but not many are aware about Oppenheimer's credit and what followed aftermath. Christopher Nolan is a legend of modern-day cinema, and this film only cements his reputation further. He took the basic story of a genius, but layered it with his humane side, his weaknesses, his inner voice in backdrop of world at war, communism, and modern history. The film has parallel tracks of the past and present and they create magic on screen. The enquiry scenes are intriguing and the actual testing scenes are thrilling. The film has great performances, and Cillian Murphy walks tall in the title role. It also has great cameos of other great scientists/physicists/professors of that era-Niels Bohr, Edward teller but it is the scenes featuring Albert Einstein which leaves maximum impact. An awesome film in all departments of storytelling and technicalities, this one is one of the best films to come out of Hollywood in recent years, wherein more focus had been on Marvel kind cinema. The film is heavy on dialogues and uses lot of technical and political terms so is a serious watch without light scenes. Inspite of that and the complex topic if people from all over are loving the film, then it is triumph of Nolan, the team and Oppenheimer himself!"
"In the realm of filmmaking history, ""Oppenheimer"" is an awe-inspiring and monumental achievement that captivates audiences from the very first moments. The movie delves into a chilling saga of the enduring impact of politics, which can surpass even the horrors of atomic bombings. Director Christopher Nolan, widely known as Chris, masterfully weaves together a complex and thought-provoking story that unfolds through multiple timelines, rendering seemingly ordinary moments into revolutionary conversations - a signature trait that is uniquely Nolan.Beyond its exceptional visual splendor, the film's narrative is a testament to Nolan's unparalleled storytelling prowess, culminating in a true fusion of his distinct styles. Much like his previous works, ""Oppenheimer"" exhibits a grandeur reminiscent of ""Interstellar"" and ""Inception,"" as it ingeniously manipulates time akin to ""Dunkirk"" and ""Memento,"" while also embracing a dramatic intensity reminiscent of ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Prestige."" The emotional depth woven into the heart of the narrative sets it apart from any other cinematic creation, making it truly one of a kind.The performances in ""Oppenheimer"" are nothing short of extraordinary. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of a tormented character is a revelation, making him a strong contender for a Best Actor Oscar. His performance is genuine and authentic, devoid of any theatricality that might cheapen the experience, unlike Rami Malek's portrayal of Freddy Mercury in another film. Robert Downey Jr. Also shines in his role, showcasing the full range of his acting abilities despite having limited screen time. Meanwhile, Matt Damon and Emily Blunt both deliver exceptional performances, contributing significantly to the movie's excellence. Not a single actor misses the mark in this ensemble cast, including Alden Ehrenreich, Kenneth Branagh, Florence Pugh, and the previously mentioned Rami Malek.In simple terms, ""Oppenheimer"" is a grand and thought-provoking cinematic experience, easily deserving the title of the best movie of the year so far. The film immerses its audience in a world that effortlessly balances the breathtaking visual spectacle with an engaging and multi-layered narrative. Nolan's brilliance in storytelling reaches new heights, and the performances from the cast elevate the film to an unparalleled level of excellence. Such an exceptional work of art should undoubtedly receive recognition in multiple Oscar categories, from the talented supporting cast and lead actors to the behind-the-scenes key players such as the music composer, VFX team, costume designers, editors, and cinematographers.As the movie leaves viewers spellbound and still processing its impact, it is no wonder that many rush to secure tickets for repeat viewings. ""Oppenheimer"" is a golden standard in modern filmmaking, leaving an indelible mark on cinema history and ensuring its place among the all-time greats. For those fortunate enough to experience it on an IMAX screen, it's worth heeding the playful warning to ""keep your wits about you"" and safeguard personal space to fully savor the immersive experience."
"I was very excited to watch Oppenheimer for a long time and it didn't disappoint. It's very interesting and overwhelming film from the start to the end I enjoyed every single second of it and all the details, and I really liked the acting of the characters like Murphy and Robert Downey, Jr. And it is in my top 10 or actually my top five favorite movies of all time the storyline was amazing and everything connected very well. It seems like a story, and I know it's based on a true story. It was very, very good. I thetic of the film was very old money, and I didn't know how to explain it, but it was very luxury in a way that I like it, and the science was like another story like it was very interesting, and the quantum physics and theories was very interesting, and how Oppenheimer was feeling guilty about his own doing, and everything makes sense and they just got the feeling that they got in interstellar that's all top five favorite movies of all time."
"After having a fun time at Hoyts Cinemas with my Dad here's my spoiler-free review of Oppenheimer! As usual, I'll be talking about my thoughts, my favourite moments of watching this movie & my conclusion/rating! Christopher Nolan is back with his latest instalment after the mixed reviews of Tenet and you know what? It's better than that! Cillian Murphy looks older than he does in the director's previous films he's starred in! The rest of the cast is great too, Robert Downey Jr. Is such a talented actor since he is Iron Man and I've only seen the first Sherlock Holmes movie but I'll watch A Game of Shadows before the third one arrives (If it comes out). Along with brilliant performances by Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt (who used an American accent which was weird cuz she's British IRL), Oscar winners; Rami Malek & Gary Oldman (who I didn't recognize while watching it). It was 3 hours long, I was careful not to drink too much water (just like Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One), I fell asleep in bits of it and I stayed awake for the rest of it which was funny! Overall this is not only better than Christopher Nolan's last blockbuster but also Barbie which I won't watch! That's why I'm giving this an 8/10! I look forward to watching movies at home while I wait for Kraven The Hunter to release in October! ;-)"
"I deliberately didn't want to read anything about it before the movie. 90% of the action takes place in a smoky office, which is quite boring. The film is unnecessarily long. It lacks dynamics, action, fantasy,science, mystery.... It seems that in America communism is still a mystical and taboo topic. Interesting for Americans and a little less for us others. The film has probably 300 characters and it is very difficult to keep track of all their names. Albert Einstein seems like a comical character and cannot be taken seriously. I can't say that the film doesn't carry a message but I expected much more from Nolan."
"Nolan is gifted at writing in such a way that characters say much yet in fact say nothing. Nolan's addicted to showing the story out of sequence, and sometimes it works, but it's just overkill now. Thank God for Mr. Nolan, because without his genius we wouldn't know the limits of our eardrums.It would have been nice if this movie actually explained how a nuclear fission bomb works. Maybe explain some of the differences in plutonium and uranium bombs. Maybe something about the Demon Core?No Japanese in sight. Not a single photograph. Where's Ken Watanabe when you need him? I though he and Nolan were homies...
I guess when you're making a film about a man who was (to a very significant extent) responsible for the death of over a hundred thousand Japanese, you want to do your best to not show a single one of them. There was a scene with slides of the wreckage of Hiroshima and Nagasaki but we didn't get to see a singe picture, not one. I guess it's too horrific. Instead we get some unnecessary tits and sex.It was also strange that the most iconic speech that Oppenheimer made is only alluded to twice.3 hours of my life I can never get back.3 stars; one for the costumers, one for the lighting and one for Cillian Murphy."
"I don't believe any film can be a 10 no film is perfect but this film is very close. All the acting is amazing, Cillian Murphy tells a whole story with his eyes giving one of the best solo performances in cinema history , Robert Downey jr really amazed me, I was not expecting his performance to be as good as it was, an Oscar for both of them. Also, not talked enough about whenever this film is mentioned, is how good and believable Matt Damon is as Leslie groves. The cinematography is amazing - I really suggest watching it in imax to get the full experience. The use of music is brilliant. I was hooked from start to finish Nolan's best."
"I originally gave this a 9 because I struggle to give something a 10 but I honestly can't think of a single thing that could be improved or done better. The casting, the editing, the acting, the sound, the pacing... I can't think of a single thing wrong with any of these.For anyone who is put off by the runtime, I watched Indiana Jones a week prior to seeing Oppenheimer and although Oppenheimer is just a little bit longer, Indiana Jones was an absolute endurance test to sit through, in comparison. Every second of Oppenheimer feels pivotal to the experience and I almost wasn't ready for it to end.I don't want to say too much because a million other reviews have said it many times over but this is absolutely one of the most incredible film experiences you could ever hope to have and gives me huge faith that real film making isn't dead."
"Christopher Nolan's movies are among the best ever made, be it his Dark Knight Trilogy, gritty and trope-challenging crime operas that happen to have superheroes in them, or his science-fiction movies like Inception and Interstellar, which are though-provoking, yet still with the required amusement factor for the blockbuster audience. His last sci-fi movie, Tenet, was as high concept as ever, but also complex to a fault, and somewhat lacking a heart to win over the big crowds. But even though every movie that Nolan makes is big, he tends to alternate between something more mainstream (for lack of a better term) and something that feels a bit smaller and more personal. And though it tackles big themes, few of his movies feel so personal as Oppenheimer.In the beginning, it may feel a bit confusing why Nolan keeps moving back and forth in time, but as soon as we are pulled into the narrative, it becomes clear that the emotional core is formed by Dr. Robert Oppenheimer being interrogated in a private hearing. It is the scaffolding for a series of flashbacks that illustrate the topics that are being discussed, from the doctor's beginnings as a promising but clumsy student, to the man who saved America, to an enemy of the state who had to be silenced for not walking in sync with the political climate at the time. At the surface, the movie is a re-telling of a decisive moment in human history, and it is easy to see why the parallels with today's situation makes it such a suitable subject: the ease with which allies can change into enemies; governments eagerly exploiting those with opposite ideas when they are needed, but disposing of them when they stop being useful; and people getting cancelled by labeling their views too liberal or socialist.On another level, Oppenheimer is also a biopic of a man who is brilliant yet also flawed, with many talents and an almost annoying lack of vanity. Apart from his brilliance, his biggest talent is eschewing his own ego by bringing other great minds together on the Manhattan project. He is also a womaniser who has trouble being a family man and a faithful husband, is sometimes too honest, and can step on the wrong toes, like those of his counterpart, Senator Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). Cillian Murphy, Nolan's secret weapon in their sixth collaboration, is great as the man who understands the necessity of what he is inventing, yet is also realistic enough to know where he should stop. None of his shortcomings makes him in any way bad or unqualified, but those are grounds to be silenced even today, especially if one's political views can be easily taken out of context.Nolan skillfully films Oppenheimer's narrative in color, and switches to black-and-white when showing Strauss' side. Which brings us to the third layer within the movie, as a carefully crafted morality tale. For a seemingly simple story about a country at war with ruthless enemies, and scientists being asked to help invent a solution, the film shows that the science and decision-making was not driven by intellect, but more often than not frought with human shortcomings such as pride, resentment, egoism, desires and revulsion. The great thing is that both sides of the drama get ample time and exposure, so that we see why these people do what they did, with the judgment left to the viewer. We are drawn into the movie so well that we can emotionally understand that no one at the time knew the outcome of the morel dilemma, so basically no one's actions were clearly wrong or right; it is only in hindsight that our minds can decide that.In selling the drama, it certainly helps that everyone wants to work with Nolan: even the smallest parts are filled with great artists, from Florence Pugh as the strong-willed mistress, David Krumholz as a scientist with a clear moral compass, to Downey Jr. As an unforgettable two-faced politician, an achievement that should get him Oscar gold.A movie with so many perspectives, topics and timeframes could have easily become a top-heavy mess, and some sides could have been underplayed, but due to a great script, clear direction and skillfull editing, we never get lost in one big jumble of timelines and characters. The makers thoroughly manage to turn it into a great thriller drama in which all the pieces fall into place until the final shot, while still keeping the audience intellectually engaged, captivated and amused throughout the entire 3-hr runtime. And that work of precision may be the biggest achievement of all. Please bring out the Oscars!"
"Theory. Plutonium. Fire. Noise. Death. Morality. Compartmentalization. Oppenheimer.I'm halfway through my Barbenheimer journey, and it's my first in-theater Christopher Nolan experience! I liked what I saw a lot, I love a good borderline psychological horror deep dive into a tortured soul. A film like Spencer comes to mind after watching something like this.The moral conundrum between a scientific genius and the destruction he orchestrated is shown clearly in sequences before, during and after the bomb drops in Japan. The casting was perfect, the film is nothing short of a showcase in acting. It would've been nice to see more of Josh Peck and Devon Bostick, but everyone gives it their all here, especially Cillian Murphy & RDJ.The runtime might be intimidating for some, but it's worth it because in my opinion, not a second is wasted. And that test bomb drop might be one of the most insane things ever made for a film. My jaw legitimately dropped wide open and I couldn't believe how lucky I was to be experiencing this moment in the theater..

"In the months leading up to Oppenheimer, two things were clear from the buzz surrounding it: Christopher Nolan doesn't mess around with digital effects, and its sequence of the Trinity bomb test -- where J. Robert Oppenheimer is indeed ""become Death, destroyer of worlds"" as the Bhagavad Gita passage goes -- was said to be the most powerful and devastating movie scene you'll ever see in a theater, IMAX or otherwise. Conclusion: It seemed likely that this will be the first film to kill its viewers with either fire or radiation poisoning. Tread carefully.In all seriousness, Oppenheimer delivered all that we were promised and then some, rocking me to the core and thence leaving my mind racing in a way that no film has for the past several years. Its success will solidify the revitalization of movie theaters -- Nolan has long been one of the strongest advocates of theaters over home streaming, even with his controversial release of Tenet during the pandemic -- and its quality will do the same for audiences, who can't hope for this kind of experience in the living room unless they have a damn fine set-up. Most importantly, it solidifies that real movies are back on top, as opposed to... well, you know.Based on 2005's The American Prometheus, the film follows the development of the WWII Manhattan Project through various perspectives, some ""subjective"" and some ""objective"", denoted by shifts to black-and-white: the scenes in color show the truth as Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy in a career-defining performance) sees it and are wholly dramatized; the B/W ones are based more on what's documented in literature and court transcripts. It's not entirely linear either, yet there's never any question as to where in the timeline we're at, or who's telling their version of that moment.The rest of the cast is quite considerable. Figures significant to the Manhattan Project, its judicial aftermath, Oppenheimer's personal life, or all three are played (brilliantly) by the likes of Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh (who shares Murphy's prestigious honor of being the first actors filmed naked on 70mm IMAX), Emily Blunt, Benny Safdie, Rami Malek, Kenneth Branagh, Jason Clarke, David Dastmalchian, and even Josh Peck if you can believe it. There are also actors that seem to have either been forgotten or laughed out of the movies that Nolan invites us to reconsider; Dane DeHaan, Josh Hartnett, and Alden Ehrenreich deliver some of the most memorable performances in the movie. Also look out for big names within the fields of math and physics -- quantum or otherwise (Oppenheimer meets with the likes of Heisenberg, Bohr, and even Einstein, with whom he shares some of his best scenes).The film has been rightly described as an intimate story about something massive. And in spite of its runtime and even its contents as such (it's a rather dialogue and character-oriented picture), it is a movie that feels energetic at every turn; through snappy editing and seminally used music and sound, Nolan has made a film whose talky, three-hour totality has the same intensity to it as the final act of any of his other productions. There are knowing glances and vital cutaways that will carry even greater weight on a second viewing.It knows precisely how much to show -- with regard to mass destruction -- and how much to leave to the imagination of its characters as well as us. One of the most striking moments is one in which a Republican statesman simply advises against dropping the Atomic Bomb on Kyoto. Why? Well, because he and his wife vacationed there one time.It's been pointed out that this quick exchange is far more effective a demonstration of the evil and callousness of American Imperialism than had they simply shown how the Japanese suffered as a result of the Hiroshima-Nagasaki strikes -- something that certain reviewers felt was ""missing"" here, but I'll get to that. (One notably funny complaint, however, came from Armond White, who of course thought Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was a better nuke movie and also brought back his ""Nolan's Joker caused the Aurora shooting"" spiel. My guy Armond is hilarious again; truly cinema is back.) Similarly, there's a scene of thunderous applause near the end -- shortly after JRO sees that he has made annihilation itself -- that has been described as ""scarier than any standard violent horror film"", and I tend to agree. Before the bomb itself is even detonated, Nolan manages to give it a most terrifying presence.Having said that, the primary reason to see this in a movie theater is, indeed, the Trinity launch. This sequence -- the heart-racing build-up, the detonation itself, and the tangible awe and despair that follows -- shook me in a way that art hasn't done since Vishnu knows when. I thought for a moment that critics might be exaggerating the impact and subsequent dread of this moment, but I am prepared to argue that it is a paragon of audiovisual art and what it can do for us if we dare let it. JRO has a series of visions -- hallucinations of splitting atoms, dying stars, and other images of annihilation that he alone can truly perceive/fathom -- that also justify seeing this film in the largest possible auditorium with the best possible sound system, but that one scene is reason enough.Regardless, the rest of Oppenheimer is very much a ""Christopher Nolan presentation"" -- it is weighty, technically precise, meticulously told, and powerfully scored by Ludwig Göransson -- but the subject matter and the occasional shifts to monochrome have yielded comparisons to the political epics of Oliver Stone. Nolan has long been among those rare filmmakers whose name is enough to draw a crowd, and now, in an age where the slop that used to dominate the rest of the summer movie season is starting to lose people, he gets to make his masterpiece -- and we all came to see it.This, therefore, isn't just the best film of the year; it's one of the most important of its era. To paraphrase Patrick Willems's Letterboxd review, it's very funny that this, of all things, is a big summer blockbuster. But also quite reassuring."
"It has barely been 30 minutes since Ive seen this Masterpiece in the theater (IMAX of course) and am still trying to process it.The mere storytelling of this 3 hour long movie was masterful. The storybeats take the viewer on a rollercoaster of emotion, something of which I cannot even begin to comprehend or express. The character work of each of the actors was perfection, with smaller cameos from actors I would have not at all expected to see but was very glad to see them when they showed up on screen.I would highly recommend seeing this movie in IMAX. The bomb itself amongst the fantastic soundtrack and sound direction left the theatre shaking.You have to see this movie in the theatre to truly appreciate and fully understand what I mean; it was something special.If I had to pick 1 word to describe this experience, it would be 'Phenomenal'.Highly Recommend. Christopher Nolan and his team have have only gotten better. The craft of Cinema is truly in good hands."
"The pit in your stomach deepens as every layer of this 3-hour experience unravels, revealing what could possibly be the most thought provoking film up to date. There's a level of excellence that is broken down to various elements that complement one another in ways that I could never predetermine. From a shuddering score by Ludwig Göransson, to the distinctively believable cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema, the rattling sound design, the massive and completely grounded cast, and most importantly a story that speaks for itself with the emotions that overwhelm you as you leave the theater. Christopher Nolan never underestimates the intelligence and grasp that humans have while watching his films and he follows that same pattern in his 12th installment by introducing details that seem ambiguous at a first glance until they slowly formulate the defining moments to conclude this film. Cillian Murphy is disciplined in every mannerism that he physically expresses along with every bit of anxiety that he attempts to keep in. Another chapter to mark a defining moment in Nolan's career and hopefully one that will receive its worthy credit."
"I don't know how to put it into words but Nolan just delivered a
MONUMENTAL MASTERPIECE.Movie is not about the attacks on Hiroshima-Nagasaki, or the Bomb, it is all about the Character of Dr. J Robert Oppenheimer played by another genius Cillian Murphy. Oh man what dephths, Christopher brings into his characters, its extraordinary!""Amateurs chase the sun and get burned. Power stays in the Shadow!""- Robert Junior is killing it!!Being an oscar worthy film and with the whole cast, is fine and all, but this one is by far the most well written, flawless, or say its simply Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus!"
"The film looks great is brilliantly acted but there's virtually no actual plot, it's constantly jump back and forward and evey couple of minutes there's unfeasibly loud music trying to build up the tension. This is more a jazzed up documentary than a film and at a painful three hours long it does not hold your attention the entre way. It could easily be forty minutes to an hour less in playtime.There were good bits, some great but but on the whole the film is dull and drags. I've seen it once now and have absolutely no desire to ever see it again. I'm baffled by everyone saying what a masterpiece it is. I suppose if you like long panoramic shots with overbearing music it's great but if you want a decent story give it a miss."
"The acting was great, but the story was disappointing. The first two hours covered nothing. We didn't learn anything about how they invented and created the bomb. The 3rd hour was good with the story of the politics and the hearings. Nothing has changed our government is just as corrupt as it was back then. Could have left out the sex and nudity as it served nothing to the story. People that gave this a high rating is questionable. And the directer advising people to see it on the biggest screan they can is also questionable. Why.. they showed one expolsion and I don't need to see boobs bigger than my hole body lol. The last hour is the only worthy part of this movie. Wait and watch it at home those 3 hours are LONG..."
Christopher Nolan never again disappoints me with all the films he made. But this one is the real deal. Give this man an award for best picture and best director and screenplay. Give Cillan Murphy an award for best actor in leading role. I saw give everyone that worked very hard well on this masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is all I can for everyone who is a big fan of Christopher Nolan films. The IMAX 70MM MUST SURVIVE AND PREVAIL. It is better to watch the film in the best IMAX 70MM FORMAT POSSIBLE. No one and I meant no has ever witnessed this film before.!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I don't really know how to describe a cinematic experience but I think Oppenheimer should be counted as one. You are absorbed into the story, and feel immersed into this world. The movie plays like a thriller slowly revealing new details. Nolan is a master of playing the story non-linearly, but the use of colors contrasting with black and white clearly distinguishes the timeline. We see the lead up to the building of the atomic bomb, and the aftermath. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is just killing it (pun intended), needless to say. I see there is a solid casting and every supporting actor grabs your attention. Even Florence Pugh's small role in the movie is interesting. Emily Blunt's talent is not wasted even with the little screen time she is given. I can say every sensory experience you can get from a movie is fully exploited. The use of sound is very much part of the story, and keeps you feeling anxious throughout. You also feel Cillian's Oppenheimer. I mean Nolan literally bares his character just to show his state of mind and emotion. This is done in various scenes. I could feel the shock Oppenheimer felt when he was cheered on by crowds after learning of the deaths caused by his invention. Whatever emotional journey Oppenheimer is experiencing, I could feel it. I also like how the science is explained simply, and I could grasp the idea of how an atomic bomb works. It was great to see what physicists I had only heard of in name on screen such as Niels Borh, Heisenberg, and most importantly Einstein. It was like the Avengers of geeks, and three hours did not feel long. Robert Downey Jr was brilliant as Lewis Strauss, and I see he channeled a bit of Tony Stark too, but in the unlikable side. Matt Damon was great too, and I like his back and forth with Cillian Murphy. The best part is the explosion scene, and that is worth the wait. I could say they could have ended the movie shortly after the explosion though. Yet, the explosion scene was perfectly executed. It was tense, and showcases the most powerful and unnerving atomic explosion scene in cinema. Nolan perfectly shows how dangerous an atomic bomb is without showing any death, and the impact of it lingers even as the story continues after the explosion. I certainly believe that Oppenheimer will be one of the most important movies of the decade if not of all time. I may even watch it again on the big screen, and yes you do need to watch it on the big screen to fully enjoy it."
"Resounding applause for such a well crafted movie. This might be Christopher Nolan's best entry yet. Snappy, well thought and energetic, Oppenheimer never lets its foot off the gas. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr are absolute juggernauts. You feel each cut, each stare, each word said.The stress expertly overwhelms the audience through insanely good edits and music. The sound design is exceptional. It just all feels so natural and earned. The tension is through the roof and you feel that with every nuance this film brings.Cillian's looks and expressions are just perfect. This guy brings his A Game like never before, same for Robert. The security clearance bit is gripping and intense. It's pretty shocking to be honest. The drama is real and the tone is adequately overbearing and gloomy.At the end of the film, you're just in awe. Truly a memorable experience and unforgettable achievement."
"The story of Oppenheimer and the development of the A-bomb is wonderfully told by Nolan. Nolan uses his non-linear storytelling to great effect, and manages to juggle numerous aspects without getting confusing.What is unexpected is how little screen time is given to the bomb itself. In the hands of another director, there would be excessive scenes of explosions, mushroom clouds and people & buildings being vaporised. Nolan does none of this. The only explosion is the trinity test, and even that is done in a minimalistic way. The Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs are related by radio report and never shown. Even when footage of the aftermath is being shown we do not see it, but instead focus on the reactions of the viewers.What is on display here is the conflict between politics and science, the morality of the military application of science, and the naivete and short-sightedness of pretty much everyone involved in the project.Most importantly, this film does not pass judgement. The dilemma that tormented Oppenheimer is central to the character; he was neither hero nor villain, but a brilliant scientist who was greatly flawed as a human being. Did creating and using the bomb save lives or cost them? No one will ever know for sure. Is mankind capable of not destroying itself? The evidence is not promising. There are no easy answers, but the message that I came away with is this:
Those who have the power to change the world are burdened with the weight about whether they should or not."
"Wow! The hype clip from earlier this year did this film no justice. Scene by scene, line by line you feel Oppenheimer's struggle and his shift in morality. This movie will be mentioned as an all time classic. A masterclass of film making as well as acting. Murphy, Blunt, Downey, & Damon all deserve merit, credit, and all the accolades for top their notch performances. Paced extremely well (a three hour experience) does not feel like three hours. Excellent audio and visuals throughout. There is nothing I can complain or criticize about this film. It's the perfect film. The Godfather level perfection. This should be a fixture at every IMAX theater in perpetuity. Go see it. If you have already seen it once, see it again."
"For the first time I watch a 3 hour's documentary without getting bored for a single minute. This movie is a must watch, The story is more than amazing and the cast got the job done. Outstanding performance from each actor on the movie.Christopher Nolan did all the things that make this movie be one of the top rated movies in all histories.Trust me on this that the income of this movie will cross the 500 Million.A must watch movie and I completely recommend it to anyone even if you don't like documentaries trust me that you will like this one and you will enjoy the 3 hours in it.Thank you guys for this Masterpiece."
"Indeed. A movie about a troubled man who later wrestels with his demons regarding his involvement in the Manhattan project and subsequent acts of violence in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I'm not the judge of that since I don't know how the war in the Pacific would have gone if not for H and N. I'm not the moral arbiter to judge this man and his involvement. Although I believe he was used by the US military.You see much of what I described in Cillian Murphy's acting. He portays a man with some huge demons to live with. The start of the movie is a bit ambigous about why Oppenheimer did what he did in studying in Europe. The movie does say he needed to study quantum mechanics there and I can really see the movie depcts him as a genius who's plagued by what he wants to solve. The sleepless nights at university etc. Later he tries to fight against the system that wants to create more of his devices and more devastating devices. In my opinion Oppenheimer was not responsible for H and N. The generals and president were. The pilots dropping the devices were. I also think that he's pictured to be the one to understand what has happened after the war while others celebrate that the war was won. But at what cost.Act two is basically politics and what the government did to a man who tried going against the tide. They tried to silence him. Rob him of credibility. He is protrayed as the father of the nuclear bomb. (please IMDB that Time magazine, not me)The movie subtly studies the idea and consequences of the actions of these devices. Not for everyone definitely. Though a personal note is good to point out. I've played a few Fallout games and probably been somewhat sensitized. Nevertheles this movie should be 16+ mostly because of some sex scenes which aren't that bad. Basically actors dry humping because that wasn't real. Multiple minutes of needlesly showing boobs on screen. We would have gotten the idea of those two people having an affair with less boobs. It was basically just the actress sitting on his lap and in a chair but that chair thing. Why not put the dress back on? Though, breast aren't genitalia so that's why I said 16+.The other thing that I did not like was cutting too often, in my opinion, back and forth from two hearings to the Los Alamos place. Annoying a bit. They were used as plot devices but still annoying.The thing is, while Oppenheimer helped make the nuclear device, he also helped make nuclear power. If I had to decide I would take nuclear power over coal. Yes, nuclear waste but no greenhouse gasses.A multifaceted movie that does a good job in depicting a troubled man wrestling with demons of his own and the problems of the era. The 1940s were really dark era of mankind."
"'Oppenheimer' is a uniquely intriguing cinematic experience. It feels strangely-miraculous the way Christopher Nolan was able to take-on such complicated and even controversial subject matter and transform it into an intensely absorbing narrative intricately spiced with spectacularly imaginative visuals. Based on the over 700 page award winning biography 'American Prometheus' by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin (which I have read multiple times-over, since it's 2005 publication). The story of how J. Robert Oppenheimer led the Manhattan Project to create the first atomic bombs (before the Axis powers could ever figure it out), later valiantly attempting to limit the probabilities of world-wide Earth-shattering nuclear holocaust.... eventually having his intimate family-life and professional reputation severely disrupted and indelibly injured by the torrent of irrational McCarthyist paranoia sweeping the early 1950's - makes for fascinating material indeed but also an extremely daunting endeavor to capture coherently & compellingly on film due to the sheer complexity of subject matter along with the perplexingly enigmatic nature of the man along with the cruelly-chaotic circumstances of his times. It most definitely feels like only a Top-tier exceedingly gifted writer/Director like Christopher Nolan possessed the artistic vision and innovative resourcefulness to truly bring 'Oppenheimer' to cinematic 'Life' (another critical-factor being Christopher Nolan's inspired choices for matching the very finest actors to their 'perfect' spot-on roles).Cillian Murphy especially projects the otherworldly-luminous intelligence of Oppenheimer and perhaps even more importantly transmits the disquieting feeling that 'Oppie' actually possessed the uncanny awareness (which eventually became disillusioning burden) that he was carrying the weight of the entire World on his shoulders trying to control unremitting nuclear proliferation - not always knowing how to effectively navigate the dark-matter realm of political persuasion. The key to Cillian's emotionally resonant performance is that he evokes tremendous poignancy, communicating agonizing internal-conflict and deep reflection even in the many moments when there is little to no dialog (often thru facial expression alone). Robert Downey Jr. Provides a masterclass thru his complex portrayal of Oppenheimer chief adversary Lewis Strauss - making Strauss a character harboring layers of resentment well-concealed, and it takes practically the entire movie before the audience becomes fully-aware of the manipulative nature of Struss's master-plan to bring Oppenheimer down a few notches.... things ironically come full circle for Strauss which brings a small bit of 'closure' towards finale but Downey Jr.'s performance is so subtle and multi-layered making the Strauss character always fascinating and extremely watchable every time he appears on screen.Emily Blunt is also extremely watchable as Kitty Oppenheimer, J. Robert's formerly 'radical' wife who was a tragic and tormented (and often alcoholic) figure in real life..... but Emily Blunt's portrayal goes a long-way toward 'humanizing' Kitty often showing how fiercely protective she was of J. Robert when the walls were closing in on him. I actually wish there were many more scenes with Kitty because it feels like she often gets 'short-shrift' in the many Oppenheimer biographies I have read, but Emily Blunt's intriguing and humane performance seems to shed new light on the authentic character of Kitty which is refreshing.Matt Damon is sufficiently 'commanding' as General Leslie Groves, the scenes between Groves and Oppenheimer are some of the best in the entire film. The real General Groves was quite a visionary (and somewhat of an authentic genius himself) for choosing Oppenheimer to lead the Manhattan Project in the first place (Groves intuitively understood that only Oppenheimer could effectively cultivate maximum cooperation & optimal creativity from all the eccentric scientific prodigies involved) Groves also fiercely stood by Oppenheimer thru the entire WWII years and it was really the Groves/Oppenheimer professional partnership that guaranteed America would be the first to Unlock and unleash atomic power - Matt Damon and Cillian Murphy authentically transmit this pragmatic professional bond perfectly!Another standout performance is Florence Pugh as un-reformed radical Jean Tatlock who might have been Oppenheimer's truest love but was also an extremely emotionally-fragile Soul who inadvertently brought indelible torment to J. Robert's life (and his relationship with Jean was probably one of the critical detrimental factors in the loss of Security-Clearance due to Jean's lingering radical history and Oppenheimer's lingering love for her). Finally Benny Safdie's portrayal of erratically-brilliant but self-serving Edward Teller (one of Hungary's ultra-brilliant 'Martians of Science' along with top Martian Jon Von Neumann of course) as another essential antagonist (alongside Strauss) although Teller's redeeming quality was that he was a certified 'genius' in terms of innovative scientific creativity, but he also played a crucial role in adding the final nail to Oppenheimer's 'loss of clearance' coffin, but it definitely feels like Oppenheimer and Teller did (at least in the beginning) harbor a mutual respect for each other's scientific 'gifts' which is exhibited on-screen so Safdie/Teller's film presence is always compelling.Overall, I agree that Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer' is a major Cinematic achievement that ensures him a place in the Top-tier of All-time finest movie Director's (alongside Kubrick et al) not only from a creatively artistic standpoint but from his sheer force-of-will and persistence to even get an immensely challenging project like 'Oppenheimer' financed, off the ground and on to those IMAX 65mm screens for all movie fans (and other imaginative dreamers) to See!"
"At least 30 minutes could be cut without losing any of the story. The time jumps are confusing, though not as frenetic as in Dunkirk. The story is interesting, and the acting is well done. The film fails the Bechdel test in every way, and is in that regard an anti-Barbie. There are a few female characters, but they only exist to expound the story of men. Kitty especially should have been featured more, rather than a crabby and bitter shell. Why was she so miserable? We can imagine, but would've been great to see her story.The weirdest thing they did was leave Murphy's double pierced ear visible in multiple closeup scenes. It was distracting and easily fixable."
"No human on the planet has a bigger cult of personality than Christopher Nolan. Not Trump, not Musk, not Messi, not Putin. No one.His fans see everything he has done as a masterpiece. It's not just that he can't do no wrong, but that he can't do no average.Yet that's exactly what this movie is. An average biopic.Advertised as a visual masterpiece, it actually makes no difference whether you watch it in IMAX or not. Facial close ups and office meetings make up for 90% of the movie. Few desert shots and a very, very brief explosion scene don't warrant the price. Nor the hype.Additionally, I'd say that the Terminator franchise presented the dangers of nuclear war far better and visually more stunning. Maybe even Stargate too.Everything presented can be expected, many common character clichés are present. The runtime is another decision driven by Nolan's ego. The score was clever at times.The spectacle is somewhat created by having a great actor fill every role, yet few are given any jobs that an average drama student couldn't fulfill.I enjoy Nolan's work, bar Tenet, which was at least ambitious. Yet Oppenheimer is just coasting on reputation."
"First off, please please go see and support this film!Oppenheimer tells the real life story of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the many intricacies of his life throughout university and then leading to his work on the Manhattan Project. I will tell you right off I left the theater in awe and, looking back on it now, a little disconcerted with the last few scenes of the film. (Once you see, you'll understand) Christopher Nolan has once again simply outdone himself with this film, he is my favorite filmmaker working today and seems to be one of the only filmmakers to be given the budget to make massive films like Oppenheimer, Interstellar, Inception, Tenet, Dunkirk, and so many more to support going to the movies.The film is, yes, three hours long and very dialogue heavy but this three hour film went by with the snap of a finger. Nolan does a brilliant job of accelerating the pace of the film and it sort of traps you and locks you in place. Throughout watching the film thirty minutes of it was just gone, like it had evaporated. Nolan does a brilliant job editing his films to where there is little to no fat left around the edges and no extra baggage, every scene has its place.You will definitely, and I for one, will have to watch this film more than once as there is just so much too unpack with this film. The star power in this film alone is tremendous, the score is mesmerizing, the visual effects fantastic, the performances are enthralling, and Chris Nolan is at the top of his game!This film should and will get a lot of love and praise come awards season. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Shine in this film and their performances are one of, if not the, best of their respective careers. Christopher Nolan deserves at least nominations for Best Director, Best Adapted or Original Screenplay, and Best Picture at the Oscars, and he should definitely win his first Oscar this awards season. While Cillian Murphy deserves at least a nomination for Best Actor and Robert Downey Jr. Deserves a nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars as well. Both of them could win both with these performances easily.A truly tremendous film and one that requires multiple viewings to be truly appreciated!"
"Yes, this is a 3 hour movie with 99.9% talking, the other 0.1% is stuff involving bombs or chemical reactions. I would say I was not bored in this movie. I went in knowing its gonna be 3 damn hours, but Nolan did a great job of pacing, the music really helped make this movie not a snooze-fest. Also, do not go in expecting to see explosions and all this war stuff, there is not a single image of war in this film, which is a great choice. Minor spoiler but they don't test the atomic bomb until pass the 2 hour mark.If you are interested in the subject matter like me, you will find a really well done and perfectly acted film. There is not really a lot to complain about, but I feel this movie is best watched with subtitles since there are a lot of talking, a lot of names, a lot of accents, and sometimes you can't really hear what is being said because of the loud music.I would go and even say this is Nolan's best film since Inception, which has gotten better over the years in my opinion. I would love to re-watch this again with subtitles. Also the acting is great, and awesome to see Josh Harnett back. He really is an underrated actor.Anyways I say 9/10 because even though it is 3 hours long, it still felt like stuff was missing at certain points, Oppenheimer's wife barely had any characters, they jump two years in time and it didn't really feel like that was done smoothly.Anyways, a great film, 9/10."
"When you see Oppenheimer, what catches your attention is how a three-hour film full of dialogue is so long and doesn't get boring. The wonderful Murphy plays the role of Oppenheimer, and the good thing about the film is that instead of being about the atomic bomb, it is about Oppenheimer himself.The film is able to portray the pressure and torment of conscience that Oppenheimer suffers after the bombing in Hiroshima and also raises a big question. Whether the things we got after the atomic bomb were worth it or not.I recommend to all cinema friends and fans of Nolan not to miss Nolan's three-hour masterpiece about the most important 4 lines in history."
A man who would forever change the world. This story is masterfully presented to us by Nolan in a biopic opera style film that is one of the most brilliant character studies that feels larger than life.Cillian Murphy is beyond excellent in this role. He says so much with his eyes and facial expressions that you know exactly how he feels in each scene. Robert Downey Jr comes back to acting when he clearly doesn't need to. He's a fantastic actor and the subtle times we do see him he grasps the audience!The soundtrack and sound design of this film is magnificent. From the pounding of explosions to the rumbling of chemical reactions. It feels like an amusement park ride and the nuclear bomb is the tippy top of it.Nolan relies heavily on exposition in this film more so than he does in other ones as this is a singular character focused story. There are alot of things that need to be explaining and it's all justified.An important piece of history is magnified into tiny atoms and blown up on the big screen in the most cinematic of fashions. Nolan draws the crowds and this one is a must see on the big screen.
"This film deserves its own watch, separate from the double feature memes encouraged on social media.First, Oppenheimer itself is a weighty subject for a biopic.But mainly, this film is so nuanced, so rich, so textured in acting and videography, it just deserves time.Maybe a couple of watches, in fact, especially when it eventually goes out of theaters to streaming.Well worth the ticket price, however, so I might even pay that twice.Director Nolan deftly handles time cuts back and forth and makes every bit of his three hours in the theater count. (I worried at such a lengthy movie, but honestly the time flew.)Cillian Murphy is amazing as the.eponymous character. He manages to play all ages of Oppenheimer--I was dubious going in having heard this, but the man pulls it off.Murphy's range as an actor is amazing and he conveys both the patriotism and ego that led Oppenheimer to sign up as well as the change of heart he had in later years.Emily Blunt stands toe to toe as Oppenheimer's wife. She is strong enough to really act as his partner. And Blunt's rendition of Kitty responding to a board inquiry was so subtle (*chefs kiss*)Rami Malek as David Hill had a moment in a senate hearing had the audience actually cheer, but every single scientist/cast member was just spot on in their struggle to pursue theories without becoming part of the military group think atmosphere.And I really need to look up the real Leslie Groves and his story. Matt Damon played the part both as rather prickly, and yet with a strong sense of respect between the men.This sort of heroic character suits Damon well and the character felt like a real backbone throughout the piece.Now. Personally. I just want to give huge kudos to Robert Downey Junior as Lewis Strauss. RDJ has been in the big budget Avengers movies recently, a franchise which has been hit or miss for me overall.In Oppenheimer the actor proves once again how skilled he is playing heavier drama outside of genre. The Strauss story line was complicated and kept us all engaged until the very end (another cheer went up when he wasn't confirmed)Honestly, with such directing and acting, that should be enough.But every single department hits a home run.The effects--both sound and visual--are amazing.The musical score was perfect and elevated the experience even more.Frankly, you name it, I'd brag on it.But again, the topic is weighty and might take a second watch to catch all that I want to say.Even the feeling of existential crisis and messages for viewers were carefully enough placed that I felt ""reached"" rather than ""preached to"" and the payoff of that means digging into some books as well.Editing hit a couple of jump scares that actually caught me (and I usually never flinch at all.)"
"It's just astonishing how with such high expectations from everyone, Nolan still manages to deliver this master work, he has been my favorite director for quite some time, and there were many occasions where his films felt unrecognized (not by his peers which ultimately is more important) but by the award community, I hope this year things change.Cinema in its purest form, a high pace thrilling experience, one of the first aspects that amazed me about this movie in fact is that it's a biopic, and most biopics no matter how interesting the person they are telling the story about is, they tend to become tedious but somehow Nolan transformed this into an anxiety inducing exhilarating story.It feels as tragic as educational, while Nolan did an amazing job finding that balance of simply telling the story from Oppenheimer perspective without polarizing the political matters in place, and potentially antagonizing his audience, this is still a cautionary tale.How is it that we as a species manage to achieve greatness and we go back to our most tribal instincts when it comes to harm each other?How is it we are so good in bringing people together and with such great minds we have in the world we point them to fabricate the weapons of our own destruction instead of fomenting that knowledge and apply it to make our species a better peaceful version of ourselves?This movie has many layers to it, but the one that sticks out the most is redemption, we corrupt the people who are responsible for the development of our civilizations and contribute to further our knowledge and we discard them unless there's a use for them in the big war machine.Its hard to make a review about the film but be mindful that this is indeed a masterpiece, it's not the usual mind bending Sci-Fi experience Nolan usually creates, it might be even scarier as its an actual real life story that we should all learn from it and I can't finish this review without mentioning the Oscar worthy performances from Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr."
"The much awaited historical entry from one of my favourite directors, Christopher Nolan, is finally out. It's being well received from critics and audiences alike. After watching it, I can say it more or less deserves that reception.I did have the fear of not understanding this movie. Nolan has a habit of making his films as ground-breaking as possible. He doesn't want his movies to feel normal. He speeds up his storytelling and makes his dialogue scenes as brief as possible to keep the audience's brain working the whole time. So yes, in this film too, there are things that I missed. I understood the story, but I missed many character details that were thrown at me very fast in multiple different scenes. And I'm not sure whether this story even needed the non-linear way in which it was told here. You'll need multiple viewings to fully understand this film.Let's now talk about everything else. The story is available through various forms of media already. So I don't think anything new was written into this movie. What this movie had to do though, was to show this existing story. That it did - through brilliant direction, phenomenal performances, jaw-dropping soundtracks and the intensity that all of them brought to the story. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of the psychological effects on Oppenheimer, and Nolan's vision made a scintillating combo. In fact there are so many brilliant performances here - Jason Clarke, Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, all of them give some intense performances. Ludwig Goransson's score is just chilling (the composer of Black Panther). There are so many scenes here that just gave me goosebumps. There's a scene where Jason Clarke's character is arguing with Oppenheimer, and that entire scene was just amazingly performed and made by everyone. There's also the Trinity test scene which was brilliantly directed by Nolan. There are many such scenes.Overall I do think this is a great movie, but I'll definitely have to watch it again to believe that. It's great to see a historical drama be so successful at the theatres."
"To begin with, I want to make my opinion clear right away, this film is a MASTERPIECE! And it gave me feelings of ""12 Angry Men"" which is absolutely brilliant!It's epic. It's magic. It's strong. It's disturbing.The look is disturbing.Breathing is disturbing.The silence is disturbing.But it's beautiful!A film about a Man and not about an event, which takes the film to a completely different level!A film with constant dialogues, on different themes, with different characters that keep appearing. Just like life is, with constant changes, constant relationships, constant experiences.It's not an easy movie to follow. Every 5 seconds, the settings change, the dialogues change, the clothes change, the characters change... Timelines that mix and met at every moment. Dialogues that are completed at different times, and are related in crossed lines. It's a Nolan brand, it's auteur cinema. Sometimes, it's not easy to follow, especially in the first minutes, and it's something that makes the film not so accessible, but that makes it very rich!The settings are beautiful, the short shots in the actors enhance the film and the feelings that the characters are feeling, the long shots remind us of human smallness and the size of the bomb, of how insignificant we are if that power gets out of control, how powerless we are in the face of that.And if the first part moves us, frightens, disturbs, the second is not far behind. Through a well-developed plot, well tied, with very interesting dialogues and presences, the film manages to deliver the same tension as the bomb. And that's an incredible feat on the part of the script! It causes us again sensations of fear, apprehension, anger, frustration, for how cruel and insensitive the world can be, how science can be disrespected, how human beings can be as ""destructive"" as a bomb, when trying to go over everything and everyone, not caring about people's feelings, their suffering. It's a part that shows that through insensitivity a man can be as toxic and destructive as a bomb.Oppenheimer is very rich, it's a film that I'll have to watch 2, 3, 4 times to absorb every drop of sweat that Nolan, Murphy, the entire cast and all the people involved from photography, to sound, to wardrobe put into this project!Oppenheimer, it's not about a bomb, it's about the human being and life!"
"Was looking forward to seeing this movie on the big screen. Big fan of Nolan's previous movies and I usually like political and historical drama. On one side giving this movie anything less than '7' is hard, due to spectacular technical creation and a wonderful story told, but also I would argue that this movie does not deliver enough for its 3 hours length, in terms of interest and emotional attachment for the audience.I think most people will agree on what makes this movie a great Hollywood production, intense story and great level of realism, however here is a list of things that I didn't like:1. Unlike popular opinion, I did not like the casting. The actor list is full with big names, but many of them could have been better casted, in particular I did not like the cast of Matt Damon (as Leslie Groves, the army general) and Tom Conti as Albert Einstein. Even more unpopular, I think R. Downey Jr. Is also a bad cast and I kept seeing Iron Man instead of the character he was playing.2. It's quite boring. By at large the movie is pretty uneventful, there are pretty much 3 events - 1 is a surreal sex scene, 2 is the blow-up experiment, and 3 is the aftermath ""trial"". By the 3rd hour I saw people starting to check their phones in the theater. I usually get very upset of people that check the phone during the movie, but in this case I could totally relate with them.3. Failure to create emotion. I'm not sure what it is, but something really kept me from identifying with any of the characters. It is almost like the actors were too good for the role they are given in the movie, so a little tie-in with my complaint on the casting, or it could be the strong left-wing vibes in the movie, but the bottom-line is that you are not really feeling the pain of any of the characters.So, it's a '7', probably will win an Oscar or two. It is an important historical story but it felt too much like a history lesson then an entertainment piece, so overall disappointing for me as a big-screen experience and a Nolan fan."
"Yes, the acting for the most part is excellent. However, the movie/story does a grave injustice to the portrayal of a brilliant and complex human being. It presents a poorly edited one dimensional view of his life, a disjointed story dwelling mostly on political issues and travails. There was very little portrayal of his leadership skills in assembling brilliant minds to solve extremely complex, complicated issues. Overall, a missed opportunity to present the true richness of this incredible mind to the world. The editing seemed calculated to provide some of the actors with more screen time, and an opportunity to demonstrate their acting. By the end, I found myself wondering when it would end."
"Best movie in my lifetime. All aspects were exemplary: the acting, the writing, the cinematography, ... I've never paid much attention to which director is doing what, but Christopher Nolan is one to watch for. Brilliant.Murphy was superb, as were all the supporting actors: Downey Jr., Blunt, Damon. Believable, moving, stunning performances. Top-notch writing and directing allowed these thespians to show the world how talented they can be.""Character development"" is tricky to do well. If a writer makes a character too unlikeable, the audience (or reader) won't continue to watch. Blunt's character, Kitty Oppenheimer, is a paradigm of character development. Like it or not, ""bad mom"" is a precise weapon used to cut down a woman. It's risky, then, for a writer to introduce us to a female character who is a bad mom, acts eccentrically, and has a drinking problem. Yet by the end of the movie, Blunt has us loving Kitty and cheering her for her strengths and character. Besides the great acting, this movie displayed the best example of writing character development I have ever seen.The cinematography was brilliant. I'll let others describe the details. I went into the theatre thinking the movie was going to be good. This anticipation made me a little worried that I'd be disappointed, because that's what usually happens when you go into a theatre with high expectations. Seeing the all-star cast is another warning sign of disappointment. Contrary to all past experiences, this movie exceeded my high expectations, and I walked out of the cinema mind-blown.I appreciate that the writers and Nolan showed the different ethical arguments, the philosophical debates, the moral quandaries with a deep dive into this sensitive subject. He/they didn't pander to popular political sensitivities, yet made it extremely sensitive in a thought-provoking, honest way. Nolan's integrity shone."
"I've just witnessed the incredible work of Director Christopher Nolan, who successfully crafted a suspenseful thriller intertwined with a documentary about Robert J. Oppenheimer. I couldn't be more thrilled and amazed by his talent once again. The movie captivates with its fast pace and compelling characters, particularly Oppenheimer, who finds himself questioned in a hearing room, struggling to obtain security clearance.I must express my admiration for Robert Downey Jr., who delivers a pivotal performance in portraying Oppenheimer. Cillian Murphy also shines brilliantly as the father of the Atomic Bomb, showcasing Oppenheimer's guilt and humanity. The film delves into the profound impact of his actions, forever haunting him. Nolan skillfully weaves together the development of the atomic bomb, accusations of manipulation, and the fragile trust surrounding leaked information, creating a truly remarkable narrative. This director's ability to transform a documentary into an emotionally charged character-driven film is truly outstanding. It's an absolute pleasure to have experienced such a fantastic piece of cinema."
"Christopher Nolan's grandly ambitious film about J. Robert Oppenheimer takes on incredible dimensions such that it reaches beyond the contours of the typical Hollywood biopic. This film is also a retelling of America's desperate effort during WW2 to successfully construct a nuclear bomb before the Nazis could. It's also a sobering depiction of America's intense paranoia toward alleged communist sympathizers during the Cold War and beforehand. On both fronts, Nolan's portrayal is remarkably effective.Cillian Murphy gives the best performance of his career thus far as the utterly determined scientist whose brilliance was able to overcome his incidental flaws as a husband, coworker and government mercenary. We see the world at the dawn of startling change through his quietly terrified eyes. It's a magnificent breakthrough for science but for humanity, a new age of fear and uncertainty and Murphy's performance is the guiding hand. Strong supporting performances abound. Emily Blunt is effective as the thick-skinned wife. Matt Damon is the straight-talking Lt. General Leslie Groves who oversaw the Manhattan Project. Robert Downey Jr. Plays against type as Lewis Strauss, a founding member of the Atomic Energy Commission whose working relationship with Oppenheimer turns into a point of contention later in the film.The film's emotional high points are toward the end after a very early preview of the psychological turmoil that Oppenheimer goes through in comprehending the ramifications for humanity in the wake of his miraculous breakthrough. Without going into too much detail, it's a portrayal of the pitfalls of genius and immense responsibility. You leave with gratitude and humility for this part of history as a lesson but also as a cautionary tale on whom you can trust. Whether you watch as a film buff, a history buff or someone with a science background, it's a rare, rewarding film experience. A superb achievement and highly recommended."
"It's rare to experience a movie like Oppenheimer in the contemporary Hollywood. This is Nolan at his best, using his experience in ways you'd never imagine.You are immediately hypnotised by the chilling soundtrack of Ludwig. The visuals and the brilliant dialogue are breathtaking.With a relentless pace that makes three hours go by inconspicuously. I somehow didn't realise how the last 30 mins of the movie passed by, and yet I felt like it could've used a few extra minutes.Condensing a book like American Prometheus into a 3 hour movie is a great feat.If this is Nolan's attempt at going for an Oscar, I wouldn't necessarily argue it. But I would add that this movie doesn't look like an Oscar bait. It's still got Nolan's touch."
"A truly well made movie about the triumph and tragedy of physicist Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. It is also a movie about Cillian Murphy who has established himself as a truly capable thespian having come a long way since the compelling ""The Wind that Shakes the Barley"", and the more recent tv series ""Peaky Blinders"" with the trademark chain smoking and careful straightening of the porkpie hat brim, also observed in ""Oppenheimer"". I'd be surprised if his latest flawless role execution didn't land him an Oscar, or at least a nomination for one. What perhaps might work against it, would be the enduring sensitivities surrounding the use of the atomic bomb and the vital role that Oppenheimer played in its development. But, his country asked him to do something and he did it brilliantly. He was a brilliant scientist after all, and in the world we don't only have scientists but we also have politicians. Take a guess who could be more dangerous.Like Prometheus, in one of the legendary Greek myths, who stole fire from the gods and bringing it to humans to better their lives, but not without consequences, that also meant giving humans a moral choice to use the ""tool"" for good or for evil.If there was a criticism of the movie, that would perhaps be the witch-hunt campaign directed against Oppenheimer and which, in my view, did not seem to jump out of the movie with the deserved poignance around this rather tragic part in his life and scientific career."
"With his affinity for mind-bending, time-bending action spectacle blending brains and brawn, Christopher Nolan's blockbusters have a dedicated following among cinephiles. For Nolan, no amount of practical affects is too ambitious, no amount of IMAX cameras. I've always been a huge Nolan fan, and while it may sound a bit cliché to say this, films like ""The Dark Knight,"" ""The Prestige,"" and ""Inception"" have had a formidable effect on my understanding of film. They taught me how audience expectations from blockbusters can be subverted by a formidable auteur, how action sequences can be combined with a cerebral narrative that conceptually integrates intellectual concepts as the backbone of the storytelling, and how to expect the unexpected from original and creative storytelling. Nolan's new film, ""Oppenheimer,"" may sound a bit more conventional and by-the-numbers than some of his other films, but viewers should rest assured that he has plenty of tricks up his sleeve to keep viewers engaged and thrilled. It is a completely riveting and extraordinarily well-made work that, in my opinion, is Nolan's best film.From the first frame to the moment the credits roll, viewers feel that Nolan is in total control of his craft throughout. Nolan's immaculate technical precision is on full display here, alternating between color and black-and-white sequences to stunning results. The precision and framing of nearly every shot in the film feels concise, controlled, and just like the highest possible levels of art--from wide shots of the New Mexico desert to intimate shots of a character's face. It all feels immaculately controlled and derived from a singular vision, to thrilling results rarely seen in modern movies. But what makes ""Oppenheimer"" so extraordinary is how it differs from Nolan's other films. It is not really an action film compared to most of his others, but the film is just as adrenaline-pumping, visceral, and intense. This effect is achieved by gripping nuclear test sequences as well as intense scenes of Oppenheimer's dreams and visions, as well as audio-visual depictions of the physical properties behind the atomic bomb. Credit is owed to an extraordinary sound design (perhaps some of the most gripping and intense sound design I've ever heard in a movie theater) and a powerful, melancholy score that accentuates every scene and further serves to demand the viewer's attentiveness throughout. Fortunately, the dialogue is completely audible and the score is never overbearing, which has been a complaint before about some of Nolan's other films.Some of Nolan's detractors have criticized his films in the past as simply clinical and cold intellectual exercises. I don't agree with them in general (although I was not a fan of ""Tenet,"" his weakest film) and am very much of a fan, but to some extent I can understand their arguments. However, the character development in ""Oppenheimer"" is comprehensive and brilliantly complemented by Nolan's screenplay, and the attention to a more character-driven film is something that sets this film above Nolan's others in my book. The actors further help the character-driven backbone of the narrative, particularly Cillian Murphy, who provides the best performance of the year. He truly inhabits Oppenheimer in every way imaginable, portraying a full acting range based on scientific inquiry, worry, and sorrow. ""Oppenheimer"" is both a gripping, IMAX-shot thriller and an intimately character-driven story that builds suspense, drama, and emotion in equal measure. For its uniquely character-driven scope and new, authentic ways to grip the viewer in thrill and suspense that are completely creative from Nolan, I consider it Nolan's best film (and I never thought anything of his could top ""Inception"" and ""The Dark Knight."") I cannot recommend it highly enough to patient and sophisticated film lovers. 10/10Note: I saw the film in The Big Show, Alamo Drafthouse's premium large format screen. This was an outstanding Big Show presentation, with the film's aspect ratio fully utilizing the entire screen and utterly flawless use of the Dolby Atmos sound system (even causing the seats to rumble at times, similar to Dolby Cinema screens at AMC.) This is a must-see in an excellent premium large format screen...but if you're a Nolan fan, do you even need me to tell you that?"
"There is not a single thing I didn't like in this film.I haven't seen it in IMAX because I didn't have an IMAX theater near me but I saw it in Dolby Atmos theater. My number #1 favorite film is Oppenheimer! I haven't seen Barbie yet but I think Oppenheimer should win Barbie at box office. Christopher Nolan inspired me to become a movie director one day. The movie has a fantastic cast. Believe me but this movie will win multiple Academy Awards including best picture, best director Christopher Nolan, best actor for Cillian Murphy, and maybe supporting actors and actresses for Robert Downer Jr., Matt Damon and Emily Blunt. Cillian Murphy's performance was brilliant.Barbie might win Barbenheimer battle but Oppenheimer will always be a better movie and will win definitely win multiple Academy Awards!Oppenheimer is the most important person in the history of the world and I thank Christopher Nolan for making this movie."
"Even though Oppenheimer is far more cohesive and easy-to-appreciate than the divisive Tenet, the two films still share many Nolanisms: the ticking time-bomb scenario, scientific exposition, an intense, panic attack-inducing soundtrack (this is very much a sound-driven film), non-linear storytelling. How Oppenheimer varies from Tenet, and why it's a better film, has something to do with the acting. Cillian Murphy embodies Oppenheimer to the degree that it's impossible to imagine anyone else in the role, and he's buttressed by an impressive ensemble cast including Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr (what might have been...had he not devoted the best years of his life to Marvel), and many others who will certainly look familiar, meriting a visit to the Wikipedia cast list. It even becomes difficult to keep track of all these characters. Oddly enough there is no Michael Caine.Another point of improvement over Tenet comes, ironically, from the fact that Nolan is reforming what is by now the most stale and unremarkable Hollywood genre of all: the biopic. Oppenheimer has a better idea of what kind of film it is, what story it wants to tell, and how to tell it.That being said, there is something missing in the depiction of Oppenheimer's moral quandary; much like in Luhrmann's recent 'Elvis', the film lacks the knowledge (maybe strength?) to give its protagonist the truly moving, epic/tragic dimension he deserves. The difference is that where Luhrmann was immoral (his Elvis was by turns redeemed and destroyed by profligacy) Nolan is more amoral (generally concerned with physics and technicalities over emotional resonance). Murphy completely sells Oppenheimer's horror at what he's created, but when the film switches to McCarthyist machinations it's anticlimactic, almost beside the point, proving that Nolan is more awestruck by the effects of the Bomb on humanity as a whole instead of on one man. It still works dramatically, (and Nolan's position is far more understandable than Luhrmann's) but, much like in real life, Oppenheimer himself gets a little lost in the magnitude of his work. You feel his pain, understand him, but are not emotionally moved---history merely marches on. It should come as no surprise that Emily Blunt, playing his wife, feels underutilized.Putting all that aside, a striking feature of the film is Nolan's restraint: any other director would be desperate to spice the film up with violence and destruction, but we watch Cillian Murphy's reactions. The real climax of the movie is not Hiroshima, but the Trinity test, and it's here that the old cliche 'it must be seen in the theater' holds true. This scene HAS to be experienced on a huge screen to get the full effect. Home viewing or streaming will not come close to what I sat through in the IMAX theater, and I'll leave it at that.Ultimately Oppenheimer is still a singular, worthwhile experience which I plan to see again in the theater. It goes without saying that it's a better film than the more popular 'Barbie', a movie so ridiculous that even its supporters contradict themselves, saying 'It's just a movie about a doll! You can't take it seriously!' and a few sentences later: 'subversive masterpiece!' Out of these two films, infamously released on the same day, it's easy to tell which one will endure.Another quibble, coming at the expense of sounding too snobbish: Nolan and cinematographer Hoytema are far too obsessed with soft-focus compositions, which make up nearly every shot in the film. The innovative black and white Imax film looks incredible of course, but what's the point if it's shot in the same woozy fashion as the color sequences? One of the main effects of black and white film is an emphasis on shapes, forms, and position, which is how directors such as Orson Welles and John Frankenheimer were able to work such wonders with it. Nolan could have blocked his scenes more creatively and found something even more visually stunning than the practical effect nuclear explosion, but his depth of field is so narrow that it can barely allow two things to be in focus at the same time. This works when we're meant to be getting inside Oppenheimer's head, but for the entire movie?"
"Having seen every single one of Nolan's films and considering him the G. O. A. T. I've been waiting for this movie for over a year. Sadly, I was left incredibly underwhelmed. It started slow and boring and stayed here pretty much the whole movie. There was nothing compelling that happened at all. I know it's as a biopic, but this is Nolan...and where some criticize Tenet for doing too much, he did far too little here. I did not feel emotionally connected to any of the characters, they did not develop the conflict he was alleged to have felt, it was so difficult to understand the actors at times due to low speaking, poor accents and ridiculously loud bursts of music and sound, and it was about 45-60 minutes too long with dialogue in many places that not progress the storyline in any substantive way nor was it interesting. The only thing that kept me awake as long as I did was that the movie jumps around between around 3-4 different time periods while telling Oppenheimer's story. But you could spend 30 min on Google and get the same information you get from this movie or watch any of then various documentaries out there and get more excitement.Was this a bad movie? No, not in the least. But the hype around this movie centered on 3 things: 1) Nolan, 2) His take on Oppenheimer, and 3) The start studded cast. Only the latter delivered, and having seen the movie I now understand why so many A and well liked B list actors were needed."
"This is one of the most amazing and fascinating stories ever - the development of the atomic bomb. Unfortunately, Christopher Nolan has chosen not to tell it. Instead, he has adapted the biography 'American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer' by Kai Bird. As chris2004 comments in an Amazon review of that book, 'I was looking forward to this book thinking it might go into the detail of the Manhattan project, the science around how the bomb was made, and Oppenheimer's contribution, as ""father of the bomb"". The book though only spends a brief time reviewing his work at Los Alamos and virtually nothing of his scientific work. Most of the other 500 pages just revolve around his social activities and, later on, the actions of the American Government to determine whether he was a Communist spy. A rather tedious read in the end. I can't imagine how they managed to make this into a film.' Indeed.The start, and much of the first two hours in flashback/flashforward are spent in interminable post-Trinity hearings where Oppenheimer is being persecuted for his alleged communist sympathies and connections. We get subjected to a beyond-tedious web of politics, egos, tale-telling and allegations, much of which is concerned with the pre-emptively answered question of whether an essentially retired physicist should keep his security clearance.The cinematography and acting performances are superb. Oppenheimer's back-story, relationships and moral dilemmas are well-handled. The most gripping parts of the movie are the re-creation of 1940s America and the development of Los Alamos. Sadly, opportunities to explain how the technical challenges of developing the atomic bomb were overcome are completely lost. For example, Oppenheimer leads a meeting of developers and mentions the relative required critical masses of uranium-23? Versus plutonium in about one sentence and five seconds. In later sequences, we see two containers slowly fill up with marbles as the elements are obtained. Drawings showing how the fissile materials are compacted together are briefly shown, but never explained. The movie shows presumably accurate models of the atomic bomb components, but again, there are no discussions of the actual physics. All we get are incomprehensible flashes of abstruse equations. We don't even get told whether the first atomic bombs used uranium or plutonium. That's how much prominence the science gets.The climax, the test-firing of the first atomic bomb, Trinity, occurs after two hours. The following hour is composed entirely of black-and-white committee hearings. What a wasted opportunity!"
"This is one of the best movies I have seen in my life so far.I have seen it in IMAX format, it was the ride of a lifetime, the effects are spot on, the sounds are terrifying it feels like you are there part of the action of the movie.The pacing is very dynamic and there is a lot to take in as the story progresses. Actors have brought the best in this movie, you forget they are actors and start to believe the existence of the characters.In conclusion this is a must watch movie that will go in history as the best movie ever made in this decade.My recommendation is to watch it in IMAX, for the best experience."
"I found the movie very disturbing. Oppenheimer is very enthusiastic about the development of the atomic bomb. It's obvious what can be done with this bomb. But it's not until much later that he realizes the horror of what he's doing. After he learns that children are dying! How convincing. I watched in horror as people applauded wildly when they learned about the devastation caused to the civilian population by the bombs dropped on Japan. I hope these images are just from an ordinary scenario. Murphy's acting is superb. I'll be surprised if he doesn't get nominated for an Oscar. I was horrified to watch this attack on the civilian population, which was not guilty of any crime in the history of the world, in the cinema. Not a movie for the summer months. I don't think it's Nolan's best movie either. But if you have an extra three hours, you can watch it."
"I need to make two things clear. One, this film is not for everyone and certainly wouldn't appeal to more casual movie goers. It is an in-depth character study of Oppenheimer and is entirely about his life and is not a film about the bomb. If you wanted a thriller about the trinity test this film is not it, they don't start making the bomb until nearly an hour into the film, with the actual test happening with about an hour left of the film. The film isn't particularly exciting either but very interesting and definitely entertaining. It is thought-provoking not action-packed.The other thing I need to make clear is that I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan. I don't think he has made a bad film or even just okay film in his entire career (granted I haven't yet seen Following or Insomnia). I enjoyed Tenet even though it was too confusing and liked Dark Knight Rises despite its plot holes. So it isn't a stretch to say I would have liked this film whether it was deemed good or bad by most people. I also had astronomical expectations for this film. I admittedly got carried away with the hype which is something people shouldn't do because the majority of times the movie, game or whatever it is isn't going to be as good as your unreasonable expectations. Which is why I'm glad to say Oppenheimer met my expectations. Is it a masterpiece? I don't know, that phrase is thrown around too much, but it is one of the best films I've ever watched and a film like no other I had seen before.The pacing of this film is ridiculous. It's at a running pace the entire film and at times feels like the flow of a trailer. This is not a bad thing. Everything important you need to know is very hard to miss. That said, you do need your entire brain focusing on this film to take it all in and appreciate it. The speed of the film means it never feels too long like The Hobbit films and actual flies by quite quickly. I have only seen the film once but I am planning to go again and I can guarantee I will find more details and understand the story more in my second maybe third viewing. But you don't need to watch the film multiple times to understand it, like I said before everything is made very clear what is happening, just make sure your listening to the dialogue.This film is completely made up of dialogue, there is no action in the entire film. Some people would find this boring which is understandable. The dialogue is very well written and is delivered perfectly by all the actors, there's nothing more I can say really. But one important thing to mention is the sound mixing. This was a huge complaint for Tenet, rightfully so, and I saw some people saying the issue was present in Oppenheimer as well. For me it was fine. I saw it at the BFI Imax and there were something like two lines of dialogue I struggled to hear (I have since watched the film again at a different cinema and I defiantly struggled to hear the dialogue at the start of the film). Most people seemed to be complaining about the start being hard to hear but it was fine for me.A lot of people in the promotion of this film have said that this is the ultimate film to see in Imax. Whilst I don't disagree, the best way to see this film is on 70mm Imax and there are plenty of truly wow moments seeing it on a screen that big, I don't think it is as necessary as implied. Although I didn't see it in Imax, Interstellar seems like it would be a much better film for Imax than Oppenheimer. This doesn't mean you shouldn't see it at the biggest screen you can. Watching it at the BFI Imax was an unreal experience and you truly get immersed with the stunning cinematography and the booming score.Ludwig Goransson's score is his best yet. It compliments the film perfectly. I find it a bit hard to describe it without going needlessly in depth on all the musical features that make it so good. Lots of people has wanted Hans Zimmer and Nolan to continue working together again. I love Zimmer's work and have seen his performances live but I can assure you that Goransson is an amazing composer as well and could definitely be the next big film composer for the years to come.The cast is ridiculous as well. The cast is completely stacked with Cillian Murphy, RDJ, Matt Damon (who came out of a break from acting when he got the call from Nolan), Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh. There are big name actors who have just a few lines in the entire film some of them only being in a single scene, Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, Matthew Modine, Casey Affleck. Cillian Murphy is perfect as Oppenheimer, not only do they loom alike but he also really conveys the emotions and regret that Oppenheimer faced. Robert Downey Jr. Also gives an amazing performance but not quite as good as some people are making it out to be. Don't get me wrong he is amazing I just feel like Emily Blunt is the best supporting actor. There is one moment near the end where she very nearly steals the show and is probably one of my favourite moments in the film.As in every film that involves science, when they explain a lot of it goes over your head. I was surprised to see that Oppenheimer handled that complicated science aspect really well. I have little knowledge of quantum physics just the very basics and I found myself understanding what they are saying at a simple level. They never dive in deep explaining the tricky stuff as well which is really good for the audience. I don't know if it was just me that found the science possible to grasp at and understand.The structure of the film can be slightly confusing. In typical Nolan style, it is non-linear. Three distinct parts of Oppenheimer's story are told throughout the film. One part is black and white, after the trinity test. Another is in what is effectively a court room but not technically one. And the other part which takes up the majority of the film is the chronological events of Oppenheimer's life. It is fairly easy to follow but there are a few black and white scenes that you can't obviously tell when they happened. One thing I liked that they did was that as the chronological life of Oppenheimer caught up to the black and white scenes after the bomb it would become colour. Its a nice touch that helps you understand what is going on.You can't talk about the film without mentioning the bomb. It is the climax of the film and the countdown to its detonation is so well done. The tension, dread, worry that everyone feels is very effectively portrayed to the point where I think the build up the bomb is better than the actual explosion. The explosion is by far the best nuke scene I have seen in a movie but I think the build-up is better in terms of the effect it has on you. The explosion itself is definitely the best looking nuke I have ever seen, with the film benefiting from Nolan's practical effects. At the time of the explosion you just feel this terrified awe as the perfectly shot bomb goes off. There's also a bit of a jump scare in this bit that took me by surprise.I could talk about more but I would be spoiling the movie. Thank you for taking the time to read my review, have a great day.I have now watched the film a second time in a smaller cinema and it was just as good an experience as the first time. The film is definitely better in IMAX now I can compare to a regular screen."
"If you wish to argue in favour of Christopher Nolan being one of the visionary filmmakers of this era with a bunch of people, take them to an IMAX screening of Oppenheimer. After the sci-fi overdose that was Tenet, Nolan chooses to tell the story of the theoretical physicist whose name has nearly become synonymous with the atomic bomb. This is a man who had ambitions of epic proportions, and he had his distinct ways of getting there. The film takes you through significant events in the life of the titular protagonist, told in a non-linear style. It's almost like two parts of a single story running into each other from opposite directions (like a chemical reaction), eventually converging at a pivotal confrontation scene featuring Robert J Oppenheimer, Lewis Strauss, and Albert Einstein. This particular scene carries so much emotional heft when it unfurls at the very end, even when we get to see it play out from another angle early on. And that's just one of many such incredible instances of fantastic storytelling we see in the film!Cillian Murphy is someone who lets his eyes do much of the talking in the later acts, and he's absolutely splendid. There's a particular scene of him delivering a hallucinatory speech; the way Nolan stages it and how Cillian cracks open his saturated mind and lets us in - something you'll never forget! RDJ, as the friendly colleague turned eventual adversary of Oppenheimer, puts in one of his best performances to date. The changing camaraderie between RDJ's and Alden Ehrenreich's characters in the final act is incredible to watch. In fact, everything that unravels post the Trinity test is fast-paced, rich in details, and making you marvel at the audio-visual output Nolan and team have achieved. Emily Blunt also shines in the final act where she goes totally bonkers. Credit where it's due, the cast is mostly A-list and spot-on in their respective roles.I'm truly awestruck by the efforts that have gone into the visual side - Hoyte Van Hoytema's frames keep switching between various aspect ratios, colours, and elements of focus (including close-ups of Cillian's face). Practically creating the effects required for the explosion sequence would've been such a task. [Also, special kudos to the folks at DNEG.] How the film manages to strike the appropriate emotional chords and raise tension levels leading up to the Trinity Test sequence wouldn't have been achieved to this extent, if not for Ludwig Göransson's immersive score. Jennifer Lame's cuts give it definitive coherence, not for once letting us tune out of Oppenheimer's eventful journey."
"A spectacular film, one of the best motion pictures that was ever shot. The soundtrack of the movie was insane, it is three hours but you don't feel it because it is exciting from the start till the end, the cast was amazing, everyone of them did his role with perfect performance. Christopher Nolan did an amazing job directing Oppenheimer. The way he tells the story of doctor Robert was fantastic, they were able to make everyone in the theater so excited throughout the movie which is mainly focusing on politics without any action scenes and that's really incredible. I believe that this movie is the best cinema experience in history."
"A truly surreal experience about the world we're living in and the horrifying possibility of a doomsday.This movie has a pretty good chance of winning Best Picture and Best Director at the Academy Awards when it goes to war with Scorsese's Killere of the Flower Moon. It'll be a battle for the ages!As far as Cillian Murphy is concerned, I wholeheartedly hope that he wins the Oscar for Best Actor because he has absolutely killed it in his role as the father of the atomic bomb, easily the standout performance of the year so far and I'm confident it'll stay that way.Also the entire supporting cast was fantastic, especially RDJ and Emily Blunt. These two truly shine in their respective roles.This is what true cinema is all about.Nolan has done it again!"
"We know that the bomb worked. We know history. But the weeds of it, we do not.The writing, the acting, and, most of all, the restraint made this movie into a trie masterpiece.And I really do want to emphasize the restraint in my review. A studio exec or a less experienced director could have added in a scene where the bomb actually gets used In Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They would have made a spectacle out of it with CGI.But Nolan did not. Nolan trusted his writing and the ability of the actors to deliver the guttural horror of the atomic destruction in relative silence. Even without showing the physical destruction, the destructive nature of the weapon becomes too clear in more ways than one.After you see the movie, you truly realize that it was destructive to humanity in more ways than one. You get the sense that it was a spiritual and moral destruction, a blasphememous grasp at power.Now, thee movie doesn't say all that in a speech. But the acting and the writing makes it too clear.A phenomenal movie that all should watch."
"This was one of the most anticipated films of the year. Because everyone misses Cinema, and great film making. We all know that Christopher Nolan never makes a bad movie, but we still wanted to know how he would tell a story that most people know his way.The film was brilliant technically, the camera work, production design, sound everything technical just worked. And what impressed the most was shooting scenes in Black&White instead of doing it in post, and it looked fantastic.The acting was absolutely amazing, if Cillian Murphy or RDJ do not win or at least get nominated during award season I would lose faith in the Academy Awards. The rest of the supporting cast was brilliant and in tune with their characters.The story was documentary style drama, with Nolan's typical convoluted time jumps. It was hard to follow in some parts, you really needed to keep up the entire run time. It might be off-putting for people that are not familiar with Nolan's work.The Sound was also loud again, and the dialog was on the low end. I got to like it now that he has explained why he arranges his sound in that manner. And the scoring was just perfect, I never pay attention to the Sound but in this one I did because it literally blasts you.This was a great film, but like any other Nolan film it requires a second viewing. I would highly recommend that you see it in an IMAX Cinema/Theatre."
"This is the second film of Nolan's I have watched that features historical events and characters. For such a monumental slice of human history, this movie fails to emphasize the most important bits. It most certainly did not scratch the itch that I had developed when I found out it existed!Nolan works wonders when he handles original ideas and Batman films. However, I have been disappointed too many times by him forcing originality into things that people are already familiar with.Chris, sometimes we just want to see historical events visualized outside the documentary format. You don't need to try to prove how intelligent you are in every movie you make... You're butchering history just like Netflix does. Just, in a different way... I'm just disappointed that this wasted opportunity will now discourage others from making an Oppenheimer/Manhattan Project movie because it will have been already made. Or has it?"
"The story is simply not for Nolan. He did great with Inception, Interstellar, Memento, Batman, but the A-Bomb story is not the right material for his style storytelling.Endless mix of short phrases, never getting deep enough in the essence, jumping back and forth in time, shallow characters, ...
too cheap.Everyone's applauding, but why? Because of Nolan's name? Cast? The underlying story? Or just trying to appear intellectual rather than admit that ""the king is naked"" ?There is nothing intellectual in this movie, just the beaten pass of thriller-telling, the A-Bomb story is more complex deeper and deserves better."
"This was genuinely without a doubt the first movie I witnessed that made experience and sink away and forget everything around me.The sounds, the shots.. the double story that goes at the same time. I want to watch it again.Seeing Albert Einstein made me so happy for reasons I don't understand. And only near the end I realised Strauss is Robert Downey Jr.Great cast led by one of my favorite actors nowadays. So maybe I'm a bit biased.A movie like this makes me so happy I'm alive and greatly enjoy and experience emotions when I'm in the cinema. That I don't care that I show emotions in cinema. Crying laughter or just hapiness."
"I will reluctantly give it a perfect score even though I think it's the most straight forward Nolan film.The trouble I seem to have with it is that I wished it was more creative, more memorable. I give it credit that for a 180 minute, dialogue-heavy film it wasn't boring a bit but it could have taken more creative risks. The bomb was not as memorable as I imagined it would be. Where is that Lynch level atomic bomb? Where is the imagery that will remain with you? Florence Pugh is not enough, you naughty. The bomb should have been bigger and maybe even CG.Acting wise, it was the strong part of the film. Cillian Murphy is really acting his role to its potential but Robert Downey is out-acting him. I respect that. But beside both of them we have a big cast full of talent and the script itself was excellent and the delivery very nice. Proof was in the fact 3 hours flew by.Even with I wished it's still a very well made film, a epic one that will get another rewatch from me but not many, as I wished."
"Nolan's Oppenheimer barely qualifies as a biopic, at least not the thudding Hollywood variety. Instead it's a movie - a masterful one, among his best - investigating the nature of power: how it is created, how it is kept in balance, and how it leads people into murky quandaries that refuse simplistic answers.The three-hour historical biopic Oppenheimer is a gorgeously photographed, brilliantly acted, masterfully edited and thoroughly engrossing epic that instantly takes its place among the finest films of this decade - an old-fashioned yet cutting-edge work that should resonate with film scholars and popcorn-toting mainstream movie lovers for years and decades to come. Although it might be boring to a certain group of audience, Oppenheimer is for everyone, except those who never dwelved much into the director's finest filmography and what he brings to the screen.Every character seemed like a mirror to their original counterpart while portraying them. Cillian Murphy was nothing less than being an absolute pleasure to watch. The biography fully embraces the contradictions of an intellectual giant who was also a deeply flawed man, his legacy complicated by his own ambivalence toward the breakthrough achievement that secured his place in the history books. Most mature film by the director with an already finest filmography throughout his career, Oppenheimer joins and becomes a distinctive feature, which feels different from Nolan's other movies (with regards to genre) while feeling the same on many aspects (with regards to direction, trademarks)My Rating : 10/10."
"Christopher Nolan has once again created a thought-provoking and visually stunning film with Oppenheimer. Drawing from extensive source material and interviews with those who knew Oppenheimer personally, Nolan crafts a complex and moving portrayal of the scientist tormented by the implications of his scientific discoveries.Cillian Murphy gives a nuanced and sympathetic performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer, capturing both his intellectual brilliance and inner turmoil. The ensemble cast is fantastic across the board, with standout performances from Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss and Emily Blunt as Jean Tatlock.Nolan uses his trademark visual style to make the scientific concepts and events come to life in an immediately vivid and engaging way. The wartime New Mexico scenes perfectly capture the tension and urgency of the Manhattan Project, while the scenes set in Princeton transport the viewer back to 1930s academia.Above all, Oppenheimer provokes important questions that remain relevant today. It examines the responsibilities that come with scientific progress and the line between scientific necessity and moral choice. While portraying Oppenheimer sympathetically, the film doesn't shy away from the difficult realities of the atomic bombings and their lasting effects.Christopher Nolan once again pushes the boundaries of what can be achieved in blockbuster filmmaking with Oppenheimer. Cillian Murphy brings humanity and nuance to the titular character in a performance that will likely be remembered for some time. Fans of Nolan and of thought-provoking historical dramas will find a lot to appreciate in Oppenheimer."""
"Another masterpiece by Nolan. This is easily one of the best movie in the decade.I couldn't talk about this movie without mentioning the briliant performance by Cillian Murphy. He aced the role to perfection. RDJ and Emily Blunt delivered a great performance as the Patriotic American, Lewis Strauss and Kitty Oppenheimer .Every actor did a great job.Score by Ludwig Göransson was absolutely flawless. It was perfectly able to grasp the tension between scenes. Another great thing about Nolan is , he knows how to use silence and he really made perfect use of the silence in this movie.Overall , this biography drama is a must watch and you should really watch it in the theatres. You will not feel the 3hr period of the Movie."
"If you're going into this movie with the expectation of being entertained by lots of explosions, comedy, and filler screen time, you will be disappointed. This is a visual story. Its very intellectually created & exceptionally well timed out. Given that it's a 3 hour movie it does a wonderful job allowing the viewer to build a relationship with the main character to fully understand Oppeinheimers trials and tribulations and to understand what motivated him & shaped what would later become his viewpoint on the entire creation of the atomic bomb and overall criticism of the US Military's decisions. Another 10/10 for C. Nolan!"
"So Oppenheimer didn't disappoint. Prepare for a relentlessly tense three hour investment with ample exposition and borderline horror tropes. Also prepare for a Titanic-style treasure trove of Oscars come award season. Cillian already has one hand on his statue, while Nolan will surely take home Best Film and Director. Downey might also sneak a Best Supporting. But the true master here is Ludwig Goransson, whose score ensures the exposition is never boring, amping up the tension to unbearable levels of dread. Couldn't believe it wasn't Hans Zimmer when I looked it up. Add the unbelievable sound mix and Oppenheimer is terrifyingly unsettling. It has all the hallmarks of classic docudramas like JFK and 13 Days, with MTV editing and time jumps, but is a superior film that must be seen on a big screen, preferably IMAX. Awesome 10/10."

"For those of you expecting massive explosions and thundering sounds of the bombs dropped on the two cities will be sorely disappointed. Overall a great movie spending great amount of time and detail exploring the psyche behind the creator of the Atomic bomb. Science nerds will catch on to same major name drops besides Einstein and be responsible to explain to the normies what ""Nuclear Fission"" means.Cillian Murphy's acting was beyond par and there is no doubt if anyone else could have replaced him on the role. The movie explores the politics in the background of the world war - both government and professional.My honest feedback for those about to watch would be to not buy into the hype of watching it in IMAX for the ""Perfect experience"" because this movie can be watched on a standard screen just as well. In fact I would say even better because a lot of the dialogue gets lost between the bass coming from the IMAX speakers."
"I think people are confusing ""a good story"" with a good movie. If you want the story, go to a library and read about the real life events. No matter what moment you skip to in this movie, it's a bunch of guys in suits sitting around a table. There are a few scenes that have small exposure to something other than men in suits in an office or sitting in a meeting, but it was over hype on the actual production quality, lacking a variety in set design and story inclusion beyond repetitive generic settings. The acting is decent, it just felt like a lot was missing to capture the full spectrum of emercing the audience in the time period of the movie and other aspects that could have been filmed to create a more comprehensive image. I could have enjoyed this movie as much by simply reading the script."
"Oppenheimer: The Manhattan Project is central to this film but it is also about how Oppenheimer's intellectual development, his life and loves. Cillian Murphy is devastating in his portrayal of the great scientist whose mind was wracked with strange thoughts of the stars and of the Quantum World, a womaniser, drinker, chain smoker. Great luminaries like Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighöfer), Nils Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) and Einstein (Tom Conti) have walk on parts or cameos. The Einstein cameo proves to be central to the films narrative though. The film unfolds through two hearing and Oppenheimer's career progression on to being Director of the Manhattan Project. The hearing on Oppenheimer's security clearance in 1954 shows how he was deserted by many friends and colleagues but also uncovers the Iago behind this assault on his integrity. In ways Oppenheimer was his own worst enemy, careless in his choice of friends and too quick to make enemies. There are too many characters to cover in any one review but Emily Blunt puts in a creditable performance as Kitty Oppenheimer, having to hold things together, putting her life as a botanist on hold. General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) stood by Oppenheimer in 1954 but their relationship is portrayed as being stormy during the Los Alamos years, fights over security clearances for other scientists and even Oppenheimer himself due to past political associations. We even get to see Oppenheimer's involvement in unionising scientists. Even though we know the outcome the tension builds as the Trinity Test approaches. Fermi (Danny Deferrari) makes book on how may kilotonnes the explosion will be with a side bet on the atmosphere igniting. A tale of victory, betrayal but also of how scientists had differing opinions on the use of atomic weapons and the post war use of atomic energy. The two hearings head towards a conclusion just as the Manhattan Project does, all three resulting in different levels of destruction. Written and Directed by Christopher Nolan. 9/10."
"I went to see Barbenheimer with high hopes for this because I've been anticipating it since it was announced and this was truly the most excited I'd had been for a film in a while. My best friend had done Barbenheimer a few days before and told me to watch Oppenheimer before Barbie, but I'm starting to deeply regret that decision. Oppenheimer was so incredible that the bar was set tens of thousands of kilometres into the sky, which probably made me enjoy Barbie much less than I would've on it's own. I was still processing this masterpiece even when all the Kens went to all out beach war.There isn't one bad thing I can say about this film. I'm truly stunned at the passion, dedication and effort put into this absolute masterclass in film-making. The film is 3 hours long but none of the scenes are boring, quite the contrary, and it goes by much faster. The camera work and lighting is absolutely phenomenal, which really isn't surprising when Hoyte van Hoytema is your cinematographer. The use of extremely bright lights to mimic the explosion of the bomb, as well as to convey a feeling of anxiety, panic and guilt is incredibly well thought out and used extremely appropriately. The performances are also out of this world : Emily Blunt is extraordinary, Robert Downey Jr. Is amazing, Matt Damon is great, David Krumholtz is so fun to watch, Benny Safdie is dramatic but not to the point of being melodramatic and delivers a great performance, Florence Pugh really delivers as well, and not to mention Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, which is, in my humble opinion, one of the best and most well-casted performances of all time. The writing is phenomenal, the character work is phenomenal, the soundtrack is phenomenal, the cinematography is phenomenal ; what more can I say except that Oppenheimer is truly one of the most breathtaking pieces of media ever made."
"I love when a biopic doesn't play it safe. Having very little knowledge of the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, I was very interested in how his studies eventually lead to the creation of the atomic bomb. Being directed by Christopher Nolan, I was already going to check out the film, but it also exceeded my expectations. This is filmmaking in its purest form (especially today). Here's why I believe this excellent film deserves to be seen in theatres.Essentially, Oppenheimer is about the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) and his influence in making the atomic bomb, but the way the film is structured makes it feel like so much more. Told in non-linear fashion, the audience is shown the trial afterwards, the planning beforehand, and the event itself. The majority of the film is a series of scenes with people talking in rooms, which may not seem all that exciting or appealing, but score did wonders for that. Many people complain about Christopher Nolan's films being frustrating in terms of hearing the dialogue, but I never felt that here and the bombastic score sucked me in even more. I was on the edge of my seat for the entire three hour run time.As always, Nolan directs the hell out of this film and brought out probably the best performance in Cillian Murphy's entire career. His performance is worth the price of admission alone. On top of that though, Robert Downey Jr. Also gives one of the best performances of his career in my opinion. Their scenes together were electric. Oppenheimer is also filled with endless celebrity cameos, but that just goes to show how badly everyone clearly loves working with Nolan. From the cast to the direction, from the score to the fact that there were no CGI shots, everything about this film was remarkably done.Oppenheimer is one of my favourite films of 2023 and it may just end up becoming my favourite after a second viewing. I was also blown away that the point of the film isn't really about the bomb itself, but rather Oppenheimer's life and how this bomb is such a negative thing in our world. It's eye-opening in ways I wasn't expecting and the screenplay only furthered that. With an insane amount of terrific dialogue that all flies at you at a mile-a-minute, I never once felt an ounce of boredom. I loved this film from start to finish and you can now catch it in theatres. Highly, highly recommended."
"I've honestly never been a huge fan of Christopher Nolan, and I will admit that I haven't seen a lot of his more popular movies (with the exception of The Dark Knight trilogy). From what I know about Nolan's work is how unique the editing is in his films, and you can kinda tell from the odd editing choices, specifically when Oppenheimer would hallucinate. While I do see how that kind of style can better develop Oppenheimer's character by visually showing us how he is feeling, I can see how this can be bothersome to some people. Personally, I really enjoyed it.I will say that this movie is really fast paced despite its three hour run time, and with that being said, it can be hard to follow at times. I'll admit that there were some scenes that just shove information down the audiences throat, and as someone who has ADHD it took me a while to catch up to what was happening in the story, and it doesn't help that Nolan likes to skip through time numerous times throughout the film (but then again, it did help that they had a balanced mixture of black and white scenes and colored scenes.While I do think this film is fast paced, I think the story did take that pace away from me with how the story was told. To clarify, there seemed to have been a climatic ending halfway into the film, but instead of ending, more consistencies rise and thus, more conflict needs to be resolved. Usually I hate when movies do this, but I oddly enjoyed the final act a lot more than the ""climax"" in the middle of the film.What people need to understand about this film is that it isn't about the bomb, well, it is, but most of the movie focuses on Oppenheimer's life leading up to him making the bomb, and the aftermath of what his creation has done after America bombed Japan. I thought they really told a great story here, and Oppenheimer, as well as many other characters in this film were written very well.Most of the film consists on talking, so if you're ere expecting a full-blown war movie, don't have that in your mind at all when you walk into this film. I recommend this to any history movie-goers, as it's pretty informative about Oppenheimer's life leading up to the creation of the bomb that practically ended World War II."
"Absolutely loved the Movie from start to finish!It felt as if I was truly transported back to the 1930s and 40s. Great character and costume design. The casting of this epic has been magnificent. The writing is very powerful and symbolic. For a student of science like me, watching these big names of Physics being mentioned and used as plot points was really cool.The sheer elegance of the way Cilian Murphy portrays the scientist whose other worldly genius is almost tormenting his soul is truly an Oscar worthy performance. Known for his famous soulless stare in the Peaky Blinders, Cilian Murphy's Oppenheimer stare feels ached, his eyes act to convey the incredible inner turmoil this man has endured.Another performance I would love to single out is Robert Downey Jr, he is phenomenal as Lewis Strauss. His nuanced performance certainly deserves an Oscar nomination at the least.Matt Damon and Rami Malek are great in their respective parts. At times I had trouble reminding myself that it's not General Groves, it's Matt Damon!Nolan's direction shines through it all . With the use of practical special effects and low CGI, the movie seems a bit too realistic at times. The victories, the losses and the betrayals feel all too personal. Nolan's use of B&W to denote seperate times and contexts feels brilliant. The background score is beautiful and haunting at the same time.It's not all roses sadly, it feels like a lot of info crammed into 3 hours. Felt like it could have been a 2 part series. The nonlinear story telling maybe offputting to many. Oppenheimer's final fate is not touched upon. At least a small infographic in the end showing ""where they are now/what happened to them"" would've helped a lot.All in all, a solid film to watch for any movie enthusiast!"
"This movie is a masterpiece for which I still have hope for movies. I did not blink the whole 3 hours. Have to watch it again. And again. Acting is exceptional, Murphy especially delivers human nature and emotions on a whole new level, and some scenes keep you on edge of your seat. Truly one of the best movies I have ever watched. I feel like I have to watch it a few more times because there are so many details and emotions you can easily miss if you just blink for a second. Can't wait to see it again. Please make this kind of movies more. Smart, educating, and worth my time and money. Thank you."
"Oppenheimer is a monumental cinematic achievement by Christopher Nolan! A deep dive character study(biopic) into a man who historically changed the world forever and how masterfully crafted!By far this is Nolan's least 'action' film that warrants lots of attention, there is no CGI but lots of conversations going on.. took his time to build the plot(kept it intense) then blast off ! The last hour was a gripping tale of the conscience of mankind and 3hours just flew by...Cillian Murphy was excellent as Robert Oppenheimer and Robert Downey Jr delivered an Oscar-worthy performance with the superb supporting cast all around! Terrific sound designs and Goransson haunting score was amazing!All this while watching Nolan movies and his filmmaking over the years, I thought he is someone god-tier level but after watched that ending of Oppenheimer tonight, I'm fairly convinced that he is the god ! Cinema at its peak!#Oppenheimer."
"**Possible Spoilers Ahead**Oppenheimer is part-metaphysical film, part-courtroom drama, part-biopic, part-IMAX experience, all personal storytelling about one man who changed the history of the world. It's easily 2023's most important movie, but also its most devastating. It evokes the horrors of World War Two flawlessly even though we never see a single bullet flying on-screen (but don't think there's 100% clean imagery in this biopic). It gets down and dirty with Oppenheimer's life as an up-and-coming scientist changing the course of warfare itself (even if it was out of desperation to outpace the Nazis on the atom bomb front).Oppenheimer is a horror movie without any of the 'creeps and ghouls' gimmick; it's real-world history on The Manhattan Project, and that itself is never easy stuff to confront. It's 2023's defining World War Two film, and still relevant in regards to America's modern paranoia over Russia. At 3-hours it takes its time with all the personal, political and scientific stuff; and the sound design also helps make the experience feel 'atomic' and transcendent of the 'physical' story at play (especially the shots of the atoms themselves colliding and banging).Oppenheimer is a blockbuster that's not easygoing stuff by any stretch of the imagination, but it's certainly going to be remembered for generations to come thanks to Chris Nolan's spectacle and respect for J. Robert Oppenheimer himself.Oppenheimer leaves you feeling like... it says all it needs to say, yet it leaves you with dread that, did all this madness really end when The Manhattan Project itself ended? Did we end the world as we know it? The film implies... yes, we did.An uneasy experience but historically important and necessary for both cinema and history nuts alike. 5/5 stars. 10/10 IMDb points."
I'll start off by saying it is technically a good movie. The acting is good and the storytelling is good if a bit too quickly paced. It basically starts off at full speed and doesn't slow down. There wasn't really any suspension building in any scene except the bomb test. My biggest complaint is the intense background music that never stopped for more than a minute or two and it gets old pretty quick. In fact I contemplated leaving the theater because the constant dramatic music was driving me nuts. It's incessant and takes away from the film. This movie would have been a lot better if it had 50-75% less unnecessary background music.
I expected a thriller and ended up with a drawn out boring court case unfortunately. There are elements of the film which are entertaining but the film's third act is very dull and far too long.The trailer is brilliant and gives the impression of a fast paced movie.I just found myself looking at my watch too often and feeling frustrated by the end of the movie with how long conversations were taking.The positives are that the acting is of a very high quality at times and the movie is filmed very well.I am a Nolan fan and didn't want to write this review but the movie has been far overhyped.
"An absolutely stunning achievement in cinema. Nolan rarely disappoints and this is one of his finest. Cillian Murphy's performance was nothing short of brilliant, along with the supporting cast. The sheer horror of what they created in that desert and its impact on history is conveyed with tension and measure. This is a three hour film and it feels shorter. There wasn't a moment where I was bored or felt it was dragging on. Nolan is a master or practical effects over CGI and the trinity test scene was executed so well. Along with the Los Alamos victory speech. Stunning. Overall I give this exquisite film 10\10 and highly recommend!!!"
"It's now over 24 hours since the end credits rolled but I find myself still thinking about all the great things I loved about this movie. Often when leaving the cinema your on a high when you have had a good experience it's very easy to be over enthusiastic about how good something is. In this case, having has that time to reflect I cannot fault this film in any way, nor any of the cast on their performances.I confess to being a lover of Christopher Nolan films, the weirder the better e.g. Interstellar, Inception. I love the way he challenges the audience. I chose to see this on the IMAX with high hopes but wondering if his trademark style would work in a biopic. I was not disappointed. From the very first frame I was gripped and held in that grip right to the end credits. Three hours flew by, it felt like I had sat there for half of that time. There is no let up in the story telling, rattling along at a great pace without any moments to draw breath. (Warning: There is no time for a quick bathroom break in this one or you will miss something important)Cillian Murphy gives an outstanding performance in the lead, and if he not in possession of an Oscar for this by this time next year it will be a travesty. The Oscar's are suckers for giving Oscars to people who portray real people and IMHO very few are worthy of it, especially when it it was someone iconic that already k ow so much about. This would be deserving just purely from the standpoint of it being a great dramatic performance where every facet of Oppenheimers views and personality is in show, and etched in Cillian Murphys expression in every scene, often in extreme close up where there is no hiding.The supporting cast are all excellent. Any number could be Oscar nominees but special mention to arouse Downey Jr who has never been better.Surely Oscar nominations are coming to for Nolan for direction and screenplay and a slew of other technical categories, none more so than sound, the extra cost of the IMAX ticket was worth it for the sound alone.Go see it, and see it on the cinema. Don't take my word for it. Kai Bird one of the co authors of the book on which is this based is delighted with it. He is also certain that his co-author would also have been delighted with it were he still alive to see it. I simply cannot recall any biopic that has had me so enthralled from start to end."
"This is more or less a feature documentary type of a movie made only for people who have the basic knowledge of Oppenheimer and the first atomic bomb.The movie is NOT for people who'd rather watch an action-y type of a film nor for people who simply are not interested in this topic in general. The movie won't change their opinion.As a person who knows enough about the man and the first atomic bomb and who knew that the movie will be in the style of a ""documentary"" I was definitely the target audience and I am glad I saw the movie in cinema.With that being said the movie has no business being three hours long. There are so many scenes that kill the pacing and should have been cut. The movie should have been 2h30m maximum or they should have made a mini series if they wanted to properly explain all the ""side characters"" and certain events that happened during that time period."
"Experiencing a lot of emotions after walking out of the theatre. Anger after the final shots, then after 5 minutes of talking with people a feeling of love and admiration for this film and what it achieves. More truth about how the world works than anything I've ever seen. Greatest use of montage and music. Amazing editing. My favorite Christopher Nolan movie. It scared me. Some scenes are horrifying and literally shake you to your core especially with a powerful imax theatre.This movie made me cry twice especially after the bomb test scenes when they are adoring and cheering him. Not happy tears, mind you, despair. You may be angry if you understand the history (read the book) and the trajectory of military conflicts from then to today. Nothing has changed and it's incredibly moving and sad. Nolan is making a statement in the world we live in today as well. But after the film you feel joy at having experienced one of the greatest movies ever made. It's a masterpiece. When you are this immersed you aren't thinking about the acting or cast. It feels real. And that's magic."
"I watched this film in IMAX last night and it was amazing and the ending will shock you. I thought the sound design and cinematography was superb but the acting was even better. Cillian Murphy had a phenomenal performance and Robert Downy Jr. Was very good and stuck to his role. I have seen every single Nolan film, but they way he sees his films layered out is far different then other filmmakers of this generation. Oppenheimer is a brilliant piece of cinema directed by brilliant Christopher Nolan about a brilliant man named Oppenheimer. Yet the realization of the creation of this bomb made me feel scared. Oppenheimer will now not only be known as the man who created the atomic bomb, but the one who is will end the world as we know it. True masterpiece."
"The movie was amazing, but aren't all of Nolan's films? That's not what I'm hear to talk about though. As an avid movie goer I cannot emphasize how important it is to experience this film in IMAX. I have watched 100's of movies in IMAX and this is hands down the greatest one of all time. I could feel sound and pressure in my chest throughout the film. I was paralyzed in my seat until the final hour of the film.I watched it in my local IMAX theater, which is an amazing theater, but somehow I feel like I still did it a disservice because I didn't watch it in 70mm. Luckily there is one only 200 miles away in Dallas that I purchased a ticket for to see tomorrow.Again, Nolan's movies always have the best acting, cinematography, plots, pacing, etc.... This movie had something else beyond all the others."
"This is one of the biggest Nolan film I've ever seen since Batman begins , dark knight and dark knight rises, inception, Dunkirk and interstellar. Oppenheimer was absolutely well done and seeing Oppenheimer make the atomic bomb and asking Albert Einstein for advice on how the world will see how atomic bombs will impact wars and peoples lives . Nolan did a fantastic job getting the best people for universal Oppenheimer. Emily blunt Matt Damon , Robert Downey Jr Florence Pugh known for her role in Blackwidow was so outstanding playing the old love flame Oppenheimer really nailed it. But I wasn't surprised when she did the romance scenes will Cillian. But I'm very proud of her acting . Cillian Murphy was the perfect man for Oppenheimer. He captured the man very well I hope he plays another scientist in the next Nolan movie . It's been 18 15 to 11 years since he played scarecrow since the batman saga . But I never knew Oppenheimer was a ladies man which Im very very amazed and surprised. Nolan hasn't done anything like this since the 2000s or 2010s . But he deserves the credit for directing Oppenheimer which has changed Nolan's filming career . He hasn't done a 3hr movie like this . When peter Jackson directed lord of the rings saga the hobbit , King Kong were 3hr long movies which I'm used to watching. The filming in New Mexico perfect place film . Atomic bomb was very very amazing to see. But the explosions were absolutely awesome and very real to my eyes . The effects were so outstanding no cgi this time . When the atomic bomb went off It felt like I was gonna fly out . But I have to say I was so amazed of all the incredible work Nolan did . The filming was absolutely incredible. It was like traveling back in time . The black and white was so well done and very well documented. Nolan did a fantastic job following the stories of the year when ww2 was happening, and the whole world facing many changes and Oppenheimer trying to became the next man to outdo manhood god . When I see Oppenheimer the second time I'll see it on a bigger screen in imax with my cousin in Burbank and Santa Barbara with my dad . I hope to see the cast at the Santa Barbara film festival and I tell them you were absolutely fantastic in the movie. I hope to see Nolan , Cillian, Kenneth Branagh, Matt Damon , and the entire cast at the Santa Barbara film festival .Hopefully when it's released on 4k there's an extended edition with longer scenes with Oppenheimer and more scenes with people talking about the bomb and Oppenheimer having a longer moment with Jean , and hopefully I'll see behind the scenes of how Nolan made such a remarkable atomic bomb movie in cinema history and how the cast of Oppenheimer worked with Nolan and what impacted the world of the atomic bombs today.Christopher Nolan congratulations on a job well done directing Oppenheimer for universal. I hope he works with universal again for another project."
"Oppenheimer is the first film to come from Christopher Nolan's new journey in filmmaking by switching it up a bit to make probably one of the best biopics in the past decade. The story follows J. Robert Oppenheimer on a mission to help develop the atomic bomb that will affect the world as we know it, while also showing us the political dilemma that is caused by it, as well as the affect it has on himself and others close to him. Cillian Murphy as the title character J. Robert Oppenheimer gives probably the best performance of his career as well as one of the best performances of the year and I'm glad that Christopher Nolan finally gives him his time to shine after taking a backseat in Nolan's previous films throughout the years. Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer I thought fit her role well, although I wished we could of explored her character a bit more. Matt Damon as General Leslie Grooves Jr is a great addition to the supporting cast and is one of the best characters of the movie. Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss absolutely nails his role and also gives a great supporting performance in this film. Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock was also great, although I felt her role in the film was to be more absurd with Oppenheimer rather than supporting of him like I thought her character would be and I figured her character would of played a bigger role than what was anticipated, but overall, she was fantastic as always. The score for this film is probably one of the best scores I've heard since Nolan's The Dark Knight (2008) and the actual atomic bomb scene was incredible to watch. I also like how Christopher Nolan was able to give audiences insight and show how dangerous a atomic bomb can be and the affect it has on people. If there's any cons I have, the way sexuality/nudity is handled is a bit strange, but also I can see why it's handled that way and the third act starts to drag a bit, but other than that, there's not really much to complain about. Overall, Oppenheimer is not only probably one of the best films of 2023, but also one of the best biopics in the last decade that will be revisited for years to come."
"Nolan fails at a very basic but important technique in film. ""SHOW, don't tell"".They do a lot of talking in this film about the decisions, actions and the results of what goes on in the film - but what makes the audience relate to what's going on unless you actually show the danger and the horror? Is this film made to make you think? Then they need to deliver properly. People get a HINT of the danger of the bomb but merely do clever politics around it. I'm quite disappointed in such a slow burn of a movie. What's more interesting? SEEING the results of the characters or just hearing about them in fast cuts? You decide. I love long discussions too and mindplay.Actors are great.. Cinematography is great. Score is great and the story is fantastic. The execution is just lazy and low budget."
"The result is important, but that's about it and e all already know that. The story is boring and the movie is the most pretentious thing I have seen in a long time. I get it, the result is a big deal, probably the biggest deal known to human kind. But the movie isn't telling me anything I don't already know nor is it making it seem interesting but oh boy it sure is trying. It's sad cause Cillian has been one of my favorite actors. But the movie seems like a whole movie saying ""this is important and we are important people telling you how important this is"". We get it. Was looking forward to this WAY more than Barbie, but honestly Barbie wins. Im fighting hard to stay awake for the second half.....GOD THE SECOND HALF! I have to go back in now, let's see if I can do it."
"This is the film that cements Christopher Nolan as one of the best contemporary directors working as well as one of the best to ever make movies. From the moment the film starts, it hits the ground running and never lets up. It knows exactly what pace it wishes to set for three hours. There are even moments where you may not be 100% percent sure what is happening, but rest assured it all comes together. See it on the biggest screen you can find. I cannot wait to see this again because I'm sure there are parts that I didn't fully grasp. I might say this is one of the greatest films of all time easily one of the best of the past ten years or so. Go see it - now......"
"Nolan's best?Hard to say when everything this man does is groundbreaking. But this man is a genius, and if you didn't realize it before, you will after seeing Oppenheimer.Cillian wins the Oscar?There are times you forget that is not Oppenheimer and lose yourself in his heartbreaking performance. I see no reason to even nominate anyone else, The Academy may want to send the Oscar to Ireland now.RDJ in a non super hero?People forget that prior to the Iron Man film franchise he was a serious actor. Good Night and Good Luck was one of his best but his role in Oppenheimer has surpassed any role he's ever held. This may be his Oscar year as well, you end the film hating him so much.Emily Blunt?The forever drunk, emotionally immature Blunt gives her best performance yet. Being a selfish drunk whose side eye game dominates any scene she's in deserves our respect.Oppenheimer
I walked out of the film in tears and broken. No one wins. America builds a bomb, drops the bomb, wins WWII, only to enter another, longer war involving a terrifying arms race. Oppenheimer built a feat of science, then was thrown away by the US government that benefited from his invention as quickly as he tested the bomb. Once Oppenheimer realized the destruction he imparted, he realized that his selfishness and greed and need to be the best was all for naught. Oppenheimer doesn't win because he's labeled a communist sympathizer and loses his security clearance after championing a non-nuclear world. But the final scene, with Albert Einstein, who tells Oppy that they will love him until they don't anymore, and then they'll treat him like a relic of some long forgotten way of life-just as Oppenheimer had referred to Einstein earlier in the film-that is the moment it all comes together. I began to weep and couldn't stop. The despair and sadness in Cillian's face when it all falls on him at once, it will break your heart. There has not and will not be a movie like this for many, many years.Any negatives?I hold a Masters in Modern American History and a minor in Twentieth Century European History. Nolan did not put a single date in the film. As someone well versed in WWII, beyond the dates surrounding the war in Spain and WWII, I was actually unsure of the timeframe beyond decades. Even at the end when the single Senator voted against confirming Strauss, I knew it was JFK, but still could only say it was the mid to late 1950s. As a proud history nerd, I would have liked the dates. But beyond this, Oppenheimer may be as close to perfection as any film I've ever seen."
"I gave it 10/10 because the movie made me shook with the explosion of knowledge, of truth, of the realness.The soundtrack is very well done like really good the sound effects are out of this world. The hole theatre shook with the explosionAll the performances were very solid. Oscars worth.The duration is well deserved and Nolan makes do with the time. Nothing is there just for the sake of being there.I agree with the critics saying the last hour divided a lot of people. It's very politically focused although there are a few plot twists which were very good. I myself liked the last hourI don't agree with what they said about the arc of the feminine characters. They had their arc. Everyone had their arc.Overall a must see in IMAX ou Dolby Atmos."
"This is the first ever IMDB review that I write because I need to give this movie my stars. The camera work is amazing. The cast is amazing and the story is even better. The only downside was the fast pacing wich you may see as a positive thing and the use op a lot of different names for characters. The use of those names was somethimes a little confusing but it does not really affect the story as it is always clear after some thime who they are referring to. Me and my friend just sat there in the cinema after the movie was done. Both baffeled by what happend and the ending. I got goosebumps 3 times from some moments in the movie, never had that before in my life. I have read some negative reviews wich say it was boring.... The only thing they think is not boring is dangeling from a thin wire above a 30meter drop or something but this movie was not even close to boring."
"If there is anyone who knows how to direct tragic characters, it's Christopher Nolan. If you look at his resume, most of his movies focus on tragic characters, broken, victims of their own creation.J. Robert Oppenheimer is no stranger to that category, the man who created the atomic bomb in order to put an end to World War 2, has been haunted for the rest of his life with guilt and trauma over the results of his creation. Not only that, but after the war he was wrongfully accused of cooperating with the Soviet Union and was backstabbed by his friends and partners.I could go in depth over any aspect of the movie: the amazing assemble cast, the practical effects of Nolan in his movies and how his visual effects feel so real, the tragedy of the character, or the fear over a threat that still exists till this day (If you're aware of the Great Power Competition and the tension between nations, than the threat of nuclear war is lurking in the shadows).But I do want to focus on how the movie is trying to be so many things until it's not clear to determine what the movie is entirely about.Some may say it's a personal biography on how the atomic bomb affected the life of it's creator.Other people will say the movie focuses on the Manhattan project and the trinity test, the type of movie that focuses on a certain event or project in human history (movies like The Social Network, The Founder, etc.).There is also the option that the movie focuses on the aftermath of the Manhattan project and the ugly politics that happened behind the scenes, false accusations and political games (just like House of Cards and Succession).The problem I'm trying to point out is that Oppenheimer is a really complex film, this complexity is a bit overshadowed by how amazing and good the movie is, and I admire it too. The three hour run doesn't feel long to me at all.I guess the only problem the movie suffers from (but at the same time doesn't suffer) is it's lack of identity, a lack that I have a hard time to determine myself. Perhaps reviewing this movie will help understand it better.My favorite scene had to be the final one, when Oppenheimer is speaking to Albert Einstein and telling him that he fears of the chain reaction he has created. And then the camera shifts to Oppenheimer's face and he's imagining the destruction of the world, knowing it was caused by him, becoming death.In conclusion I just have to say on a personal note, that I wish more people would make movies like Nolan, Fincher and others. Movies that have a certain impact on the world of cinema. Forget about movies that are being used as a political tool for agendas or superhero movies like Marvel and DC that would not be remembered in a few years.Movies like Oppenheimer and many other good films that came out this year should be the ones to inspire young filmmakers to create something captivating and meaningful."
"Christopher Nolan returns to the big screen with a 100 million dollar budget and raises the bar for biographies, historical war dramas and cinema in its entirety. With an A-list celebrity cast, Oppenheimer delivers in every possible aspect. From cinematography to screenplay to sound editing, it is clear that this project was done with meticulous attention to detail and with an intense passion for the art of cinema.Portraying subjects of historical importance such as technological development, international affairs and military influence during uncertain times, this visually impacting project also presents a strong criticism towards a nation's system of order and egocentric political figures.It's rare to find a 3 hour movie that grasps viewers attention right form the start. With its fast paced tempo, time gets lost in interesting and intense conversations, accompanied by mind blowing sound effects that will create a long lasting impact on everyone willing to give Nolan their undivided attention.I am certain that this movie will be the best movie of 2023 and will probably be one of the best movies this decade. This movie undoubtedly deserves a 10 out of 10."
"Being a Chris Nolan film, my expectations were already through the roof for Oppenheimer. With a star-studded cast, it was set up for greatness. With this in mind, it actually exceeded my expectations. The acting, emotional impact, writing, music score, pacing, cinematography checked off all the boxes. I could talk about these concepts for hours, but I'll elaborate about what was most prominent.When looking at pacing, this 3 hour long bio pic starts off with a bang (no pun intended). I was immediately absorbed into the plot and, like a Amtrak train, the movie shot off. Usually, bio pics have some noticeable moments of down time, but Nolan's suspenseful style kept you intrigued the whole time. Oppenheimer may have the most uniform pacing out of all of his previous films.Oppenheimer is also dialogue heavy. There was so much packed into conversation that the viewer will be able to watch the film repeatedly and hear different perspectives with increased attention. The execution of this dialogue was profound. The final pieces of dialogue, including Emily Blunt and Jason Clarke stood out to me the most.Finally, the emotional impact caught my attention. I have heard from various sources that Nolan's older films ""neglect emotional connection."" This is definitely not the case for Oppenheimer. Fear and stress are demonstrated in a multitude of creative ways. From the foot stomping sound effects, to the bright flashes of white light. All of these features indicate a level of stress/anxiety that captured the moment perfectly and has a strong impact on the audience.This film easily deserves a five star. Oppenheimer blew away (no pun intended) my expectations to the point where I will definitely rewatch it in theaters. I'm a long time fan of Nolan films and am excited to see what he comes up with in the next 3 to 4 years."
"Christopher Nolan has outdone himself. This film will become known as his greatest work. He blends magnificent set design, compelling dialog, outstanding cinematography, and very fine acting into a lasting biopic masterpiece on the scale of something like Lawrence of Arabia. The Los Alamos sequences are unforgettable.There are a number of superior performances in this film. Led by Robert Downey Jr, who creates his best character since he was snubbed for Chaplin. Cillian Murphy, of course, in the lead role, appears to be a shoe-in for Best Actor, with Downey almost a certain winner for Best Supporting Actor. All other competitors will be hard-pressed to compete in these areas. Emily Blunt is effectively cold-blooded in her role as Oppenheimer's wife, but will face stiff competition from other productions that feature female, rather than male major characters. This film should win Best Film of the Year as well; best screenplay, and screenplay related categories, and almost every technical award I can think of. The film could use an intermission, and some of the sex scenes give it an R rating. I would recommend the film for those 13 years and older."
"Like many this weekend, I spend it in a pact theatre watching one of the most hyped-up movies this summer. Unfortunately for me, not only was the theatre packed but the air-conditioning was out of order too, so it got warm and humid in there quick. If it weren't for this, I could tell whether some of the people in the audience left the movie because they weren't interested (in particular - there were a pair of girls next to me whom kept checking their phones - I counted six instances before they left around the time Jean Tatlock died. I didn't check the time so I can't tell how far into the movie that was) or due to the heat in the theater.The movie itself didn't meet up my expectations but I still managed to enjoy it. Does that mean my expectations are too high or did the movie simply not appeal to me? Well, let's try to answer that by discussing for whom this movie is - in other words, what's the prototype of the viewer this movie is build for. I think it would be best to start by quickly describing what the movie is about but here we meet our first challenge - I'm not confident enough to say that this movie is primarily about Oppenheimer and his quest to build the atomic bomb. No, this movie is more of a court drama with a backstory presented in stretched flashback and an epilogue under a veil of overwhelming drama but the movie also has nods to multiple conspiracy theories that were popular at the present time. The movie also mentions various other impactful events, like the McCartney anti-communist program that requires some context to grasp the the impact it has on Oppenheimer and the connections the links to communism (Elizabeth Cox case, for example) and I feel like context around Lewis Strauss is also important in order to decode some of the messages to fully understand the gravity of the situation. So it seems that the movie is all over the place with some links that require a specific cultural capital to connect all the dots. Having that in mind, I can only determine that this movie is build for those who have a wide understanding of the US history, especially regarding the context of the Manhattan project and the discourse that followed it.One thing that did bother me quite a lot was the portrait of a scientist and the science community that this movie attempts to push. It's in no ways a negative connotation but it isn't a honest one either as it's the most evident signifier of commercialization - to say it mildly, every one that represented science in some way was presented as a witty fellow that spends most of his time talking, discussing theoretical phenomena and coming to the conclusions on the dot. At a certain point doing the movie, there was a critical remark suggesting that Oppenheimer stopped being a physicist a while ago and he's more of a politician now. To some extent, I'd have to agree because most of the scientist were portrayed more like politicians. Apart from the basic quantum mechanics principles and paradoxes that we're mentioned early in the movie, most of the scientific discourse didn't have a clear message to connotate it's magnitude.On the flipside, I loved the idea how the creation of the atomic bomb in way did start off the chain event that will lead to the destruction of the world. The whole discourse regarding the moral and the philosophical consequences of the atomic bomb after the successful test was just magnificent and in a way that's when the real movie has started for me. The scenes with exquisite sound design and hallucination-like visuals of how the people in the room from Oppenheimer's perspective might look under the atomic blast were breathtaking. The ideas of having blood on your hand just for taking part in creating a weapon of mass-destruction are mind-boggling. And the visuals, the visuals at certain scenes do deserve all the praise. Although the story took too many ""off-road"" turns, at least in my opinion, I still want to commend the story to be rather comprehensible, even though it wasn't linear at all and had multiple jumps in time. After just one watch I can't tell whether the switch from color to black & white scenes helped to grasp the time jumps or not, perhaps it's just the room or surrounding or the context itself that helped connect the timeline in order, but the presentation in such of the story in such a way did help me to understand the story just a little bit better, leaving only the questions in context behind.Overall, I can't say this is a bad movie in any way possible but I can't say that I particularly liked it either. The hype for the movie was real - whether it was reddit post showcasing the massive film reel of this movie or early film reviewers portraying this movie as an important landmark in cinema - but I feel the hype also ruined the movie for me a bit as I definitely didn't meet the expectations it set off for me. At the end of the day, I'm just happy most movie snobs and just casual movie viewers can enjoy and appreciate this as a cinema marvel. Even though I don't fall into that category, I must admit that the general discourse surrounding this movie does make me happy and the fact that it made a lot of people look into such an influential figure in modern history is great too."
"A biography that could have been trimmed down by half an hour on each side. If you don't like slow biographies where half the movie is cross-examining people in a tiny room, Nolan is not going to make you like it now.The entire subplot around Strauss could have been chopped way down as I stopped caring about 30 minutes before its resolution. Seriously, the movie goes for at least 45 minutes of boring courtroom drama after the climax.Cool visual effects are few and far between, and the movie tries to present shallow and obvious ideas as deep and meaningful, such as ""the next generation of scientists will not be obsessed with your contributions and will be eager to make their own contributions"". The movie goes out of its way to show how Oppenheimer's and Einstein's work was just a small part of a larger system, and how humanity would have built the bomb one way or another, and then ends on the therefore irrelevant notion that ""Einstein and Oppenheimer started a chain reaction which will end the world"". Why should this feel shocking when the whole movie is talking about the inevitability that all of that would happen?There is a great little 1.5 hour biography to show to high school history students buried in there somewhere, but virtually everything Nolan did to try to make the movie more than that was a swing and a miss. If you swapped the name of the director and didn't use 20 A-list actors, I don't think many people would have much interest in this movie."
"A brilliant film from master director Christopher Nolan, whose catalogue of unforgettable movies continues to grow.Perhaps the most concentration required of myself at the cinemas since Daniel Day Lewis in Lincoln. But what a brilliant film, telling the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer and, as must be the case, the development of the atomic weapon that was eventually unleashed twice on the Empire of Japan to end the Second World War. (And, it could be said, begin a whole new kind of war).Cillian Murphy is brilliant as the titular character. Really, the entire cast was fantastic, but especially Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer and Matt Damon, especially well-cast as General Leslie Groves. A tip of the hat, also, to Robert Downey Jr. And Freddie Mercury himself, Rami Malek.A three hour movie that was gripping and intense, chock-full of information, the film switching back and forth between various stages of Oppenheimer's life. Some stunning visuals, a great script and Murphy's nuanced performance. What a fantastic movie!"
"Normally I am not a big fan of long biopics as most of them are completely dull and boring. Not so with Christopher Nolan's latest masterpiece Oppenheimer with an all star cast that includes Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, as well as Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and the great Robert Downey Jr.Oppenheimer is a three hour movie but it feels like its only two and the film is divided into three acts.: the background of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the atomic bomb trinity test and the final hour is devoted to the courtroom hearings of the Atomic nuclear commission headed by Lewis Straus played by Robert Downey Jr in another Oscar worthy performance. This film details the birth of the atomic bomb, how it ended World War 2 and the devastation of nuclear weapons in the world today.Everyhting about this film is masterpiece, the sets, the costumes, the direction and of course all of the performances. The explosion of the trinity test is worth the price of admission alone and it almost blew my eardrums off. The ending will haunt you and will leave you with a greater knowledge of one of history's most important landmarks.Oppenheimer will definitely be in the Oscar racce and will undoubtedly be on many critics top ten lists of 2023!Most of all it's a million times better than the awful Barbie movie.Oppenheimer is the thinking person's movie in a summer filled with endless remakes and soulless sequels It's definitely the best film of 2023 so far! Buy your tickets now!"
"Nolan is my favorite director, second to none. I just love all his movies and I don't think there is a bad movie in his CV.He is a real man because he makes the movies exactly the way he wants them, using the best possible technology at that moment for a real experience on the big screen, the way movies should be seen.On the one hand, this is a slightly different film in his career. A three-hour biographical drama with no effects, no CGI, no big twist at the end of the movie is something we haven't seen from Nolan since... well, never. On the other hand, he stayed true to himself by using his signature and style, so we can see part of the film in black and white, that is, part of the action, the non-linear flow of the story, a great interest in physics, we have seen all of this to a certain extent in his films, such as Interstellar or Memento. I was delighted with the final product because, theoretically, I would not have been drawn to the cinema by a biopic about an American scientist who invented the atomic bomb, and on top of that, it lasts for three full hours. At no point was the film boring to me, I did not feel its true duration. That's a big compliment.Right at the beginning, I noticed that the film will have a lot of text because, as expected, there is a lot of dialogue, but these dialogues take place at a slightly higher speed, there are not many breaks. This was fine with me because it drew my attention to follow more closely. To be honest, I didn't check this later, I'm just giving my personal impression. Also in the film there are a lot of events and characters over a long period of time, there are no unnecessary scenes, things change and I think that this contributed to the film holding attention throughout its duration.The cast of the film is quite strong and diverse, and Cillian Murphy, who portrays the title character, had a career role, and I predict an Oscar nomination for him, at the very least. He carried the entire film on his back, and he is portrayed as a layered and complicated man, he is neither positive nor negative, he is neither good nor bad, but he has his virtues and flaws, his doubts and moral doubts, it is up to us as viewers to judge what he is like. Clearly, all of this would not be possible without the accompanying ensemble, which is also at the highest level. Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon and Emily Blunt deserve all the praise who are in the best scenes of the film, showing their pure talent when there is no green screen next to them. I must also say that the film has very, very many characters, some of whom are proven actors and Oscar winners who appear literally in a cameo role, one or two scenes for a minute or so and that's it. Obviously when Nolan does something then everyone clears their schedule to be a part of such a project. I won't mention who they are because I didn't know that myself, so I was positively surprised when I saw them in the movie.The film has several themes that it deals with and I think it balances them brilliantly. So we have biography, court drama, politics, history, physics, and moral doubts about whether something should be done just because it can be done. So much that I probably didn't manage to catch everything in one viewing, so I'm drawn to watch it again. In addition to all that, the film has a very important message.Nowadays, this film is exactly what we need when we are bombarded with various blockbusters and franchises with countless sequels and heavy effects. That I can watch something a little different in peace, and yet that it is visually beautiful, with a great sound and soundtrack. I understand that there will be a good portion of people who will not like this movie, but that is a topic for another discussion. The fact that a three-hour drama will manage to make money in theaters in this day and age speaks volumes. I predict several Oscars in various categories. A movie with a capital letter, the movie we needed, not the one we deserved.Thank you, Nolan!"
"It's a great movie ... it's not just about him making US nuclear power & world war 2 .., it's more about the human aspect , the way he was thinking after nagasaki and hiroshima attacks.It's a combination of brilliant actor Cilian Murphy & Genius director Christopher Nolan🔥🔥
For me it's a Movie Of The Year.It's a great movie ... it's not just about him making US nuclear power & world war 2 .., it's more about the human aspect , the way he was thinking after nagasaki and hiroshima attacks.It's a combination of brilliant actor Cilian Murphy & Genius director Christopher Nolan🔥🔥
For me it's a Movie Of The Year."
"Christopher Nolan Delivered.The comparisons to The Social Network are fitting and well-suited. The perspective of Oppenheimer being the focal point of this film was necessary and I don't think you could tell this story any other way, while at the same time hammering home the emotional impact in it that this creation left on the world.Cillian Murphy's titular performance and the amazing cast deserves all the recognition and praise. The third act is an absolute gut punch and felt through waves of the final testimony scenes.The three-hour runtime flies by and the message in the final moments of this film is felt and heard loudly. Nolan delivers a film of the decade with a resonating message that will sit with its viewers for days and hopefully years to come."
"Heart pounding, adrenaline rush, breathtaking, mind-blowing...this is how it felt watching this movie for 180 minutes.Simply and gigantically this is movie making at its finest.Talking about scriptwriting which was orchestrated to deliver some of the smartest fast paced dialogues in cinéma history supported with genius sound mixing and score that was ment to rock your very core.Brilliant cinematography that puts you in the mind of Oppenheimer visualizing his very thoughts.Stellar performances all over, but Oh my My goodness, Robert D. Jr! Respect for a master class on acting!Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a master class in film making by all means. Even an IMAX screen is not big enough to watch this achievement."
"Oppenheimer is a uniquely told biopic about the man and team that created the nuclear bomb.Starting with the positives: Cilian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Need to get an Oscar nomination for these performances. The sound, score and cinematography are impeccable. The detonation scene will go down in history for one of the greatest scenes ever, and Nolan deserves the nomination for that alone. I have never felt more thrilled and captivated than in this scene. The silence in the filled theatre gave me chills. The theatre experience is a must to fully enjoy this film. I don't think it would give the same effect watching it at home.The film was very timely considering our current political climat on AI and the impact of technology on humanity. I enjoyed the criticism of the American Nationalism, and the way they portrayed Oppenheimer's gilt. That scene in the auditorium with the people loudly stomping their feet was a masterpiece. I just wish the film was more like that than the rest of this mess.The film starts off strong with the characterization of Oppenheimer by showcasing his obsession with physics. They introduce these complex topics easily enough for the audience, but I'll need a 2nd watch to understand all the political parts. However, the first act's editing is a bit clunky. The scenes are cut too short, and it makes it difficult to follow the story, and care for the characters. New faces would constantly appear, and it would get confusing to understand their purpose to the narrative. This gets me to Florence Pugh which was critically underused. Her character was underdeveloped, and I would personally have cut her out of the film to leave more space for Emily Blunt's character. We get that one scene towards the end with her that was good, but it was hard to care since we barely got to know her. The film barely passes the Bechdall test, and leaves a lot to be desired from the female characters that all fell flat. It bewilders me to see how we got to know so little of the characters in a 3+ hour film.Focusing on communism and the courtroom drama was important for the story, but there was too much of it. I don't see how Robert Downey Jr's character was so present. I don't think he should have been a focus, even if I think it was an excellent performance. It left me wanting more on the critique of this invention, and the impact it had on the characters. I think archival footage of Hiroshima would have pertinent, in addition to scenes that speculated more on the character's feelings towards the ethics of this bomb.The final scene is what makes this film so haunting. The decision to add Einstein and to bring back this critical dialogue scene is probably why so many love this film. It leaves you with this twisted feeling, and somewhat of an open ending that is meant to spark discussion. Overall, there are some excellent moments in this film, but it sadly doesn't take the spot of my favourite Nolan film."
"This is one of, if not, the best that has come from Nolan. There wasn't a single moment where I had felt truly bored considering this was a 3 hour film with lots and lots of dialogue. The pacing was top notch, for what was 3 hours felt like 2.5 hours. Somehow 30 mins just vanished. Every scene felt like it mattered, I didn't feel any sense of a scene being filler.Now there are a few, barely significant things that did take me out of the experience but these are just nitpicks. One being Cillian Murphy looking far too old to be Oppenheimer during his university years (which I can understand considering there wasn't any de-aging that could be done as the movie had no CGI), the score being present throughout almost the movie. There are only two scenes I can recall without the violins and cellos, the third being the dialogue mixing could have been slightly better as there were some instances where I couldn't catch a piece of dialogue. Now here are the great aspects of the film.The cast is just, phenomenal. It is very easy to overshadow Oppenheimer considering the amount of talent that was present but thankfully it did not happen. Every single person was bringing in their A-Game. Cillian Murphy was fantastic, RDJ did amazing as Lewis Straus, what really surprised me was the intimidating and intense performance given by Jason Clarke as Roger Robb. If it had not been for how amazing Cillian was, I could definitely see an Oscar nomination go towards both RDJ and Jason for best supporting actors. It is a crime that Florence Pugh and Rami Malek did have hardly 5 mins of screen time but they played their parts great, especially Rami during the court scene with Straus. For almost every single character that existed in this movie, it is very difficult to see anyone else being played by another person.The sound design was top notch. Watching it in IMAX, the bass in the scene post Trinity test was overwhelming and I love how it portrayed the stress and anxiety that it gave Oppenheimer. Every other scene that did convey these uncomfortable emotions was executed flawlessly.The score was just, phenomenal. Ludwig Göransson is one hell of a composer and I could see him as an industry leader soon in the future. Even if I feel as if the score was present for a little too long, I cannot deny how amazing it was. It accented every scene in how it conveyed the dread, stress, anxiety and the weight of a situation.Now thing I must commend the film's efforts on is the buildup towards the dropping of the bomb during its test. The tension was palpable, the countdown was anxiety inducing. And then, it goes off. The moment of silence before the shockwave hit is the moment that will stick with me for ages. The bright yellow/orange glow upon the faces of the scientists, the realization Oppenheimer experiences and the aftermath of what this bomb may cause. That first viewing of this moment is an experience I will never get.Overall, this movie is a must watch and if possible, you have to see it in IMAX."
"Nolan did a great job hiding some extended details of this film on the trailers because I did not expect to see some of what I saw during the film itself. The film itself came off as kind of boring. The odd nude scenes and sex scenes also came off as crude and unnecessary. Some scenes like what was mentioned repeat or become redundant throughout the film. The film focused too much on Oppenheimer's politics and not enough on the man himself. I'm not a fan of any film that makes politics one of the primary themes. I knew that Oppenheimer had political leanings, but did not expect Nolan to go this deep into that part of his life.Footage of the climatic atomic bomb explosion seemed to have been kept to a bare minimum. His wife became a depressed and angry mess of a character as the film progressed. Oppenheimer himself exhibited some troubling behavior, as when he was speaking to a crowd, he was imagining a bomb going off as movie goers were greeted with grotesque imagery of people's faces literally being melted off. In summary, this is not a film that I would recommend seeing again."
"""Oppenheimer"" 2023. Biopic of ""Father of the atomic bomb"" J. Robert Oppenheimer. Written and directed by Christopher Nolan. Starring Cillian Murphy and an all-star cast and multiple cameo appearances: Kenneth Branagh, Matt Damon, Gary Oldman, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and her girls, Robert Downey Jr, Rami Malek, Casey Affleck, Josh Harnett, Tom Conti, Jason Clarke, Tony Goldwyn, Matthew Modine, Benny Safdie, and Rin Tin Tin.""Oppenheimer"" is a pretentious film that tries too hard and leads with technique. For this viewer, the film's thudding emphasis on film-making technique, and its rejection of conventional storytelling, was alienating. I noticed how incredibly loud the movie is. It was like being at a rock concert. Some scenes are shot in black and white. Some scenes are shot in color. Each scene is very brief. Who characters are is entirely unclear. Narrative is broken up into bits, juggled, and disjointed. Scenes take place out of time sequence. The film covers Oppenheimer's life from when he was a grad student to his old age. I had no idea why Nolan played the film out of time sequence.The all-star cast and multiple cameo performances drew a great deal of attention to themselves. That attention, in addition to the film's other technical emphases, completely made it impossible for me to experience any willing suspension of disbelief. I never for one second forgot that I was watching a movie written and directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Cillian Murphy. I never for one second saw J. Robert Oppenheimer on screen. I saw actor and star Cillian Murphy, who has come a long way from ""Red Eye,"" back in 2005. I kept thinking about Murphy's performance choices as an actor. He doesn't so much hand in three hours worth of acting; he hands in the same performance for three hours. Murphy always speaks in the same flat, monotonous voice. He displays virtually no facial expressions.When Gary Oldman showed up in a cameo as Harry Truman all I could think was, ""Which star is going to show up next? Kim Kardashian as Eleanor Roosevelt?"" I recognized Kenneth Branagh but I had little idea of which historical figure he was playing and what significance that historical figure had to the plot. When Tony Goldwyn, in what may have been an extravagant wig, appeared onscreen, I just kept starring at his face thinking, ""I know this actor but I can't place who he is.""Florence Pugh plays the part of a snotty and doomed woman who has an affair with Oppenheimer. Pugh is topless in a couple of scenes and bottomless in one more scene. Again, all I could think about while watching these scenes was ""Boy, she really wants you to see her girls."" I didn't care about any of the so-called ""drama"" onscreen. I never cared about the character she played, about the real life woman on whom this character was based, or Oppenheimer's affair with this woman. It was all flat, lifeless, something attempting to be drama, but never quite getting there. Oh, and then there was more NOISE.Read the New York Times review of Oppenheimer. Manohla Dargis praises the film. All she talks about is technique. She talks about writer-director Christopher Nolan. She talks about Nolan's decisions as to how much atomic bomb horror to show onscreen. She talks about how LOUD the movie is. She talks about ""complex structure"" and ""the plasticity of the film medium."" ""Superb cinematography."" ""65 millimeter film"" ""black and white film"" Look, if you are fascinated by filmmaking technique, ""Oppenheimer"" is the film for you.I would have walked out, but I was with another person, so I had to sit through three hours of utter boredom and, yes, contempt for this pretentious film. Nolan is struggling so hard to create a work of art that approaches the seriousness of the atomic bomb. For me, he failed. I cared less about nuclear annihilation after watching the movie than before I entered the theater.A quieter, more intimate, more coherent, more old fashioned film could have moved me. Any number of incidents from Oppenheimer's life could have filled a two-hour film and ultimately said more about atomic weapons than this three hour exercise in noisy incoherence. Oppenheimer tried to murder his professor. That could have been a two-hour movie. Oppenheimer confronting the awesome task of developing a weapon capable of destroying the world. What Oppenheimer and others confronted in Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. Oppenheimer's marriage. Oppenheimer was a womanizer. He was a father who gave his children away when they annoyed him. He and his women liked to drink and smoke and they all seemed pretty lost. Focus on any one of these features could have made a moving film. Instead we get bombast, pretension, and a movie that never lets you forget who made it."
"The movie is incredible. I love how they started from the beginning not just starting at making the a-bom. It was very interesting to watch his life and everything that happened. The visuals and the actors are phenomenal. I already had so much respect for Cillian Murphy, but hell this man can act. He was amazing and I loved RDJ as Strauss and Emily Blunt as Kitty. They were all so good! If you are like me and like your history stuff then you already know how it ends. But even though I knew, my eyes were locked on the screen, I was nervous, I was angry, I was sad, I felt relieved. It was a rollercoaster of emotions and I am glad that I had them. I know this movie isn't for anyone because 3 hours is a long sit, but for me it didn't even feel like 3 hours. I absolutely loved it, best actors, best cinematography, best music, best writing. I can go on forever. Go see this, it's a very interesting and big part of history and an incredible made movie."
"Christopher Nolan's latest film is a refined, technically superb, and gripping epic, detailing perhaps the most important development in modern human history and the man behind it all.Thankfully 'Oppenheimer' isn't a cradle to grave biopic as these rarely work. Instead it charts the most crucial years of Oppenheimer's life as he is recruited into and leads the Manhattan Project. It balances a re-telling of the events with an exploration of the man really well which makes for a thoroughly engaging and complete experience.There is a risk that with a three hour film some of this impact can be lost and bogged down in unnecessary details, but fear not. Nolan's creative use of non-linear storytelling combined with expert sound design and editing conjures up a sense of urgency that ensures the film flies by and never loses its impact.As you'd expect with a Nolan film the cast is stacked, with too many great performances to mention. However a particular shout out needs to go to Cillian Murphy in the lead role. He brings the intriguing layers and complexities of Oppenheimer to the screen brilliantly with a captivating and engaging performance. Emily Blunt shines in the role of his wife Kitty, often stealing the show with her forceful command of the character, and Robert Downey Jr also deserves a mention with a well executed performance.Nolan is a master of his craft so the direction of the film is practically flawless. It looks and feels crisp and refined and the camera work is wonderful. The absence of Hanz Zimmer isn't felt, as Ludwig Goransson delivers a sublime score that compliments the film's themes perfectly.Christopher Nolan has conquered superheroes, mysteries and thrillers, sci-fi, and now the biopic. Oppenheimer demonstrates once again why he is one of the best directors of our time."
"To everybody saying it's too boring, it's too long and there's too much talking, this movie is based off a biography of Oppenheimer's life during the Manhattan Project, the Trinity Test, and everything that ensured after. This wasn't a movie about the bomb but what it represents. Just like the splitting of the atom starting a chain reaction that detonates, the birth of the atom bomb started a chain reaction of destruction and fear that is still felt to this day. The movie does an amazing job at getting the viewer to feel the emotions that Oppenheimer felt after seeing the aftermath of his creation. Devastation. The way they used imagery and camera work to accurately depict his fragile mental psyche following the bombs dropped in Japan to the blatant collusion of the U. S. Government against him and trying to discredit and blacklist him as a traitor after he spoke against the bomb. Christopher Nolan has solidified himself as a generational talent in directing, storytelling and imagery with this polarizing and operatic film."
"Oppenheimer, could be, one of the best biographical movie ever existed. It does have a lot of ""heavy"" conversations but man, it leaves a strong impression and it is so compelling that made me speechless.Star-studded cast was not just for nothing, they truly, truly delivers each character perfectly. Especially Cillian, damn, brilliant performance. I truly wish that I could watch it in IMAX 70mm, the way they originally filmed it with.It is three hours long but I highly recommend you guys to watch Oppenheimer in the best theatre you could find in your city. Yes its gonna be boring if you're just accompanying your friend or S/O without actually intended to invest your time in this."
"Firstly, I am not a Nolan fan. That means I will not overrate and exagerate his averagely good films. Oppenheimer is a great historical drama not because of its directing but because of its interstellar casting from Downey Jr. To Malek, from Pough to Blunt or From Damon to Affleck. Not to mention Murphy who underacts just perfectly. Just wow... Even extras are famous in this movie...Editing and soundtrack are the two other significant reasons of Oppenheimer's success. Nolan is and was always surrounded with great crew members and post staff. His directing or lack of directing can never keep up with his unique imagination and writing skills.Go watch this movie because it is an epic Historical Drama not because Nolan fanboys said so... capiche?"
"Oppenheimer is an enthralling character drama concerning the life of Robert Oppenheimer and all of the politics, challenges, and nuances that surrounded his work on the atomic bomb. Aside from an at times thrilling score to make otherwise relatively non-thrilling conversation between characters elevated, the film does not have any big dopamine moments aside from the detonation. All of this said, I was absolutely captivated the entire time. It is important to make this distinction because those with less... refined, attention spans may find it a near impossible task to tolerate 3 hours of this dialogue heavy film. I wish I could have experienced this in 70mm IMAX but digital will have to do."
"I consider something masterpiece when it does not let you doubt for a second. The watching experience itself should be so absorbing that you don't even see any shortcomings. Yes later you might think of few. That is what this film is. It totally catches your attention, there is no flashy Hollywood sci-fi, action nothing. It is simple story narrated with excellence. Don't believe all those mocking reviews which say you need to know physics for this, absolutely not. Basic knowledge of science is enough and you get the context of stuff going on but yes you need to pay attention. Don't put your mind on those free refill popcorns and drinks. Narration is really tight. Performances are excellent. Background music as always for Nolan - awesome. I am giving 9 only because I was expecting more from the character of Emily Blunt, she is a wonderful actress, my concern is with the character, it could have been explored little more."
"Oppenheimer (2023) is a lot. I feel like that's the best way to describe this movie. Obviously, all the performances were absolutely incredible, especially from Cillian Murphy, R. D. J, and Emily Blunt. Oppenheimer takes even mundane scenes to the most tense possibility. You'll probably feel the same in the seconds leading up to the Trinity test as you feel watching Cillian Murphy sit in a chair in the background while everyone else talks, it's that tense. It's also incredibly melancholic, the movie ends where you expect it to but the revelations and connections back to the beginning are perfectly executed. Oppenheimer was an incredibly complex individual and while the movie does want you to root for him it also showcases many of his shortcomings throughout his life. The Trinity test itself is beautiful in an eerie way and what follows is even more interesting. The dialogue is spot on and the sound mixing is insanely well done which is a big step up from Nolan's other movies. Definitely a must-see in IMAX. Almost perfect except for the sex scenes, especially the one during the interview, which were so out of place and made my whole theater uncomfortable. (9/10)"
"Oppenheimer was just okay-good. It felt much too rushed at times, much too slow at others, but always forced.Though the acting was stellar, the movie itself was a long, jerky, scattered bio-pic that tried to do a little too much at the expense of being a great.I left feeling too many important themes were just glossed and insufficiently explored for a movie of this magnitude.Sometimes a movie tries to mention everything and ends up saying nothing.But it's always cool to see physicists, scientists, and math legends (and their famous egos) get screen time. The star studded cast and their incredible performances was the saving grace, but even they could only do so much to save the awkward pacing and complex themes left on the table, barely touched."
"Christopher Nolan's incessant use of suspenseful music is a crutch heavily leaned on in Oppenheimer. It seems as though the filmaker believes that bombarding the audience with intense musical cues will create an illusion of tension and excitement. However it becomes evident that the music is attempting to compensate for what is simply a very boring story line!Its an uninspired plot, which struggles to maintain even the faintest glimmer of interest. The runtime feels painfully stretched, leading to an inexplicable endurance test for viewers. I found myself counting the minutes until the credits mercifully rolled!!!"
"I tend to gravitate towards fiction more than fact. Never been a big fan of war, true events or biographies and I wasn't sure about this one, especially with its three hour run time. Besides Dunkirk (skipped it for obvious reasons) I have yet to be disappointed by any of his works and took a chance. Yes, I even liked Tenet...Robert J. Oppenheimer is often considered a controversial figure in the history of the US WWII. Dubbed as the father of the of the atomic bomb that claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the title would begin to weight heavy around his neck as he would try to unsuccessfully appeal to the president against further use. Hailed as a hero and then eventually tried as a potential spy for the Soviets, his loyalty would come under question as the eventual regret of his achievement and his past dealings with the communist party is weaponized against him by someone fairly close to him but who?I went in expecting a non eventful history lesson but got a movie with a slight mystery, instead. I am happy to say in today's climate, where it has gotten increasingly hard to bank on well known actors and directors to deliver a good film, Nolan still remains a reliable source for quality. His penchant for presenting scenes out of order, a slow but intense build of music in the background and short and quick lines of dialogue managed to keep the pacing quite brisk despite the long runtime and the lack of any actual action of any kind, it is simply brilliant. Perhaps not seeing any of the trailers and looking at a handful of reviews might have tempered my expectations? Or maybe I just got lucky that I found it entertaining unlike some of the movie goers around me. Eitherway, I will point out while this movie is great, its not perfect. You do need to go in with a tempered expectations as it has no action sequence, a lot of talk of theory and calculations along with a court drama towards the end. If you are expecting any scenes of war or action, you will be disappointed. However, if you have slight interest in science and are only vaguely familiar with name and facts around Oppenheimer, there is a story with a slight twist this movie tells and its well worth the watch atleast once.Speaking of expectations, a lot of reviews seem to point out a certain singular moment as a caution and its possible that the version I saw had been edited but I have to ask 'WHERE WAS THE LONG GRATITOUS SEX SCENE??"" Was it the intense breathing as the camera slowly pans by a wall? The only signs of nudity was a brief seconds of Oppenheimer sitting in a chair with his legs crossed, having a conversation. If this is a cause for concern then we have definitely gone backwards from the days of the FCC censorship. Because the scene is less than thirty seconds and subtle in a way where you don't really take notice."
"I had a high expectation for this one since not only Chris Nolan is directing but also my favourite actor Cillian is playing the lead role. When I watched this film those expectations were not only met but also exceeded. You really get into the head of Oppenheimer in the film. This one really is more about Oppenheimer than it is about the atomic bomb. This movie even though 3 hours long, will not keep you away. It has kept me engaged throughout. Editing, dialogues, cinematography and especially acting are on top. There is no questioning about Nolan's direction. That detonation scene though, it is hard to put it in words. I mean you have to experience it in big screens. I am glad watched this in IMAX. Absolutely brilliant. For me this is the BEST FILM EVER MADE."
"A full throated, adult - I mean to say perfectly serious - epic story about American exceptionalism and how that is more likely than not a total crock; what the film is truly about, at least in my immediate estimation before I sleep on it, is how easily it is to make many, many enemies in a country that is at SuperPower status in a world where Nazism can fold and then Communism (or just you know anyone the Government disagrees with) can be next. It's a terrifically absorbing and gloriously verbose film about the creation of the Atomic bomb, like the pure joy of watching science nerds writing feverishly on chalkboards (and the jar of marbles), but that's just part of it.What I think made Nolan really want to make this a reality, aside from Oppenheimer being an endlessly fascinating collection of mixed emotions and thoughts and genius and ""blood on my hands"" level of guilt, is how power is so completely at the mercy of who gets to be in control - and what it means for a fubdamentaly decent person to reckon with the power to destroy (the apple scene early on is an apt metaphor). The Branaugh line about giving the world the power to destroy itself, and not being prepared. It's even more than that: some may think they are prepared, while others just try to wash their hands with it. And all the while, you are plunged and plugged into a first-person perspective like few others this high-wired and singular (Taxi Driver is in this league). Haunting, really.Lots and lots of thoughts on this I still need to digest, but easily Nolan's greatest achievement at least as a writer - the dialog is constantly involving and urgent and dramatically alive (and just fun to listen to) in ways I'm not sure I've experienced from him, and the structure is going to keep me going back to it another half dozen times in the next year or two - and Downey Jr, among a titanic heavyweight cast ranging from Gary Oldman to Macon Blair, almost steals the movie from everyone as a world class shitbag (or, your typical DC power-player who got scorned once). And the ending is devastating.Some more thoughts on a second viewing: I know JFK gets brought up in reviews and with critics (and even Nolan himself), but I thought of Born on the Fourth of July for the set piece when Oppenheimer gives the speech; when Ron Kovic talks to the 4th of July crowd and all the sound drops out except for a baby crying and helicopters, it's a subjective perspective of PTSD to an extreme.I think Oppenheimer has that as well, and it's a traumatic sequence that really got to me on a second viewing, not only the blinding white light and the woman with tatters on her face, but the subjects as he's stumbling out who are a) making out, b) crying, c) vomiting, and other things. It's astonishing the degree there and at a few other key points where Nolan means to break apart his mind through his editing and camerawork.And after all Oppenheimer is a theoretical physicist who thought he could maintain himself with what he was doing, and he absolutely could not.... but then I think Nolan's point here, as Stone maybe had with initially deluded boy scout Kovic and Vietnam, is that... who can ever face that? It's bigger than everyone on a psychic level. It's about how Science and Politics can't be compatible. That's chilling to me.Nitpick on this rewatch: Florence Pugh is not given a lot to work with past ""I'm kind of batty and tragic,"" and while Emily Blunt gets more to do and is terrific, and I dont mean to say Pugh phones it in on what she's asked to do, it seems kind of reductive that she is more of a story device. This doesn't mean she doesn't have a pivotal moment - I don't mean necessarily *that* line - the dialog right before it, where Oppy tells her about nearly poisoning his professor. Is he Jungian? Is he that kind of helmet from Full Metal Jacket, Born to Kill and Peace symbol? Not quite, it's more complicated than that... or maybe so simple. Which makes that Pugh's Isadora and her small role more difficult to accept.Or, to put it into comparison with the Aviator, which is strangely another film I thought of this time (not just because Nolan at one time wanted to make a Hughes biopic, rather both films deal with subjects who have mania and horrible weights on their shoulders, this one though far more grave), if Blunt is Katherine Hepburn than Pugh is Ava Gardner. Oh, well."
"Title: A Critical Review: Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer""In ""Oppenheimer,"" Christopher Nolan plunges into the labyrinth of the Manhattan Project, depicting the life and internal conflict of Robert Oppenheimer, the man at the epicenter of it all. Nolan, known for his sophisticated narratives, delivers yet another stirring and profound masterpiece.Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer is at the heart of the film. Murphy captures the multifaceted persona of Oppenheimer with profound authenticity, manifesting the physicist's intellectual brilliance and the moral torment that ensued from his involvement in the creation of the atomic bomb. His depiction of Oppenheimer is a masterstroke in acting, brilliantly portraying a man on the razor's edge of scientific discovery and human destruction.Emily Blunt as Katherine, Oppenheimer's wife, offers a moving performance. Her depiction of a woman wrestling with the moral implications of her husband's work is deeply touching. Blunt's nuanced portrayal provides an affecting counterpoint to Murphy's tormented Oppenheimer, forming an emotionally resonant narrative core.Robert Downey Jr., in his most profound role since ""Chaplin,"" plays Lewis Strauss, the stern figurehead of the Atomic Energy Commission. Abandoning his typically charismatic persona, Downey Jr. Brings an intensity and seriousness that is riveting. His performance offers a stark look at the determination of the U. S. administration during the atomic age. His role as Strauss adds a layer of authority and command to the narrative, effectively embodying the bureaucratic pressure that fueled the Manhattan Project.Nolan's directorial prowess shines throughout, masterfully weaving together the personal turmoil of Oppenheimer with the wider socio-political climate of the era. The pacing is expertly managed, building tension incrementally before culminating in a classic Nolan climax.""Oppenheimer"" excels in historical representation. The production design, costumes, and cinematography blend together to create an immersive 1940s world. Shot for IMAX, the movie provides a truly authentic and captivating experience.However, the film's complex narrative structure could be a point of critique. At times, the story can feel a little convoluted, and certain plotlines may get obscured. Despite this minor shortcoming, the film's central themes and emotional impact remain strong and potent.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" stands as a deeply moving examination of one of history's most controversial figures. The compelling performances by Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and an unexpectedly serious Robert Downey Jr. Offer a rich and diverse portrayal of characters. Though the narrative complexity might pose challenges for some viewers, Nolan's deft directorial hand ensures a captivating and reflective cinematic experience. ""Oppenheimer"" serves as a stark reminder of the weighty moral responsibilities accompanying scientific advancement, leaving a lasting impression long after the credits roll."
"In a revelation that history books have overlooked, ""Oppenheimer"" brilliantly portrays the vital role of J. Robert Oppenheimer in ending World War II. The film delves into his profound stance on mass destruction weapons and their global impact. Once again, Christopher Nolan impresses the audience with exceptional sound mixing, cinematography, and a compelling script. Though the film begins slowly with numerous character introductions and politics, it culminates in a harmonious and thought-provoking finale. Not being a history buff myself, the movie ignited a genuine curiosity about Oppenheimer, demonstrating the power of cinema to spark interest and conversation. A special shoutout to Cillian Murphy, whose phenomenal acting brings the character to life."
"My first watch of this film was on opening day, second half of a double feature, and without the knowledge of critical response. This viewing was a few days later among friends in an IMAX theater. That viewing I was impressed with Christopher Nolan's technical ability and the performances are fantastic. I forgot how much folks overrate those aspects of movies until later in the day and the following days when I see this film being praised as one of the best ever.It most certainly is not that great.The politics are dumb and the storytelling choice is incredibly questionable. But to discuss the storytelling I feel it is important to break down the story.This is a biopic about Julius Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. How this guy went from a talented Jewish physics student to potentially the most influential scientist that has ever existed. From the start Nolan presents Oppenheimer as a gifted young man with a knack for understanding physics. We get the impression that this is the golden boy and a pure genius, everything wrong with stories about smart people. But after the start, we don't get much of that at all. Oppenheimer is then shifted away from gifted person to a leader who understands how to manage folks and does not pretend to be perfect and great at everything. Most of the science in this film is relatively silly dialogue that technically makes sense but I have no idea why they occur when and how they do, almost like Nolan doesn't really know how these places function. The film does get so far away from its initial presentation of Oppenheimer that it is regularly stated that this man does not participate in physics much anymore. Quite the contradiction that I think is done well enough and probably reflects the real story.Where Nolan gets into trouble is the explicit discussion on politics, of which this film is deeply dependent on. Something that I expected given the historical J Robert Oppenheimer mixed with how questionable Christopher Nolan's politics seem to be.I've touched on my interpretation of Nolan's politics in the films of his that I've watched so there really is no point in including those here as this film is more about how he understands politics that are different from his own. Capital-C Communism was almost the entirety of American politics from the end of WW1 until the fall of the Soviet Union. And really the height of its influence was probably in the years between WW2 and Vietnam, though its roots are much older, dating back to lower-case-c communism and the theorists of the 19th century. Oppenheimer very well was a communist in the academic sense of the word. He read all three volumes of Das Kapital, something that very much makes him more well read than almost all Communists, past or present. He even understood the concepts well enough to take his students to the massive labor strikes and union meetings that were a major part of global politics in the 1930s. This fact seems to be completely lost on Christopher Nolan as he presents communism, and subsequently Oppenheimer's politics, as a more academic incursion than it historically was. In fact most of the things that were later called ""Communist"" by McCarthyists were done by folks who were at the time, or later in life, opposed to Bolshevik theory. Much of the work done in the labor movement before 1918 was done by Anarchists and varying Left-Wing organizers, with only very few taking a positive stance on Vladimir Lenin's October Revolution once it occured. Only later, starting somewhere around the stock market crash, did the Vanguardist Capital-C Communist movement gain traction in large numbers in this country. It seems that the historical J Robert Oppenheimer was probably not a Vanguardist, judging by his disavowal of communism after the war, and instead one of the many people who supported the Socialist movement at the time that had genuine solutions to the problems caused by Capitalism.One of those problems eventually ended up being fascism. Communists, Anarchists, Social Democrats, and all the other differing flavors of socialist rarely agree on much but they all could come together and oppose the rise of fascism and the culmination of this ideology in the Nazi regime. From the inception of left wing thought, authoritarian use of existing institutions were always used to quell the labor movement. In spite of the overwhelming force of monarchists and Liberal governments, Socialism persisted and labor struggles were won from time to time. So when fascism came knocking on the ruined doors in interwar Europe, all leftists understood the threat and what was at stake. One of the last efforts in the leftist struggle against fascism took place in Spain during the fascist overthrow of the republican (in the academic sense of the word, not the co-opted American sense) government. The father of fascism, Benito Mussolini, and Adolf Hitler supported Franco's fascists while the Republicans and Catalonia were supported by international leftist groups, trade unions, anarchists, and the Comintern. It was a precursor to WW2 where we had very clear sides with one being fascists and the other largely being working-class folks. And yet the Liberal governments of the time took a stance of neutrality because while fascism was a threat to civil liberties and minorities, socialism was a threat to Capitalism (the entire reason liberalism exists). You were either opposed to fascism or you aided it and as usual Liberalism's inaction allowed the strong centralization of fascism to blossom.All of this nuance could have been presented in this film but that would require Christopher Nolan to understand worker's rights beyond the labels of ""Communism, union, or left-wing"" which I know he does not. Nolan understands these concepts in the post-FDR context that we all today are stuck with, unless for some reason you take an academic interest in communism.In the film, Christopher Nolan presents trade unionism and Communism as somewhat intertwined. The Communists are treated as shady individuals and the Communist Party as a shady organization, even in the non-Strauss scenes. This is the framing of the McCarthyists and Christopher Nolan accepts it and presents it objectively. Nevermind the fact that historical J Edgar Hoover and McCarthyists were as racist and anti-communist as the Nazis. We get the presentation that Communists are somehow just as bad as Nazis, which is the incredibly asinine garbage one would expect to hear from post-FDR liberals and conservatives. We get a good deal of screen time devoted to Communist Party gatherings of professors at cocktail parties and (I think) just one union hall meeting of laborers, none of longshoremen strikes or factory workers that Oppenheimer also frequented were pictured, and almost no screen time of what the Communist Party was fighting against. It is all once again just presented as an academic exercise of talking about communism and none of the actual labor organizing that was very present throughout Oppenheimer's time at Berkeley. This is because Nolan wants to clearly indicate the difference between J Robert Oppenheimer and the Communist Party so he can present how unjust the trials against him were - which they were, but Nolan either doesn't understand why or doesn't agree with the reason why and wanted to substitute his own.The Red Scare of the McCarthy era and the suppression and oppression of left wing movements were unjust because Socialism is not fascism. This is something that J Edgar Hoover (along with many powerful individuals) probably disagreed with and since his FBI was the leader of domestic investigation, they treated Socialism like it was a major threat to humanity when it was only a threat to the status quo. So when the war was over, the pivot back from fascism to communism was made and this time with all the tools and energy used to find fascists were used against leftists. So when Cold War era rhetoric (or modern day rhetoric for that matter) demonizes communism it is inherently and intentionally baseless because communism has always been a threat to Capitalism and the status quo. J Robert Oppenheimer was unfairly persecuted for his communist ties, not because he wasn't a communist (he definitely was), but because persecuting communists is wrong. But Nolan cannot admit that, either because he doesn't agree or because he doesn't want to agree.All of that could have been avoided if Christopher Nolan didn't try to include a political thriller in this film. This could have been a movie about the moral implications of the atomic bomb (and it half is) but instead Nolan wanted to weave in the politics because that is what he was publicly attacked for in his day.To mix in the political elements, Christopher Nolan reuses the non-linear storytelling he perfected in Memento (2000). While that film used it to portray faulty memory, this film almost uses it to portray faulty investigations. And I think it is deliberate, because if Nolan had made this film more linear then it would be very obvious how stupid it is to make two movies in one. But he did it this way and I think everyone can agree that the Strauss portion of this film is probably the most boring and unnecessary. Nolan probably only wanted it to undermine the criticism of Oppenheimer that was leveled against him in his day and to glorify the man for modern audiences. He wanted to whitewash the father of the atomic bomb.And finally I can talk about what J Robert Oppenheimer is known for today: the Manhattan Project.From all accounts, the science of the film and the progression of discovery on the way to the bomb are all very accurate and well done. Despite how silly I think a lot of the scientidic dialogue is, I cannot deny that everything about the Manhattan Project, Los Alamos,"
"Witnessing the Oppenheimer was like walking between the two worlds, one is idealistic and genius while the other is a lasting nightmare where the consequences and actions sit on one man's heavy shoulders.Murphy was brilliant, if you think you'd loved him in Peaky Blinders you'll lose your mind over this one.Other actors performances were amazing and it's clear that a lot of effort, passion and planning went into this movie.Seeing this on a big screen is one of the best experiences I've had in a while, I've wanted to take a cigarette and ponder about a lot of things, staring into nothing (It's the Cillian's effect on me I'm afraid)If you are having any doubts if you should watch this, stop thinking and just buy a ticket, you'll understand once you see it. 🔥"
"Exceptional. One of Christopher Nolan's best movies. The cinematography is immaculate. The scenes are so crisp and intricate; can't believe they didn't use CGI. The cast, Cillian Murphy in particular, deserves an Oscar for that performance. In my opinion, the supporting roles of RDJ and Emily Blunt are also Oscar worthy, not to mention the spectacular portrayal by Matt Damon. The pacing, characters, cinematography, soundtrack, and story line exceeds expectations. This accurately paints a vivid picture of Oppenheimer's life and who he was. I think this film has a very good chance of being nominated and winning best picture at the Oscars next year. Go watch it on the biggest screen possible. A movie you won't regret seeing."
"Thanks for this movie , i enjoyed it, no doubt about that. But it was different than expected. Had in mind a more 'Dunkirk/Tenet´ type of movie. Missed the technology race against the nazies, the spies, the build-up to acutally dropping the bomb, the B29 Enola Gay story, the USS Indianapolis story, duck & cover, etc. So many stories behind this important part of history. Instead, lots of politics in a tiny board room and some kind of courthearings. But i should have guessed it from the movies title; it's all about the guy not about the bomb story. But as said, enjoyed it, but more 'Netflix' than a Nolan 'Blockbuster'."
"One scene in ""Oppenheimer"" kept my interest: the test detonation of the atomic bomb at Los Alamos. It's a testament to Christopher Nolan's skill as a director of action set pieces that he was able to make this moment almost unbearably suspenseful. After all, it's not exactly a spoiler to reveal that the test works.Unfortunately, that moment is preceded and followed by scene after scene after scene of old white men bickering and whining, turning Nolan's film into a bit of a boring slog, and a ridiculously long one at that. This film didn't need to be three hours long, and only is so that Nolan fans can convince themselves that it's yet another of his ""important"" masterpieces and justify paying exorbitant prices to see it in IMAX. Why anyone would want to see this movie in IMAX is a puzzle to me, since the whole thing is mostly just dudes standing around in brown offices talking.Thank god for Emily Blunt, who gets one scene where she finally shuts up all the men blathering around her. And Cillian Murphy deserves some credit for doing pretty well with the material he's given, though I took issue with the way the movie turns Oppenheimer into a hero and those who were against him stock villains. Despite Nolan's reputation for making thinking man's movies, this is not one. It tells you at every moment exactly what you're supposed to be feeling and what you're supposed to think about any given situation.You know, our planet is literally burning down around us as a I write this comment. Whether or not we ever use nuclear weapons on each other seems almost irrelevant in the face of climate catastrophe. I just didn't have the patience for the self-importance dripping from this movie, both from the characters in it and the people who made it.It will of course be nominated for a bazillion Oscars, because people convinced themselves that it was a masterpiece before it even opened.Grade: B-"

Don't miss the opportunity to experience the brilliance of ""Oppenheimer"" on the big screen - it's a journey you won't forget."
"After waiting for a year and seven months, I finally watched Oppenheimer, and it was totally worth every second of anticipation! The cinematography in Oppenheimer is a visual masterpiece. Each frame is meticulously crafted, immersing the audience into the world of the story. The way the scenes are shot and the use of lighting and color contribute to the film's captivating atmosphere.The chronological timeline of the movie is a true work of art. Nolan's seamless transitions between different periods in history not only keep the narrative engaging but also provide a deeper understanding of the characters and the historical events surrounding them. It's a brilliant storytelling technique that keeps you hooked from start to finish."
"I was intrigued to see what Christopher Nolan could do with a biopic about an important if perhaps little known figure from history. I vaguely knew the story but still learnt a lot. Give a theoretical physicist an unlimited budget, a tight deadline and get him to beat the Germans and Russians in turning theory into a real, working ""experiment"" which would quite simply change the course of history forever. Not a bad challenge.The science is clearly dumbed down enough so the general population can follow, which I think they did pretty well (though a physicist might say otherwise!). Add in a wonderful performance from Cillian Murphy and of course the genius that is Christopher Nolan and you get a very entertaining film. The soundtrack is magnificent as ever with Nolan and the film is beautifully shot. Some of the dialogue between Murphy and Damon is superb, even if Damon's portrayal of the brash army man was at times a little clichéd.I did enjoy the film and would recommend it. I think perhaps it didn't need to be 3 hours long. I think they could comfortably have shaved off 20-30 minutes without losing anything overall. Some of the post-experiment politics dragged a little for me. However I really am convinced Christopher Nolan is a genius and he's added a new string to his bow in taking on such a serious and potentially boring subject matter and turning it into an excellent movie experience. Well worth a watch."
"Unfortunately, the film is totally overhyped.I fell for it too.In retrospect, I wouldn't watch this movie in theaters again and I won't watch it a second time.Don't get me wrong. The movie is not bad. It's a good movie. But unfortunately, not more.The movie is supposed to be terrifying / horrifying / shocking? So for all people who have not lived behind the moon until today, it was already clear that nuclear weapons are nothing good and that it is with nothing at all to justify that the Americans have already used them 2 times and now play world police ... !I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan and have seen films as Prestige, Inception, Interstellar x times and will watch them again and again. These movies made me think after watching them and kept me thinking for a long time afterwards.This film here unfortunately does not occupy me at all, because I have not lived behind the moon until today as I said!----------Subsequent addition: Honestly, I would have rated the film 6 to 6.5 points.But due to the not understandable masses of 10 points ratings, I just had to give a 5.In the same way that the film didn't deserve an 8, 9 or 10, it didn't deserve a 3, 2 or 1. Just to make that clear."
"Me and a few of my friends saw Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" on opening night, in the IMAX format for which this film was intended. The feeling I have after having watched this film is something I can't really describe, nor do I know how I feel about the film as a whole. I feel as if this movie doesn't directly try to tell you whether or not Oppenheimer was a good or bad person, but allows one to decide this for their own. Same with the dilemma of building such a weapon of mass destruction.I think the visual portrayal of the atomic bomb was magnificent. The buildup to this moment was nerve-wrecking and really put me on the edge of my seat. And when it finally happened; quietness. It was the silence before the storm. For a moment, we get to see the beauty of it, and then we are hit with all the destruction and pain that can come with it; the shockwave. And I felt it coming too!We as an audience get to see it mostly from Oppenheimer's perspective, as I understand it. He doesn't look at the grand scale of it, but instead seems to recognize his dreams (and nightmares) in this phenomenon; the atoms and molecules floating around in harmony, just like he envisioned.I disliked the frequent and abrupt cutting between scenes and missed some prolonged, quieter scenes. Lee Smith's (previous editor for Nolan) absence is definitely felt throughout the film. This film also misses another genius who has frequently partnered with Nolan; Hans Zimmer. Though the soundtrack isn't on his level, Ludwig Göransson managed to deliver a beautiful score full of emotion and suspense. I'm yet to listen to it on Spotify since it hasn't released yet, but I know it'll be a great listen.The acting was splendid from every star that featured in this film-which were a lot. Cillian Murphy in the lead role is obviously a standout, and I wouldn't be surprised if this role lands him a lead actor Oscar (nomination). Another standout for me personally is Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Lewis Strauss. I don't know anything about Strauss, but Robert felt like an amazing fit for the role.I don't know how much of this story is completely factual, but I was intrigued and interested by it nonetheless. I can't wait to do more research about the subject matter, just like I can't wait to learn about how Nolan managed to make this film without CGI. I'm still processing this film, so for now my rating remains at a solid eight stars. Definitely an incredible thrill that one must face on the big screen."
"Is Oppenheimer a triumph in filmmaking?Yes.Is it one of the most important films of Hollywood?Probably.Is it Nolan's one of the best works as a director?As of now, I don't think so. But as with most of Nolan's movies, I believe that I'll appreciate this more on a rewatch.It is not the kind of story you'd expect from Nolan, but he tells it in his trademark style. The first act is filled with conversations and courtroom styled drama scenes. This should have been boring, but due to how these scenes are presented, the audience stays hooked. The editing and the quick transitions between scenes and timelines feel a bit confusing, but that's what Nolan was probably aiming for.The second act is much better and offers some of the most tensed and thrilling moments of the year. The whole Trinity test sequence is a masterclass in build-up, elevated by the glorious visuals of Hoytema, and deafening score from Goransson. I was awestruck.The final act is a complete horror film. A darkly funny horror film. There are some jump scares in the final hour which really caught me by surprise. The acting, dialogues, plot, cinematography, score; everything is too notch here. The 2nd act might be my favourite in the film, but the final act is definitely the most well made, technically.Overall, it's definitely a great movie and worthy of the major awards. Nolan gives another proof of why he's considered among the GOATs of directing. It does has some issues which are common in his other movies too; such as, expository dialogues, poor characterization, sound mixing concealing the dialogues etc. But it's such a well made film, that you can easily look past those flaws.Cillian Murphy and RDJ give career best performances. Emily Blunt is great too. The whole talented cast deliver great scenes, even though some of them feel underutilized. Hoytema is on his way to become one of the greats. Some of the shots here reminded me of Terrence Malick films. Goransson one again proves that he had the potential of reaching the level of Zimmer.This is a monumental piece of cinema."
"This was a movie that I was intrigued when I heard it was coming out. I do enjoy Christopher Nolan's films. I'm a bigger fan of Cillian Murphy though. I knew that this was a speculate so I was trying to see how I could fit this into my schedule. The three-hour runtime was daunting as well. The Gateway Film Center has been showing this on 70mm so I wanted to see it that way. The stars aligned on a Sunday for me to catch this.Now I'll be honest, I didn't know a lot about J. Robert Oppenheimer ahead of seeing this. I made the connection that he was part of the Manhattan Project, but outside of what happened with the atomic bomb being dropped twice on Japan and looking up a few things ahead of seeing this, I was a blank slate. Murphy does an amazing job at taking on this role. This could be his career defining performance to be honest.He's also surrounded by an amazing cast. His second wife is Kitty (Emily Blunt). He was also married to the amazing Florence Pugh who takes on the role of Jean Tatlock. That's just for his personal life. Robert brought quantum physics to the United States so we see him studying in Europe and meeting the likes of Werner Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighöfer) and Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh). We also see how smart Robert is and driven when he puts his mind to something.To just give a bit more about what this story is doing, we have two threads. The first is for the Manhattan Project to succeed in creating the bomb ahead of the Germans. There is also the concern with sharing too little or too much with the Soviets who were in the beginning an ally. Robert rubbed elbows with communists, but he never truly joined them. It was a fearful time though and McCarthyism was in full effect. The other tense thread involves Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) who wants to become a cabinet member. He hired Oppenheimer, but the two butted heads. Lewis plays the puppet master in getting Robert to lose his security clearance. This has greater ramifications as well.Aside from the names I've given here, we also have the likes of Scott Grimes, Jason Clarke, Tony Goldwyn, James D'Arcy, David Krumholtz, Alex Wolff, David Dastmalchian, Matt Damon, Dane DeHaan, Jack Quaid, Gustaf Skarsgård, Oliva Thirlby, Casey Affleck, Remi Malak and James Remar. I'm sure there's more as well, but that was a quick glance over the names.Where I'll leave off is that this is a tense movie about history. Did I need to see this in 70mm? Probably not, but I get to say that I did. There is an arthouse flair while still directing to the mainstream. Will this win awards? I believe that it will. It might not make as much as Barbie, which came out the same day. I will bet this is the better of the two movies. It's just not for everyone. This is a sad and uplifting tale of a man who was extremely important to the world of science and changed the world like none other. See this movie.My Rating: 9 out of 10."
"Oppenheimer Review: Very good movie, but be forewarned: it's long (3 hours) and very dialogue-heavy. People who aren't interested in history, who are distracted very easily, and who expect a lot of action will be disappointed. Every movie-making and storytelling aspect hit the mark. The cinematography, the musical score, the depth of characterization were all good. I only have one criticism, which is that the jumbled chronology of scenes made it kind of confusing for someone who wasn't paying attention or for someone who didn't have a basic knowledge of the story. However, the black and white shots coupled with the various location settings helped with this. Overall, an excellent film with a very important message: History is made by flawed and complicated people, who sometimes do bad things for good reasons, which can have both rewarding and terrible effects."
"Is Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer destined to be one of the best movies ever?That may be debatable - though I contend it is.What is undeniable is that is one of the most important films over recent years - a cinematic creation of rare intelligence and brilliant composition that poses timeless questions about technology and the capacity of humankind to control it.The story of Oppenheimer's fixation on the creation of the Atomic bomb and his subsequent misgivings of the super-destructive ""gift"" he gave the world is ever timely as we debate the dangerous future of AI and as invading dictators casually toss out ""tactical nuclear weapon scenarios"".Intricately non-chronological, Nolan's three-hour opus is assembled with all the precision of the complex super-weapon at the heart of his movie. Propelled by Ludwig Goransson's masterful score, the movie hurtles through time examining Oppenheimer's story and his contradictions. How did a brilliant man of good conscience lead the most destructive scientist project in human history - and what did that do to him?The performances are all excellent - as is, the overall historical accuracy of ""Oppie's"" amazing story.One last point. In a period when expensive Hollywood franchise films are floundering and losing oceans of money, Nolan's masterpiece shows what is possible when talented filmmakers - and not marketing executives - have control of the art form."
"Might sound absolutely blasphemous but I think this is better watched at home. This is not against the quality of the filmmaking, which was understandably amazing but the tediousness of it being an unintentional Oscar bait. There are tooo many characters, most looking similar and too dialogue heavy to be watching in theatres. The soundmixing leaves a lot of the dialogue to the imagination as well. What I expected from it was not what I walked away with, this is not about the bomb rather than the political side of the bomb. So be prepared to sit through endless courtroom back-and-forth with characters introduced in almost every scene. If you are not already aware of exactly what happened to Oppenheimer esp his life after the bomb, you're gonna have a really hard time understanding whats going on. Thats where the paradox lies, can it be a masterfully crafted movie if you lose your audience before the credits? Because it absolutely is and most around me absolutely were. And then if you are already aware of everything that happened to Oppenheimer was it really necessary to play the plot twist game with a certain character throughout the entire movie? The whole movie was a bit of oxymoron, you get to see what you prolly didnt want to and didnt get to see what you most wanted to. I'm talking about the bomb obviously, I was heavily disappointed by the absence of it. The saving grace was the amazing acting performance by RDJ and Emily Blunt who both should be receiving Oscar nominations. Cillian Murphy did a great job as well but there were many scenes where I felt like I was watching Tommy Shelby instead of Robert Oppenheimer. The best part of watching Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer was when he had no dialogues because his eyes do a better job at portraying what Nolan was going for. There is surprisingly little of the Nolan ""practical effect mindbending scene that needs to be seen in cinemas"". This was easier to follow and harder to watch than TENET.RATING: 7.5/10."
"I saw huge potential for a strong and emotional ride here. I went in expecting a nerve-wracking journey of doubt, guilt and conscience. A story of a man who basically had the fate of humanity resting on his shoulders, during one of the most intriguing moments in history.And sure, we get some glances of that throughout this 3 hour spectacle. But unfortunately Nolan seemed more interested in communist witch hunts and endless interrogations with nothing but a security clearance on the line. All while hiding behind his renowned fast and complex story structure that favors momentum and style over substance. As a result we get a somewhat bloated mixed bag, filled to the brim with way too many characters, ideas and plotlines. Culminating in a dragged out third act with a disappointing lack of emotion and stakes.The introverted, cold and sometimes arrogant Oppenheimer himself is also quite hard to understand and/or sympathize with. A lot of runtime is spent on trying to figure out his (perhaps) shady communist roots. Yet we still don't get a clear answer, or why we should care or how it could possibly matter in the grand scheme of things. Just like we're constantly being told he's a genius, but never really shown why. Or that he has a wife and a lover, but we never quite understand what they see in each other.It's like the film can't really decide what it is or what's important. A political thriller, an epic disaster movie, an intricate drama, or a psychological character study? It want's to be a lot of things, and all of them sure are interesting. But when non of them is given enough emphasis or time to develop in a satisfying way, it mostly comes off as a confusing pile of missed opportunities. On top of that, the editing is also very fast paced and few things on screen gets a chance to land properly, or give you any room to breath or reflect. This obsession of forward motion makes the whole thing feel pretty inorganic and calculated, and quite exhausting to experience.On the good side: It's good craftsmanship overall (as usual by Nolan), even though the IMAX format for this felt... Well a bit unnecessary to be honest, when the film is 90% driven by scenes of heavy dialogue in mundane settings. The cast is doing a fine job, and Murphys portrayal of Oppenheimer is pretty solid within the restraints of the script.The score is pretty good too, but overused and poorly mixed. In other words it follows the exact same pattern from Nolans latest film ""Tenet"" - where they also insisted on putting Ludwig Göransson's dramatic score all over the place, even on long dumps of exposition or dialogue. It's like Nolan is trying to inject the viewer with a false sense of tension or urgency into scenes that don't have any. It feels incredibly weird and disjointed at times, especially in scenes where it's basically a couple of guys sitting around a table.Not long ago, going to the cinema to witness Chris Nolans latest film was a no-brainer. You knew before you went in, without watching any trailers beforehand, that it will be worth your time and the price of the ticket. After Tenet and now this, I'm keeping my expectations in check..."
"Theres very few movies that have an impact on cinema like this one will. The star studded cast, direction, story and the other very pink opponent releasing on the same day. There are trends that Hollywood will try and manufacture unlike this freak chance of these movies being released on the same day. I truly hope that the film industry are taking note of true storytelling, heart and classic film making with little to none enhancements to the moments that truly matter.Where can i start with this cast, there can truly be 5 or 6 up for the 4 acting Oscars in 2024. Cillian Murphy is a shoe in for Best Actor, his harrowing portrayal of a genius that has the fate of the world on his mind and on-one truly understands the factors of what he has created. With a look he conveys a thousand words, with the support of Emily Blunt these 2 together weren't on screen a tone but yet again the impact they have on each others performances drive this to another level. From a sweet English legend (mary poppins) to an alcoholic American shows the breath of her acting range. When i heard the interview from RDJ that he was scared of taking this role and having to act again after his role as Iron Man this broke me. He smashed this role! In a film that spans hours his minutes on screen may beat Sir Anthony Hopkins Hannibal Lector record but the same impact across the board! Honorable mentions for Matt Damon, Jason Clarke and Alden Ehrenreich who keep all their stories flowing to allow a 3 hour film to be a a joy to watch.Then we come to an influential director that may be pushing for his Oscar with this film without making it Oscar bait like so many others in the past. If we get to Feb 2024 with people talking about this film its Nolans for the taking. Allowing natural, real and non-cgi scenery grounds this movie with the rawness on the forefront of movies just like the scientific breakthroughs that were happening on screen. Nothing has come close to this film this year! These are the films that when a director who writes his movies is allowed to create his vision and produces an epic. This is why he left Warner Bros. Over the last few years the medaling in directors creations stops the truest visions coming to realization.This is a word of warning though as proven by Thor Love and Thunder where Tiaka was allowed to run off and produce one of the dumbest marvel movies of all time!All of the effects have been highlighted as practical and this is the revaluation in bring back practical effects since Mad Max Fury Road in 2015. With the Atomic test being a practice effect i'd love to see how this is made. From visual effects to sound effects and editing, one word... perfection! Recently watching Interstellar and this had the same affect on me as that film!Theres no other words than prefect, actors, direction, story, score and above all the feeling of impending doom in a way that allows everyone to take a different take on who is right and wrong."
"Christopher Nolan, one film on from ""Tenet"", shows once again how skilfully he can bring mythological and complex scientific themes into the realm of cinematic glory.Oppenheimer is a dazzling crossover of the worlds of scientific theory, mythological epics, and harrowing practical realities. The audiovisual device and motif of light traveling faster than sound is ingeniously used by Nolan to illustrate how theory and reality don't always align foreseeably.Pet project aside, the story of the ""American Prometheus"" (J. R. Oppenheimer) needed to be told, especially in a way that grabs attention and turns heads; this truly matters; most definitely now in the midst of the knife-edge Atomic Age we collectively inhabit.The film couldn't be more relevant, especially when thinking about the ""Fermi Paradox"".As a biopic, this follows Oppenheimer's life and ascent through academia and his time in the Manhattan Project. Dialogue is spoken in a realistic, conversational volume but is still quite audible which serves to immerse rather than explicitly cater *to* the cinema-goer.This deceptive quietude is swiftly cut through like a knife by Ludwig Göransson's deliberately explosive score, showing the contrast between the humbleness, even of mankind's best and brightest, with the forces of nature beyond comprehension.Nolan takes his time to separate the man from the scientist, and we see Oppenheimer's vulnerabilities, egoisms, mythological fascinations (Bhagavad-Gita), and moral quandaries laid bare as his thinly veiled will to power reaches fruition. The film's sex scene particularly illustrates this.The lengthy three-hour runtime is almost an allegorical mirror of three-hundred years of development in the field of physics that culminates with the Manhattan Project.Nolan allows the audience to be, in an air of suspense, absorbed in the scientific breeding grounds - the hotly-contested, meandering theory, debate, and deliberation that gradually leads up to the final climactic event. What this amounts to is scientific poetry; yet Oppenheimer is more than a scientist; he is captivated by higher power and profound truths, things that lay beyond simply politics and science.Moral objections abound from the leading scientists of the day, and a slew of theories foreshadow, leaving something to the imagination about the tense atmosphere of the period, and what would come once the line had been crossed; the Rubicon crossed indeed.If anything could be changed, I would possibly depict the atomic arms race from the threefold perspective of Germany, USA, and the Soviets. But there's an argument to be made this takes away from representing the isolated uncertainty experienced at Los Alamos.The ending of the film is an astonishing commentary on the direction of scientific endeavour.8.5/10."
"After being a long supporting player and on TV's ""Peaky Blinders"" as now the former musician really is on the A List playing the titular character.His Oppenheimer is arrogant, cocky, and a womanizer but he is brilliant and smart despite let downs and people turning their backs on him as the father over in the nuclear bomb in dropping on Hiroshima Japan when the US was at war with the country after Pearl Harbor.Emily Blunt as his strong but long suffering wife and watching over their two children. Robert Downey as the college admissions director who hired him to teach and that he is really a sheep in wolves clothing.Matt Damon in a very rare supporting role as a US General hiring Oppenheimer while having doubts about him.Great support from people like Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett due for a comeback along with Alden Ehrenreich as an nameless aide.Jason Clarke as a ruthless and relenting prosecutor that leads the way over in the team trying to prosecute and discredit Oppenheimer. Tony Goldwyn also part of the team to also take him down.It is riveting and really shows in taking you all back to the 1940's. Christopher Nolan does it again."
"This movie is worth the whole hype. The acting is phenomenal, Cillian Murphy was outstanding and how the history construct is amazing.I though the 3h duration would make the movie tiring but you are attached to the narrative the whole time, the way characters are constructed and the time plots are really well done. The movie also shows many psychological and political aspects from the time and from the characters that can be easily brought to the present, it criticizes the extremism in the duality of our current political scenario.Definitely we will expect some Oscar nominations for Oppenheimer."
"Sorry, but the film is bad. As always, the director relies on heavy music the entire time to build momentum in the plot. That means, one must prepared to listen to loud orchestrated music for 3 hours, including during during dialogues. We know, one doesn't need music to boost a script, once the script is good. The story itself doesn't need three hours to be told. The film also started in high speed and ended in high speed. That means, you the audience do not need to create expectations towards climax - there is no such thing. The way it starts is the way it ends. Horrible. Emily Blunt was great, though. And so was Robert Downing Jr."
"This is a love letter to science and scientists. At times it reminded me of the recurrent joke in ""The Big Bang Theory"" about Howard not being a real scientist since he ""only"" holds a PhD in Engineering. I was a bit disappointed with the sound but it might be an artistic choice. Do words, does dialogue really matter when you are retelling how the fear of violence from one side pushed the other to unleash the most deadly and brutal attack on Japan. This is a well written movie though the ending is disappointingly cliche for a Nolan screenplay. Around the two hour mark. It felt like it was getting boring. It might benefit from some cuts. I would recommend it in a double bill with ""Hiroshima Mon Amour""."
"Christopher Nolan is a genius. The pacing, the cinematography and the acting all coming together for quite the spectacle. Oppenheimer much like the man is a complex, layered movie. I found that the non-linear storytelling really worked for me and it helped heighten the moments of tension. I really liked the choice of only showing the Trinity Test and not the actual bombings, and the consequences of developing and dropping those bombs. The last hour of the movie and especially the last few minutes before the credits roll are haunting and will sit with you.Cillian Murphy is just amazing. I have always been such a fan of his acting and I am glad he's getting his flowers by being recognized for this role. Robert Downey Jr was chilling as Lewis Strauss. He has successfully shed his much loved but campy Iron Man role and has reminded us all that he is a fantastic actor. Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh were also good to watch. And the many surprising cameos."
"Oppenheimer is a great film. The cast is stellar , the cinematography is top notch, and the sound editing might be the most underrated aspect of all. The theme of annihilation associated with the nuclear arms race still resonate today. The only issue was the running time of 3 hours. I felt the film could have been just as effective if it shaved off about 45 minutes. There is a lot of time devoted to a hearing to determine whether Oppenheimer gets to retain his security clearance. This may be an effective way to tell a story but the stakes of the ""trial"" never felt that high. Similarly there is confirmation hearing for the Secretary of Commerce played by Robert Downey Jr. That is simply not very interesting when compared to the high stakes development and testing of the nuclear bomb."
"I loved the movie. It was an amazing watch at least for me. I won't be biased as I cannot call myself a fan of Nolan though I have liked most of his previous works. But to begin with, this is not a typical Christopher Nolan movie. His earlier movies were more into visual appeals and how he captured the panoramic and action sequences. Such scenes allow the director to experiment and come up with breathtaking scenes for the visual hunger of the audience which worked in Nolan's flavor, although, although, here comes the mastery of his work, as the movie Oppenheimer was not his typical action, thriller, adventure genre of movie where he could use his already hit templates, rather this was a plain biographical movie and his usual hit template had no use in it. The movie demanded something else, which was never Nolan's forte or maybe we weren't shown as such, with Oppenheimer Nolan showcases what he is capable of, which is, he is capable of pulling up a thriller cinematic experience out of a rather normal biographical movie on life of a physicist. He did not use any of his previous templates but rather focussed mainly on the dissection of the character of not just Oppenheimer but also people involved in his life. The colours of the characters one by one appeared in front of you just as layers of onion appear and the final colours of the characters when juxtaposed made the movie come out in flying colours. This was a rather perfect example of how direction and storytelling can engross the audience so much in a movie as if you are living someone else's life. This 3-hour movie was a piece of artwork and for me is the piece de resistant of Christopher Nolan.Coming to the acting point, Cillian Murphy was absolutely on spot in portraying the multi-layered character of Oppenheimer, it appeared as if he was performing his heart out. And for me, this was Robert Downey Junior's best performance as an entertainer. The cast performed so well that the movie appeared as a theatrical performance. Not even once did I feel that these were the same actors whom I have already seen in some other roles like Iron Man by Robert Downey Junior. Each of the cast members even the ones with a few minutes of screenplay performed brilliantly. It was a treat to the eyes and heart how commendable their performance was.To bring to your notice I have to mention that the movie is not a visual treat rather it is a cinematic marvel, so unlike the popular opinion I feel that this movie can easily be seen in normal theatres and watching it in Imax is not at all necessary although imax would make the viewing more immersive but commendable storytelling and a great piece of art does not demand an imax. You can go watch it wherever possible. Another point to be noted is that this movie is not for the general masala movie preferring mass. This movie is an art movie and not an entertainment movie so anyone thinking that he or she would get the vibes of earlier Christopher Nolan's work here will be disappointed as this is not similar to any of his previous work. It might be boring for some audiences as the movie has elements of science and politics which if you are unaware of, you might end up being confused, so at least a person must have an understanding of nuclear fission/fusion and a general understanding of world war 2 and world's condition at that time. Knowing more about scientists like Bohr, Einstein will only make understanding of the movie easier. But again if you watch the movie attentively with all your focus you will get what the movie is showing. The cinematography is on point and perfect, I could not cut any marks on the cinematography. This movie is a clear 9 out of 10. The only negative in the movie is as I earlier mentioned, it is not everyone's cup of tea and will not be understood by the normal general mass.Overall the movie is not a casual watch, it is a beautiful cinematic journey and a brilliant movie which showcases that Christopher Nolan has the versatility and dynamism to produce a piece of art where it is hard to do so. For me, this is the best and most densely characterized biography I have watched to date. This is also a caution notice to anyone who thought Nolan will only produce a thrilling adventure movie throughout his career, this movie is different from his previous works yet excelled the expectations. I hope he still has more to give us."
"The movie was different from what I expected. I thought there was be more focus on the Manhattan project and Oppenheimer's role and less on Oppenheimer's personal and political life. It turns out the movie is almost exclusively about Oppenheimer's personal and political life.The sound is okay but nothing special. For the most part it's just really loud.The most exciting part of the movie happens about 2 hours in and is followed by about 40 minutes of boredom. The movie comes alive in the last 20 minutes.Overall, the movie felt long and less exciting than expected. It was easy to get lost and miss things if you didn't pay attention for just a moment. This is one of the few movies where you need to read the Wikipedia article about the person before watching."
"Nolan rarely does empathy well but this is a soulless three hours of men mumbling at one another. Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are wasted and portrayed as damaged souls. Scenes come and go barely registering on your conscience. Watching this movie is a bit like thinking back to you time in school where you were forced by your teachers to watch educational videos which were kind of okay but you'd rather be playing Lego or riding your bike. That's what watching Oppenheimer is like. It's like a three hour lecture with a bit of sex thrown in. Yes, it's a competent artistic film but that doesn't mean it's that good."
"I've been a big Christopher Nolan fan for a while (surprising, considering I'm a film bro, I know), but can't help but feel most of his offerings in the 2010s have been...in my opinion, weaker than his previous work. For me, films like Dunkirk and Tenet come off as cold nd lifeless, more interested in intricate film making than telling a compelling story. Nolan seems to actively want to alienate the audience with these movies. Interestellar and The Dark Knight Rises, on the other hand, almost feel too sentimental, betraying Nolan's characteristic fixation on logical storytelling for endings that seem like studio encouraged ""feel good"" endings that aren't necessarily earned.That's all to say Oppenheimer strikes the balance between Nolan's almost mechanical view of storytelling - with various parts moving in tandem to get to an end goal - with the heart and humanity to keep the audience invested. It's his best movie since Inception.Despite being 3 hours long, Oppenheimer was never boring or slow to me. If anything, one of the biggest issues with the film is its pacing in the beginning; it does feel somewhat edited like a movie trailer, jumping from scene to scene as we attempt to get an understanding of Oppenheimer's life. It does feel a bit too fast for the first chunk of the movie, but it's all worth it in the end. Once the main plot gets going, the movie really picks up its energy and something truly special. If I had one big complaint about this movie, it's the opening act (and to me, it's significant enough to hold this movie back from being a true masterpiece).Cillian Murphy is absolutely incredible as J. Robert Oppenheimer; he embodies the man to such an extent that he basically disappears into the role. He is Oppenheimer, by the end of the movie, just so total and compelling a depiction of this fascinating historical figure that it reminds me why biopics still matter, even if the genre itself has become a bit of a parody. Robert Downey Jr. Is also incredible in this movie, disappearing into the role of conniving head of the Atomic Energy Association and surely earning himself a Best Supporting Actor nod. I also really like Matt Damon in this movie; for such dense and sometimes difficult subject matter, he brought a warmth, charm, and charisma to his scenes that felt oddly comforting.To say this movie is STACKED with notable faces would be an understatement; the amazing thing is most of these people pop into the film for a scene or two and often, have extremely memorable moments in their own right. Florence Pugh's scenes are jarring, seductive, and sometimes disturbing, but I felt she was so crucial to the narrative. Emily Blunt playing Kitty Oppenheimer wasn't super impressive to me...until her incredible scene with Jason Clark during the questioning. My God, were they on fire there. Josh Hartnett pops in and brings that ""all-American boy"" pathos to the film and he's absolutely excellent. I could go on and on about all the actors in this movie, some very famous, who clearly just enjoyed the opportunity working with Nolan.If there was one performance I really disliked though, it was Gary Oldman as Harry Truman. Not only did he not really sound or look like him, but it was a rare ""over performance"" for this guy, who typically is fantastic as a character actor. I felt he was jarring and super distracting.I loved this film's cinematography, especially towards the end. There are so many iconic, visually stunning moments that stuck with me days after watching the film (i.e. Oppenheimer walking down the hallway, the entire assembly scene). But it's also interesting how overall, this film is very laid back and small scale (despite dealing with highly weighty themes), and will probably disappoint some expecting Nolan bombast. I personally didn't mind, but I would've been okay with a scene or two exploring the context of WHY the atomic bomb seemed necessary (*cough* my male brain wants some WW II action scenes for the IMAX *cough*).I also really liked how the film dealt with the politics and zeitgeist of the era; if you're fascinated by World War II and the early Cold War, as I am, you are in for a feast of references that only a history nerd could appreciate. It really captures what the time was like and how complicated our past really was. This is a movie that deliberately eschews the Great Man theory of history, instead putting Oppenheimer squarely within a social and political context that, even if he tries, he can never control or be above.But, I hope that instead of rolling your eyes and saying ""it was boring, it was confusing,"" it prompts audience curiosity and gets people to try and understand the history for themselves. Nolan does a tremendous job of distilling a complex man and a complex era into a historical epic; I really have to commend the man for having the confidence to make a 3 hour long, dialog heavy historical drama in the middle of summer, and have it be a BLOCKBUSTER.They don't make many Christopher Nolans anymore. Protect this man at all costs."
"It's only the middle of summer and we are almost half a year before the Academy nominations, but I think we already have one of the serious contenders for collecting many of the 2024 awards in Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer'. It's the kind of movies adored by American audiences and critics alike, the story of a great American adventure and the biography of a personality who made history. The biographical docu-drama brings to the screen the life story of the scientist who led the Manhattan Project and raises questions relevant then and relevant today about the responsibilities of scientists and the risks of research and technological achievements put at the service of militaries and governments. The cast features an impressive gallery of Hollywood stars, and the special effects sprinkled throughout the film give it an extra dimension of appeal (and a Nolan touch). There are also plenty of political drama aspects, but ultimately the main qualities of this film, the ones that will remain after the initial excitement wears off, are related to the extremely truthful and well-documented portraits of the personalities who contributed to the success of the Manhattan Project.The story in 'Oppenheimer' is structured in three temporal planes that unfold in parallel with dizzying speed. The biographical plot begins in the 1920s, Oppenheimer's years of study in Europe, and ends in the months after the end of World War II and the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The staged 1954 investigation into a secret committee aimed at denying the scientist, who had become uncomfortable by his pacifist political views, an extension of security clearance to allow him access to and collaboration with US nuclear programs constitutes the second level. Finally, the 1958 public hearings for the Senate confirmation of the politician Lewis Strauss - initially a supporter, later a personal enemy of Oppenheimer and the main person responsible for his downfall - represent the third plan. The second and third levels provide the flashbacks that recreate the first. Throughout the development of the biography are interspersed short and spectacular images that visually project Oppenheimer's thoughts: the mysteries related to the structure of the universe on a sub-atomic scale and on a cosmic scale in the first part of the film and the nightmares of destruction during the dawn of the atomic age. The result is a three-hour film in which the sequences often follow one another with the rapidity of video editing, while in other cases, long, documentary-like scenes record the endless debates in secret or public commissions. Color and black and white alternate to give the feeling of authenticity. 'Oppenheimer' seems like an encyclopedia of editing styles, but all adapted to the purpose. Spectacular, even impressive at times, but not easy to watch.Do we understand Robert Oppenheimer, those around him and the era they lived in better after watching this film? Probably yes, in some ways, but not completely though. The book that inspired the film, 'American Prometheus', one of the many biographies and science books written about the scientist, has over 700 pages. Some aspects of the scientist's enrollment in the program, personal life and collaboration with his contemporaries are well rendered, others are treated superficially or completely ignored, such as those related to Oppenheimer's Jewish identity or his decisions to abandon fundamental scientific research in favor of the managerial practicalities of the military program (for this reason Oppenheimer never received a Nobel Prize). Cillian Murphy got into the character's mind and soul perfectly. The gallery of actors around him played their roles with precision: Robert Downey Jr. In the complex role of Lewis Strauss; Matt Damon as an excellent General Groves, Oppenheimer's military partner; Benny Safdie - very accurate and expressive as Edward Teller, Oppenheimer's rival (except for the biographical detail that Teller limped because of an accident in his youth, a detail omitted in the film); Gary Oldman with one single but memorable scene as President Harry Truman. The scenes that take place at Los Alamos during the work on the project and especially in the days and hours leading up to the first atomic explosion are formidable. The dilemmas of Oppenheimer and of his colleagues regarding nuclear weapons and the race between superpowers that has led to the balance of nuclear terror and the possibility of the destruction of all life on the planet are well brought to the screen. My feeling was that some of the aspects of American domestic politics are presented in too much detail and get lost, especially given the length and pace of the narrative. I have read some reviews where it is mentioned that details missed initially can be noticed or understood better on a second viewing. That would be true with many movies, but most moviegoers can't afford or don't want to watch a three-hour movie twice (or more!) times. I think that in this case two hours more filtered to the essentials would have been a more suitable format. 'Oppenheimer' is a remarkable film in many ways, but in this case I don't believe that size added quality or depth."
"When I was at school in Scotland in the 1970s there was a textbook called physics is fun,I never agreed with this book.Nolan is not the first person to tackle this story,the BBC did a 6 part series in 1980 called Oppenheimer,in 1989 Paul Newman made a film called fat man and little boy.These productions are obscure and I don't mind Nolan covering the story.This is a great film but it lacks pace and drama.It is a 3 hour film divided between 1 part Oppeheimer's life before the Manhattan project,1 part about the Manhattan project and the final part Oppenheimer's fall from grace.This is a complex and detailed story but I can't say Nolan handles it well.I have see the previous versions of this story and wrote an essay about the decision to bomb Hiroshima when studying history at university.I also have a good grasp of the events of WW2 and the Cold War.So the issues covered in this film are not new to me but the level of detail is sometimes numbing.The final third of the film covers Oppenheimer's post war problems and this section drags.The film is very well made but it lacks enough memorable scenes.The sound and music are exceptional.This is a biopic and what are we to make of the character of Oppenheimer?He seems to have been an arrogant genius who was a womaniser who had several public faces displayed at different times.The film has a large cast and it is hard to work out who is who at times.But all in all I say is that this is a great film despite it's flaws."
"The actual story needed to be told. But it would have been better a 2 hour linear docudrama, than a 3 hour mysterious storytelling adventure where the director keeps us in his thrall with his cutting, and his use of color to depict time. The science, which is actually the most important character in the story, is almost totally excluded. The scenes meant to describe fission processes, were not related to fission at all. Dark stars aren't relevant. Neither is the physics of how stars work, because stars work by fusion, and this is a story about fission. The atomic bomb was inevitable, given the continuing discoveries by nuclear physicists. A few years There was a time, shortly before the Manhattan project was funded, the we didn't know if it could work, theoretically. But that wasn't made a part of the Oppenheimer story. Churchill's refusal to share with the Russians thru into the Cold War sill are threatened by."
"Barbenheimer is deemed this year's biggest cinematic event, and the two distinct films have both exceeded my personal expectations. More than I hoped for- Oppenheimer is a gripping, intense psychological drama. While not for the faint of heart and sometimes hard to watch, it is sure a film that is to change our modern cinematic Hollywood landscape. Oppenheimer's striking, unique filmmaking techniques, effects, and cinematography leaves viewers in awe or shock while truthfully aiding in the storytelling. Although the storytelling and structure is non-linear, I found it not too difficult to follow along to and carefully and cleverly crafted. The sound design of the film is phenomenal and sometimes unexpected (in a remarkably sensational way that shifts perspectives of events). Ludwig Göransson's soundtrack was absolutely essentially to the dramatization of the story and events. The stellar screenplay and performances truly shined through Nolan's insane direction of the film. Although the first act felt a bit slow at times, I was blown away by the film at the end and was left wanting more, hoping it would not end. Oppenheimer revealed more depth than I imagined by exploring the leading character's moral dilemmas and the effects of the political landscape at the time. While not necessarily for all ages or types of audiences, Oppenheimer is fresh, absorbing, notable, and must be seen in the theaters on the big screen."
"I entered the movie theatre expecting a great movie about the nuclear bomb and its impact on Oppenheimer, but no, it was actually about Oppenheimer and his impact on himself and the world around him.The Best biography film I have ever seen, the best Nolan movie and more importantly the best of this year.Every character is well served and all got a great drama, influence, and performances.If Cilian Murphy didn't get his Oscar this year it will be one of the greatest crimes in the history of the academy awards that exceeds the crime of not nominating Jake Gyllinhal for Best Actor on his role in Nightcrawler.RDJ didn't lie when he said that's the best film he has been in and he had his best performance too and my man made Zodiac!I was shocked by Emily blunt as I bever thought she got that performance in her.Florence Pugh's character maybe is not what I expected, she didn't get to show us her incredible performance that we used to see it as her screentime was incredibly short, and her drama isn't served so well yet so influential.I stongly recommend this movie for any film fans, and if you could attend this movie in IMax theaters u will have the best experience ever as the music pumps in your heart."
"This film is a true visual and intellectual masterpiece from Christopher Nolan. The film is a biography of the man's life from his time as a young academic right up until the atomic bomb creation and him losing his security clearance after the war. Cillian Murphy's portrayal is exceptional of a man who started off a misfit and became the most famous man in the world. There are different time lines in this film, that can confuse the viewer. If you pay attention and are interested in the subject matter this film with really assault the senses and the mind. Nolan created some exceptional visuals of the recreation of the atomic bomb Trinity test in the desert in New Mexico. The other performances were also outstanding. Florence Pugh was great also and the sexy lover of Oppenheimer. She oozes sex appeal and portrays her character with emotional depth, for a woman who had mental health issues.Robert Downey Jnr as Strauss who helped Oppenheimer with the Manhattan Project but then tried to take him down after the war. He may have given the performance of his career. I loved the visuals and the black cinematography at times, used with colour as well. I loved the set design, the costumes and the classic style cars. I could go on and on about how great I think this movie is and I can't wait to see it again. Nolan has created a 3 hour epic about a man who grappled with changing the course of human history. I hope this film gets many Oscar nominations and I think it is the best film of the year so far."
"Christopher Nolan, known for his technical brilliance, delves into the biographical genre for the first time with ""Oppenheimer."" putting a unique spin on the portrayal of the legendary figure. One notable aspect of Nolan's directorial style is his ability to focus on characters and their emotions. Similarly, he successfully attempts to depict the complex character of Oppenheimer, who, in reality, had two distinct sides.The first aspect celebrates Oppenheimer's role as the creator of the most powerful weapons known to mankind, while the second part sheds light on his realization that humanity now possesses the capability to potentially destroy the entire planet. Classic Nolan handles this duality of Oppenheimer's character amazingly, making the movie a thought-provoking experience for those who appreciate historical biographies and the moral dilemmas they present.Coming to the acting, I must say it's a masterpiece! The fusion of top-notch actors is exceptional, and everyone seamlessly belongs to that era. Cillian Murphy is absolutely perfect for the role; he elevates the film to new heights with his phenomenal performance, making it a true cinematic gem that will be remembered for years to come. And RDJ, his new avatar and performance solidifies the film's status as a cinematic gem. Their performances together are simply extraordinary, adding an unforgettable layer of brilliance to the movie.In summary, ""Oppenheimer"" may not appeal to everyone, but for science enthusiasts and history buffs, it offers a compelling and emotionally engaging cinematic experience.Nolan's masterful direction and the portrayal of Oppenheimer's complex character make this movie a worthwhile watch for those intrigued by historical and scientific narratives."
"This movies is not about making bombs or awesome explosion scenes. It's about limp-wristed scientists and aristocrats pointing the finger at each for being communists. They barely talk about bombs at all and when they do it's vague and cuts immediately. If you want go see iMax screens of people's faces arguing who's a communist and who's not this movie is for you, if you were expecting something like Interstellar I apologize. On the other hand if you ignore what I said and can enjoy the acting and cinematography then by all means go for it. This can still be a great movie, I just went in with very wrong expectations."
"Like some of the director's other films, but this was a directorial and editing disaster. I saw the 70mm IMAX version, but the IMAX big-screen features were not used well in this film. It wasn't necessary to see it on a big screen. You would think the bomb scene would make use of the screen, but it was a dud.The film uses extensive flash-forwards and flashbacks, as well as black-and-white and color sequences. Both techniques were unnecessary and confusing, but that seems to be the current fad.The first hour and a half of the film is mostly about politics and investigators, which is not my interest in this story. I wanted to know about how the bomb was built. That part of the story takes up about an hour, and it was made as dull as possible. Then we are left with more investigations of people in small rooms for half an hour at the end.The script was mediocre, leaving not much for the actors to do. Some gratuitous sex was thrown in, for no reason that I could discern. The opening apple story likely never happened in real life. It's ridiculous to think so. Over 20 people at Los Alamos gave their lives in the process of making the bomb, and they aren't mentioned at all. Some died from radiation poisoning. Einstein's letter to FDR, which started it all, is not mentioned at all.The movie spends way too much time on the boring Strauss character. I guess it was because of who played him. The movie is just a hodgepodge of scenes jumping from times and places, slapped together without much thought to a story arc. It should have been a great thriller."
"Those complaining about this film not passing the Bechdel Test and being too boring, would make the same complaints about the classic 12 Angry Men. Those complaining about the nudity in this film have completely missed the point. The film shows Oppenheimer as a slightly awkward person who used his intelligence as his charm with women. The first sex scene was as expected, slightly awkward almost like the first time you lose your virginity. In the book, Oppenheimer, experienced abusive pressure from his mother in who he should date. The first sex scene is them barley nude with her in-control and dominating him. The later is them both equally comfortable and fully exposed to their core with each other. Like the bomb he's building...they're drawn together, attracted to each other, and when connected sensational things happen, but they're destructive to each other and to those around them. The fact we're still talking about it, proves it was a psychologically effective visual of seeing Oppenheimer and his mistress both on top of each other in that hearing room with Emily Blunt staring directly into her eyes. It's about exposure, to their core, and then to the world.Also, Cillian Murphy showed more nudity in 28 Days Later than in this...grow up.Back in the early 90s, Oliver Stone made a profoundly engaging political thriller, JFK. One of the best films of all-time, and one of the best film edits of all-time. The fact that Oppenheimer gave me vibes of Oliver Stone's JFK, speaks volumes of this epic opus from one of the few directors in Hollywood who audiences can still count on to make an above average film and not sell out to cheap gimmicks. Also, to hardcore Nolan fans, this is not Inception 2 or the next Dark Knight feature. Nolan has taken another larger step in the world of cinematic storytelling.Christopher Nolan has made some of the greatest films in his career. The Dark Knight, Inception, Momento, and Dunkirk. Despite The Dark Knight being one of my all-time favorites, Oppenheimer might just be Nolan's masterpiece of storytelling cinema. Oppenheimer, is not an action pack thrill ride like The Dark Knight and Inception. It's not a insane, complicated narrative like Tenet. Not drowning in complex science like Interstellar. It's not a simple story/history recount with minimal character focus like Dunkirk. Nope, Oppenheimer is Nolan's adaptation of the book American Prometheus, and the source material makes this one of Nolan's best screenplays for him to work off of. This is the most fascinating dive and study of a character I have seen in a Nolan film to date. However, when the film is intense, it's gripping. For a 3 hour film, it's never boring or jarring. Its non-linear editing, sparking JFK vibes, keeps your engagement fully tuned, and leaves you enthralled from each scene. Oppenheimer sparks the dark conspiring thriller notes of JFK, with the mathematical background of A Beautiful Mind, and with a Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life style approach.Cillian Murphy gives a career high performance amongst an absolutely astonishing cast which includes phenomenal performances from Robert Downy Jr, Emily Blunt, and even a fantastic returning performance from Josh Hartnet. Even the back end of the cast features multiple Oscar winners. Gary Oldman, Casey Affleck, Kenneth Branagh, and Rami Malek. Along with several other talented named actors.It's that great of a film and character study. Take away Nolan's name from the film and I would still say this. The man who ended WWII, saving possibly millions of lives by ending hundreds of thousands of lives, only to feel guilt and then allow the world to shame him for his controversial gifted brilliance. There is a lot to take from Oppenheimer. In a pretty lackluster year, Oppenheimer is already and easily the film to beat."
"Some of the things I think are good about this movie:
Nolan's approach of CGI minimalism.The awesome acting by its cast members, I especially think Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and Jason Clarke as the highlights of the actingFantastic choice of B&W/color scenesHaunting and awesome score by Ludwig GöranssonThe dialogues that represent the politics, dilemmas, dissent, and scientific discussions that go behind the Trinity testBut I can't help but to feel that something feels incomplete/off about the pacing and portrayal in the movie, it feels like some scenes are too lengthy and sort of dominate other aspects of the story that should have gotten more screen time instead. I mean, don't get me wrong, this movie is awesome and it definitely immerses people into Oppenheimer's great and tragic life story and shows how important of a person he was, but it feels like there is an imbalance in the storytelling and how long things are told. It feels like considering the significance of the story of Oppenheimer, there is something that feels imbalanced in the film."
"I went into the movie with high expectations and overall it did deliver well.Pros: special effects, story, acting, casting, cinematography, soundtrack/music, ending was well doneCons: the beginning was a little messy for me, the audio for the dialogue could've been clearer - it was hard to heard several scenes, the writing for female characters in the story could've been strongerI do think Nolan missed a few good opportunities in terms of making this movie a masterpiece, but the acting by all the actors, the special effects and the story will be remembered by many viewers for years to come."
"I read the book on which the movie was based, and this film is exactly as I imagined it, and it was almost perfect yet as good as it will ever get.Nolan skipped some of my favorite parts of the story and narrative, but he kept the important ones and those that were significant to Oppies' personal life.I'm pretty sure that this film will get mixed reviews because it is definitely not for everyone because it is so dialogue-heavy, and to get the right picture of the narrative, you'll pretty much have to listen carefully to every single word that is said in the film. Second of all, I think the film might be confusing because of its constant shifting between three continuous storylines that take place years apart from one another.I certainly hope this film will be a wake-up call for the masses about how a war in the present is way deadlier than prior to the historical events that the film depicts."
"Oh my god... where do i even start !!Cillian Murphy was the best casting for Oppenheimer. He portrayed him perfectly. The other castings were great too !! So many familiar faces throughout. Emily Blunt did a fantastic job playing Kitty. AND ROBERT DOWNEY JR AS LEWIS ?? Amazing. Absolutely amazing.This is a film that you definitely need to watch in the cinema; or at least with surround sound. Because the atmosphere is intense !! The sounds of the bomb tests, the visions that Oppenheimer has. Wow.The vfx were incredible too !! The moments of silence, like during the bomb test or when Oppenheimer does a speech after the bombs are dropped on Japan, where we get into his head and feel what he's experiencing were done phenomenally.I can't wait for shows like the Oscars, because i can guarantee that this film will wipe the board."
"A film like Oppenheimer can easily be regarded as a well made film, but is not for everyone. Rating it based on filmmaking, then it's a 10 and that's where I will stay personally, too. Certainly there are things that could be changed to ""make it better"", but the decisions that were made by Nolan were the correct ones narratively.The purpose of the film is not about creating the bomb, but its true intentions, other than being focused on Oppenheimer, are not truly revealed until the third act. The characters and their ideals drive the plots forward in a very interesting way. Revealing how people, especially the physicist and scientists, act in this place and time fits the structure of the story to a T. We don't need to know the direction that the film is going since we already know the end. Who Oppenheimer is and how he communicates with those around him is all the audience needs for the first hour and the next hour, dealing with the bomb, is paid off dramatically based on our personal experience with these characters. There's a lot of plot, but not much story, which is exactly what this film needed.By the time we get to the true meaning of the film and why it's told as a drama rather than a documentary is realized in its third act. It's a human story that will make you question history and not so much the ""how"" of the bomb, but the ""why"". The 3 hour journey is a completely original experience. It's an audio and visual experience that doesn't let go of its audience. You will be forced to watch the movie at a high volume or with subtitles, but the payoff of a loud 3 hours spent with Oppenheimer is relentlessly rewarding. While it may not be for everyone, it is a film made perfectly for what Nolan was going for, and it's ""perfect"" for that reason alone."
"Telling the story of a larger-than-life individual truly calls for a larger-than-life film, and that's precisely what writer-director Christopher Nolan has come up with in his latest feature outing, handily the best work of his career. Nolan's three-hour opus about the life of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), director of the Manhattan Project (and more commonly known as the Father of the Atomic Bomb), provides viewers with a comprehensive biography of this brilliant and thoughtful yet often-inscrutable and naïve physicist who took on a patently dangerous venture that left him morally conflicted about the nature of his creation. The story, which spans several decades of the scientist's life, chronicles his development of ""the gadget"" and the fallout he suffered as a consequence of his left-wing political leanings and his efforts to keep the released nuclear genie from getting out of control. The film is admittedly a little overlong and probably could have used some editing in the opening and final hour, but, in the interest of telling the whole story of Oppenheimer's odyssey, its length is understandable (and, consequently, justifiable). The picture's production values are all top shelf, especially its brilliant cinematography, stirring original score and superb sound quality, an element that truly leaves audiences with a bona fide visceral experience. Moreover, the narrative is skillfully and eloquently brought to life by this offering's outstanding ensemble cast, including Murphy, Matt Damon, Tom Conti, Benny Safdie, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, and, especially, Robert Downey Jr., who delivers a stellar, award-worthy supporting performance showing acting chops that I never knew he possessed. ""Oppenheimer"" is easily the best film of the summer movie season, if not all of 2023 thus far. It packs a potent punch and delivers a message that we can all never hear too often, poignantly reminding us all of the importance of not falling prey to the same Promethean burden that Oppenheimer was forced to shoulder."
"This is not a perfect movie. There are perfect movies in the sense that if you take something out of them or add something in, the movie will get worse. I think Memento for example, was a more perfect movie than this one, and to a certain extent so was Dark Knight. This does not make them better movies than this one; I think this movie is around the same level or better.This movie also is not an action movie or a cookie cutter thriller or whatever passes for entertainment nowadays in our low IQ society. In a way this is a gem in the sea of cr4p that is produced by the current culture of today. It's a thoughtful work of art. If I could never have watched any Marvel movie and watched this instead I'd do it in a heartbeat."
"Oppenheimer was one of the most disturbingly deep and real movies I have ever seen. It took a dive into imagination and growth, social and political turmoil, the unstoppable human struggle for achievement, ethics of power, and the terrible reality of fear and aspiration. I expected a film focused on the bomb itself with Oppenheimer's life as a small support. I'm glad I was wrong. This movie showed the full story. The good, the bad, and the ugly truth of life of Oppenheimer and everyone around him. Everything makes sense now. After decades important things lose their significance and seem to be mundane but I'm genuinely amazed and afraid of what humanity can do now."
"You have one of the greatest scientific achievements in history and you use it as a background for a boring courtroom drama?So much if the film is Oppenheimer feeling guilty and conflicted, like that's some fresh take on the situation. When it's a given.Nolan also goes back to all his typical tricks - jumping around the timeline, 1-dimensional women, needless nudity, and an overbearing soundtrack. Showing he has not grown as a Director/Writer at all.Cillian Murphy seemed to struggle in the role, he comes across as very bored and his character doesn't feel like a genus at any part of the film.A lot of the big names take you out of the film, but all the other scientists in smaller roles played their parts well.It's an ok film, but they should've focused on making the bomb, like the trailer implies."
"As a science nerd and someone who used to be obsessed with the Manhattan project, nuclear bombs etc. This really couldn't have been much worse. There were maybe 15 minutes of interesting tidbits related to themes Oppenheimer actually dealt with in his life and the rest was just garbage. It's like they tried to make it into a romcom/political film that had very little to do with the actual interesting parts of Oppenheimer's life. I won't write spoilers, but I promise you there is not much to spoil. Endless drivel, dialog that literally put me to sleep for a few minutes.If you're interested in science and tech, just skip it. If you're interested in a good drama, skip it. If you like dull trials with too many actors and are really into dudes yelling every 5 minutes about ""russia"" or ""communists"" then go for it."
"Oppenheimer, a breathtaking three-hour marvel, undoubtedly represents Christopher Nolan's magnum opus as a director. Throughout the film, the audience is seamlessly drawn into the protagonist's journey, becoming emotionally invested in every decision he makes. Divided into three major set pieces, the narrative gracefully unfolds, chronicling his ascent, the arduous path to achieving the unimaginable and earning the mantle of an American hero, and finally, confronting the impact of his legacy as history smirks on.The cast's performances are exceptional, each actor embodying their roles with poise and excellence, making it hard to distinguish them from their on-screen personas. However, it is Cilian Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer that adds an extraordinary layer to the story. His compelling performance captures the essence of the character, allowing the audience to feel the struggles and downfall of this enigmatic figure.Nolan's storytelling prowess shines throughout, guiding viewers on an unforgettable cinematic journey, leaving a profound impact. Oppenheimer is not merely a film; it's an immersive experience that lingers in the minds and hearts of its audience long after the credits roll. A testament to exceptional storytelling and outstanding acting, Oppenheimer cements its place as a cinematic triumph and a remarkable addition to Christopher Nolan's illustrious filmography."
"History is uncomfortable, it's painful but the truth must be spoken one way or the other. The public is very well aware of the consequences of the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima but what went behind the doors, the bureaucracy and the challenges it faced was unclear until I saw this movie. I'm not saying everything in the film was factually correct but it painted an important lesson that the atomic bomb is not something to play with. The audience is too busy criticizing the naked body of Florence or the cinematic performances of the film, they are missing out on the actual point the film is trying to deliver which is that the scientists did not live their lives celebrating the death of thousands but rather spent their lives trying to correct the wrongs, trying to keep the dangerous weapon from being played on the field ever again. The line ""They wont fear it until they understand it. They wont understand it until they've used it"" - sums up the entire film and the logic behind the decision. Oppenheimer was a genius but also a complicated man but how could you not be when you possess such intelligence - the film also did a fantastic job on illustrating this."
"Well! Oppenheimer is excellent! Certainly lives up to the hype.All Nolan films are haunting, haunted, and different. Oppenheimer is in the mould. Cilian Murphy is centre stage here and he is brilliant! Oscar I think? He is centre stage - but he doesn't carry the movie. The cast is strong and acting excellent. Photography - excellent, beautiful - especially in New Mexico. Story and storytelling - excellent. This is a great movie!Why only 9/10, and not 10/10??? For me, a film has to be able to live with the very best in order to get a 10. Although Oppenheimer is excellent - it wasn't quite up there, wasn't quite what I was expecting. That can be fine - don't have to always get what you expect! But here, the female characters are not well framed. Emily Blunt is a brilliant actress - but she deserved better than her horrible little cameo. There is another female character who gets even worse treatment, and one final one who gets 15 seconds on the screen. But that's it!Although the soundtrack is superb - it's overpowering and obtrusive. That's a real shame.Even so, Oppenheimer is powerful. There are a lot of characters - it's tricky to keep up. The timelines jump around too - but that's just one of Nolan's normal tricks. Go and see it and see what you think."
"Let's be honest here. This isn't your average World War II film; filled with violent war scenes and American nationalistic themes.This is a slow-building biopic about one man's genius being imparted on one of the most noteworthy endeavors of the 20th century - The Manhattan Project, which resulted in the atomic bomb.Oppenheimer is well-produced, well-acted and beautifully shot. Cillian Murphy emits the perfect disturbed look that Oppenheimer has become famous for, and the attention to detail surrounding his character is on point.The only negative aspect of Oppenheimer is how much it can demand your attention. Because it's so rich, it's very easy to miss something important. If you miss a few details about the intricacies of the story it can ruin the immersion. However, the second time through makes it much more understandable.All in all, this is a solid Nolan movie and a great addition to his ever-growing library of classics."
"""Oppenheimer,"" directed by the brilliant Christopher Nolan, is a cinematic masterpiece that delves into the intriguing story behind the creation of the atomic bomb during the Manhattan Project.

With its captivating performances, compelling narrative, and remarkable depiction of history, ""Oppenheimer"" undoubtedly deserves 9 out of 10-star rating."
"Oppenheimer is being treated as if it is another Christopher Nolan Film Bro Prestige Blockbuster. The semi-sarcastic viral marketing has sold it as the male answer to Greta Gerwig's Film Sis blockbuster, Barbie. And wouldn't it be nice if Nolan's much-anticipated new film was the next in the line of mind-bending action epics that have given the director his ""must see"" cred. But, for better or worse, Oppenheimer is a long, long way from The Dark Knight, Inception, Interstellar, Dunkirk, or Tenet.This new film is something very heavy, very serious, and very grandiose. It shares those qualities with much of Nolan's signature pictures. However, those buying a ticket for Oppenheimer expecting filmic thunder and lightning and spectacular visual scope will be let down by what the film actually is. In effect, Oppenheimer is something almost uncomfortably intimate. The subject is Robert Oppenheimer, brilliant scientist, leader of The Manhattan Project and Father of the Atomic Bomb. Cillian Murphy inhabits the character handily. It's the role of a lifetime for Murphy, one of those miracles of casting where an actor who has put in great work over the course of a career is rewarded with a part that will define him for all-time. It's an inward performance, emphasizing internal struggles-not only Oppenheimer's moral dilemma in creating the bomb to end all wars, but his personal tribulations and the political pressure that had closed in on him in the post-war years. He makes superb use of his physical look; utilizing those sunken eyes and gaunt frame with face and body language that illustrates inner uncertainty. You couldn't have asked for a better melding of actor, material, and performance.In its 3 hours, Oppenheimer zeros in on the development of the atomic bomb, from the early scientific breakthroughs that made it possible to the military strategy involved, the questions of security, fears of espionage, and the political repercussions of its ultimate detonation. It is a movie entirely made up of critically important conversations, and for that reason, it is an actor's dream project. The lineup here is about as good as it gets in this star-starved Hollywood era. Robert Downey Jr. Is the revelation of the cast as Lewis Strauss, a mysterious figure who lurks on the peripheries of the story until coming into startling focus in the third act. It is easily the best acting of RDJ's career, and an incredible reassurance of his talents after a string of bad performances in bad movies. The supporting cast is unusually stacked with big-name actors doing the type of stuff they got into the business for. Emily Blunt ought to earn an Oscar nomination for her work as Oppenheimer's fed up alcoholic second wife, looking unattractive and coming off as an unpleasant burnout. Matt Damon also redeems his recent misfires with some strong, modulated energy. The bit parts are too many and too good to earn anyone special recognition, but Kenneth Branagh, Jason Clarke, Josh Harnett, Dane DeHaan, Casey Affleck, and Gary Oldman in a single unforgettable scene, are joys to watch.The most apt comparison for Oppenheimer's urgent, dialogue driven feel is Oliver Stone's JFK. The experience of watching the film is similar; you are caught in the grip of these discussions, and the director, in both cases, doesn't give you space to check out. ""Pay attention to what these people are saying. The fate of the world is on the line."" Nolan makes that energy work, although not with quite the level of craft that Stone showed in his film. Of course, as writer, Nolan can't resist time-jumping between Congressional hearings and science lectures and political machinations, but thankfully these mixed-up threads (some presented in black-and-white) make dramatic sense and sharpen the impact of the film's ending.Oppenheimer is a better written film than it is directed. That's new territory for Christopher Nolan, who has made a career out of endowing basically intelligent action movies with grand visual might. He doesn't do much to amaze us here. His best visual ideas come in the form of recurring symbolic images such as ripples in a puddle, marbles in a glass, or the nuclear chain reaction of the bomb itself. These are simple ideas that convey great meaning. All very deft and powerful. What you don't get is spectacle. The suspense that is built up so intensely before the Trinity test, is let out somewhat underwhelmingly when the bomb is finally dropped. It's a big explosion that sort of looks like a nuke. My jaw remained right where it was. This movie is playing on IMAX screens, and I did see it on a large-format, but there is no real advantage to that presentation.We're so starved for serious adult movies in the 2020s Hollywood landscape that even a less-than-triumphant attempt is a treasure that must be supported. I could sit here and tell you that Oppenheimer is a really ""talky"" movie, and one that doesn't quite teach us about some of the truly fascinating scientific aspects of the atomic bomb (I was never sure of exactly how Oppenheimer's previous work translated to the Manhattan Project, or why splitting the atom was such an important stepping stone), but there is no way I'm not going to urge people to see this film. Here is the good stuff we film buffs talk about. They don't make idea-driven mega-blockbusters about real people in the real world, but every so often one slips through. See it and savor the high.85/100."
"The movie is long at the 3 hours, but it doesn't seem that way. Cillian Murphy looks very much like Oppenheimer in this. Did you know that he ate only one almond and water for weeks to lose the weight? I worry about actors who do stuff like that - many doctors think it is dangerous. His performance is excellent, I am sure that an Oscar nomination will be forthcoming. But the highlight for me in acting was Robert Downey, Jr. As Lewis Strauss, the former head of the Atomic Energy Commision who developed a deep hatred for Oppenheimer on a perceived slight at a hearing. And he was suspicious of Oppenheimer communist ties - he teamed up with Edward Teller, who was angry with Oppenheimer because of Oppenheimer's opposition to the H-bomb to wreck Oppenheimer's professional life. At least so far this year, I think Downey is a shoo-in for a best supporting actor Oscar. The movie is filled with many other fine actors, including Rami Malek (""Mr. Robot"") who has a relatively small but key role in the hearings on Strauss. Emily Blunt is very good as Oppenheimer's wife but the highlight from the female acting performance for me is Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock. My only casting complaint is Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves; Groves was a beefy, gruff man, I don't think Damon fills that bill - the late, great Brian Dennehy would have been perfect. Surely there is a similar actor out there. The movie is filled with half of Hollywood it seems, including Alden Ehrenreich, Dane DeHaan, and Josh Hartnett. It is the must-see movie of the year or even the decade!"
"9/10. Christopher Nolan proves once again that he is one of the most prolific filmmakers of our time. This biographical drama is brilliantly crafted, epic in scope, and has powerful storytelling anchored with a very well-rounded cast. The way he crafts this film on a terrifying subject is beautiful and intense.The sound design is hard hitting and awesomely loud. Yes, you can hear most of dialogue and doesn't get drowned out like it did in ""Tenet"". Ludwig Goransson creates a haunting soundtrack to help the film feel alive and horrifying.Cillian Murphy is mesmerizing in his powerhouse performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer. His acting is very expressive with his facial expressions and mannerisms. Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, and especially Robert Downey Jr. Are all standouts as well. Hoyte van Hoytema cinematography is a wonderful sight to behold. They shot this with Imax cameras on real film as opposed to the overused digital format. Nolan wants you to experience this in the theater the way it's meant to be. Kodak also invented the first ever black and white Imax film for this movie.It's not a completely perfect film. It does run for about three hours long, but it's well earned. It's a slow burn, densely filled drama that will turn off some of the mainstream movie goers. Some of the other big-name stars have a limited amount of screentime. Hopefully, this will be one of the front runners for the Oscars. Nolan painted a wonderful picture about the birth of nuclear warfare, atomic bombs, fear, death, and the possibility of destroying the earth.So now it's time to give Nolan his long, overdue Oscar for directing. How he wasn't even nominated for ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Inception"" is baffling."
"A solid film by Nolan but it is worth mentioning to some that if you're expecting action you will be tremendously disappointed. This is a biography of Oppenheimer that focuses on key moments of his life. What drove this movie for me was the top notch quality of acting and the sound/compositions which were instrumental in bringing out the drama within a lot of the dialogue and the acting chops throughout the movie. Please be warned that the overwhelming majority of this movie is dialogue.While both Interstellar and Inception were extremely deep films from Nolan(and in my opinion his best work), there was a popcorn quality about those films where you could loosen up and not take the experience too seriously and still find it entertaining. With Oppenheimer you better pay close attention to the dialogue and what's going on because you will be lost. With that being said it is rewarding getting a glimpse of the drama surrounding the development of nuclear weapons, some of the darkest times in human history. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer will be his defining role of a lifetime. The acting from the cast was flawless along with the brilliant sound editing. I expect this film will be force to be reckoned with at the Oscars."
"So in the electronic / synth music world, its a sin to criticise anything the Mode do.I definitely feel the same can be said about Nolans films. He has made some great films, The Prestige, Interstellar & Memento. But on the other hand, has has made some stinkers, Tennent was appallingly stupid.This looks absolutely beautiful, the cinematography is sensational. The performances are very good, Murphy plays the lead perfectly and Emily Blunt plays a brilliant drunk. However there are some terrible accents, is Kenneth Branagh meant to be South African?Problem with this movie is, it's very confusing, its also very, very boring, it doesn't pack any kind of emotion, we are talking about the most shameful moment in history, yet, somehow it clearly manages to avoid any of that.Very boring."
"Oppenheimer, directed by Christopher Nolan, is a gripping and morally complex film that explores the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientist behind the atomic bomb. Nolan expertly weaves together a multi-layered narrative, using a blend of color and black-and-white scenes, to depict Oppenheimer's personal and professional milestones, including his involvement in the Manhattan Project. While the film delves deep into the bomb building process, it refrains from showing the actual bombings. Instead, it focuses on the lingering consequences and ethical implications of nuclear weaponry. The movie's brilliance lies in its ability to put Oppenheimer's story into a larger context. It showcases the intersection of science, politics, and personal struggles during an age of transformational scientific discovery.As the film progresses, Nolan masterfully navigates through Oppenheimer's life, revealing his complex character and the numerous relationships that shaped him. Oppenheimer, portrayed with fervent intensity by Cillian Murphy, is depicted as a polymath, an enigmatic man of contradictions, a womanizer, and a visionary scientist. He grapples with the immense moral implications of his work.The film's narrative structure is intricate and nonlinear, reflecting Oppenheimer's complexity and the era he lived in. Nolan uses his signature cinematic style, utilizing 65-millimeter film to create a sense of grandeur and monumentality that befits the historical significance of the events portrayed.Throughout the film, Oppenheimer's relationships with key figures such as Niels Bohr and Lewis Strauss are explored-this provides insights into his ideological struggles and the political forces at play during World War II and the ensuing Cold War. The film delves into Oppenheimer's friendships, romances, and involvement with leftist causes. These causes would later come under scrutiny during the McCarthy era anti-Communist fervor.Nolan's decision not to show the actual bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was wise and deliberate. This emphasizes Oppenheimer's ethical and moral dilemmas and the world at large. Instead, the film focuses on the aftermath of the bombings, the devastating consequences, and the arms race that followed. This creates a palpable sense of dread and reflection on nuclear weapons' destructive power.Nolan maintains the fast pace and fragmented narrative as he paints this abstract portrayal, weaving across continents and introducing a myriad of excellently cast characters, including physicist Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) who had a role in the Manhattan Project. The film is packed with familiar faces like Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., and Gary Oldman. However, all of the spectacular casting may distract you from their characters and prevent immersion. Benny Safdie as Edward Teller, the hydrogen bomb inventor, fits perfectly. Rami Malek's talent felt wasted on a minor role, but it adds another recognizable name to the cast.As Oppenheimer nears its conclusion, the pace slows down and the black-and-white sequences become more prominent, emphasizing the trials and tribulations Oppenheimer faced during the McCarthy era, where his reputation and career were scrutinized due to his past communist associations. These sections culminate in a powerful synthesis of Oppenheimer's struggles and contributions. They showcase a man who both played a vital role in scientific progress and grappled with moral implications.In the end, Nolan's film leaves a profound impact, reminding the audience of humanity's fragility and the responsibility that comes with wielding immense power. Nolan skillfully weaves a complex narrative of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life, exploring his multi-faceted character and his pivotal role in the development of the atomic bomb, all while warning of the devastating consequences of unchecked scientific progress, resulting in an intellectually thrilling and morally compelling film."
"The reason this is only a 9 is simply because I have only watched it once. I have given 19 films a 10/10, including 3 Nolan films (Inception, The Dark Knight, and The Prestige.) I will probably end up changing this to a 10/10, but want to watch it one more time before I do bc I take a 10/10 rating very serious. Now lets get into the movie:It's another Christopher Nolan masterpiece. The acting, editing, cinematography, score, all engulfs you into the theater for an amazing experience. This should be the front runner for every Oscar. Especially Cillian Murphy as best leading. Anyone that has watched Peaky Blinders knows what he is capable of as an actor, well he got his chance to lead a blockbuster movie and he nailed it. The last act kind of drags on, to be fair it is a 3 hour movie, but the first 2 hours of the movie is absolute peak filmmaking. The pace combined with the score make for as good an experience you can have in a movie theater. My buddy and I couldnt go 10 minutes without tapping or looking at eachother in disbelief. I can rant about this film all day, but if I can get anything across it is that it lived up to the hype and then some. Everyone needs to see it, and see it in theaters. It is too big and loud to watch at home. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did."
"Oppenheimer, the 2023 cinematic masterpiece, is an intellectually stimulating tour de force that delves deep into the historical, moral, and psychological complexities of one of the most influential figures of the twentieth century, J. Robert Oppenheimer. Directed by visionary filmmaker, this biographical drama immerses the audience in the intricate world of science, ethics, and the human condition.Through breathtaking cinematography, meticulously crafted storytelling, and superb performances, Oppenheimer transports viewers to the era of World War II with unparalleled authenticity. The narrative unfolds elegantly, capturing the essence of Oppenheimer's pivotal role in the Manhattan Project and his subsequent grappling with the ethical implications of creating the atomic bomb. The film's chronological exploration of his life strikes a balance between historical accuracy and profound introspection, leaving a lasting impact on its audience.One of Oppenheimer's greatest strengths lies in its intelligent portrayal of complex characters. The film offers a deep understanding of Oppenheimer himself, capturing his brilliance and intellectual curiosity, while successfully conveying the emotional turmoil he faced as he encountered the catastrophic consequences of his scientific creation. This multidimensional characterization humanizes Oppenheimer, allowing viewers to empathize with his moral dilemmas and inner conflicts.Furthermore, Oppenheimer presents an astute commentary on the ethical responsibility of scientists within the larger context of warfare. It does not shy away from exploring the profound ethical dilemmas faced by Oppenheimer and his colleagues, forcing the audience to confront the moral implications of their actions.

Each frame is meticulously composed, capturing the atmosphere of the time and transporting the audience to the war-torn era. The evocative score heightens the emotional intensity of each scene, expertly complementing the narrative and enhancing the viewer's engagement.Oppenheimer's thought-provoking narrative prompts a deeper reflection on the moral responsibilities of individuals within society, the nature of scientific progress, and the unintended consequences of human innovation. It encourages us to confront the tragic dichotomy between scientific achievements and their potential for destruction, urging viewers to contemplate the importance of ethical decision-making in the face of monumental challenges.In conclusion, Oppenheimer is an intellectually stimulating and emotionally moving film that transcends traditional biographical dramas. Stellar performances, masterful storytelling, and profound insights into the complexities of an exceptional mind make it an absolute must-watch. This cinematic masterpiece reaffirms the power of film as a medium to inspire intellectual discourse and introspection. Oppenheimer truly stands as a cinematic marvel deserving of its place in the annals of cinema."
"Very Good historical movie.Timeline jumps were very often confusing and I lost track of what was happening at what time exactly. Coming to an end, it started to do more sense and i grasped the idea of it. However it was quite thrilling and even though it was heavy Dialog and Monolog packed, I've been very emmersed most of the movie.These kind of movies are in my opinion very interesting, since they highlight the lives of one pf the most important people that were part of building the world as we live in it today. Honestly speaking, if I have not watched this movie, I wouldn't know a lot about Dr. Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, and probably never would look hin up."
"Oppenheimer was a horror drama that shows you how a humankind can destroy the world without thinking of its own kind.It was typical Nolan movie with brilliant cinematography, appealing visuals and BG score.Cillian was outstanding but Robert Downey Jr. Man He was extremely good, probably one of his finest work, loved his acting. Matt Damon also did a good job.It's not just about the invention of a destructive tool but also connect to the human nature how the man himself feels when he realizes what he's done.Nolan was imaginative, clever and at his best, he created a beautiful cinematic MASTERPIECE."
"In the movie, Oppenheimer is a professor in Leiden, The Netherlands. You can hear him speak 'Dutch' for a class of students, but everyone in our Dutch movie theatre mumbled 'what? What's he saying?' It was a fantasy language, and certainly not Dutch, not even German. I think making a movie about real events requires proper investigation and love for details. Therefore we thought it was irritating that the actor and director didn't check this scene with Dutchies. The movie was very long and there were lots of characters and names you had to remember, but the general warning and impact of human destruction power and balances of power was very clear and very frightening. The uncertainty whether the bomb would destroy the complete atmosphere, and that they took that risk: man, one day we will really destroy earth, one way or the other."
"This film is magnificent. In the hands of a lesser director I think this would have been average and a bit of a snorefest -potentially. Nolan never lets this happen with astounding score, crackling dialogue , flawless acting and the typical Nolan direction. There is never a dull moment. Also there's a real element of suspense/ tension that Nolan exudes which makes this biopic feel more like a suspenseful drama but never swaying away from documenting the self titled life story. If the film had ended at the bombing I think I would have given this one less star but the last 40 minutes post bombing is riveting cinema and elevates it to almost greatness. Is this Nolan's best film? Not for me but is never the less a fantastic achievement."
"Well, I'm not sure why everyone is criticising the movie when it's actually quite good.Few people are comparing this movie to Barbie because of their release dates being so close together. It should be emphasised that both are not comparable.The actor Cillian Murphy portraying Oppenheimer in the film was superbly portrayed by Nolan. The visuals that he created without using VFX or CG demonstrate Nolan's commitment to the film. All of the actors had outstanding performances, and the casting is excellent. The Subjective and Objective points of view of the characters were masterfully done in the screenplay. Everyone assumed that this was solely about the development of the atomic bomb, but in truth, Oppenheimer overcame his argument regarding his security clearance.Every segment of the audience should see this film."
"The movie takes a reasonably interesting look at Oppenheimers life and work. It uses the most part of its 3 hours runtime focusing around two periods of Oppenheimers life: the time in Los Alamos and the time around the hearing for the renewal of his security clearance. The latter one is the anchor from which the movie jumps around the other timeframes.While the movie gives an ok view of Oppenheimer on the outside, it never gets into his head. Instead, it keeps his thoughts and motives a mystery. This is done by design, it's not an oversight. For me, this is the film's greatest flaw. The events and people around Oppenheimer are known and can be read and watched from many sources. His inner workings are never part of that, so an examination, even if it was a kind of best approximation, would be something new.However, it is not the films only flaw. It feels jumpy in it's movement between the timelines, and the methods to keep them apart for the viewer seem somewhat crude. Then there is the director's play with sound volume that really got on my nerves. Nolan started this around Interstellar and Dunkirk and adopted it as a signature style element of his. For me, it's an attack on the ears and way too loud in a good theater.Then there is the smaller stuff. Oppenheimer's surroundings and times were filled with great minds, some of which appear for longer or shorter screentime. Sadly, all of the stay cardboard cutouts with no depth at all. The deserved more.So yeah, the movie's a bit meh. It's not a bad movie, all considered, but it's also far from good. And maybe a movie is not the right format for the subject. There was just too much going on in that time and too many people of importance involved in the events. I think a limited series, maybe 6 parts of an hour or so would have been a better idea.Watch it anyway. It's too important not to."
"Well firstly not a typical Nolan film. More of a biopic drama documentary that definitely does not need to be seen on Imax. It also does not need to be 3 hours long, wow it really drags.I get the subject matter is profound but the direction and delivery of this movie was so convoluted and dry that I feel they had to throw in the porn scenes just for some added excitement. Anyone who says they needed those scenes to make it realistic should also believe they needed to see Oppenheimer defecating too as that is also something people do.What also was confusing was how irrelevant Einstein's role in this movie was that he almost didn't need to be there?Also the whole movie they are talking about the hydrogen bomb and the potential of it causing a chain reaction but ultimately made an atomic bomb?The fact there are way too many characters in this movie make it even more hard to follow and the whole Strauss fiasco at the end was very predictable.I would say save your money and watch this on your TV. Definitely not IMAX or 70mm worthy."
"This movie is a modern cinema masterpiece of and a surprisingly very accurate biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer. The film tracks his life and most impactful/relevant events to his rise as an ambassador of quantum mechanics, great scientist, and his capabilities as a leader and speaker while depicting his inner conflict, his bouts of delusion and arrogance.As you may expect, the film will focus on the Manhattan Project and everything that takes place afterwards but it is ultimately first about the man, and second about the bomb.As expected from a Nolan film, Beautiful camera work, incredible special effects without any CGI(purely practical), incredible writing but also a VERY impressive pace for long film. Not a single time did I take a look at the time or felt bored, I was enamored throughout all 3 hours of runtime(try to use the restroom before you watch it in the cinemas). While not 100% accurate, what it does for historical accuracy is truly great as it is very close. The acting was also absolutely masterful from everyone in the cast. Cillian Murphy fulfilled his duty of carrying this film and did an incredible job at it. Truly showing his greatness as an actor. The rest of the cast was very talented and some pleasant casting surprises may make you smile as you see them perform some incredible roles, big or small.I highly recommend this film, a modern masterpiece that pushes the boundaries of film-making. 10/10."
"I was really taken by it. It is 3 hrs long but time flies fast when you watch it. Interesting, complelling and not too hard to follow but yeah you have to concentrate with all the dfferent names on scientists etc... A very strong biopic. Great actors. Gary Oldman, Robert Downey Jr and Matt Damon and many more. I would say Robert Downey Jr is the big star in this movie, but of course Cilian Murphy is magnetic too. I usually go for more relationship-oriented movies with strong psychological portaits so I was a little bit hesitant about this one. Action, Nolan.... not my cup of tea... I had my prejudies! But it's one cinematic experience and it is worth all the hype, unlike the Barbie movie."
"Christopher Nolan tackles one of the most divisive scientific achievements in human history--the invention of the atomic bomb--through the lens of it's chief creator, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and the resulting fallout this achievement had on Oppenheimer himself.A devastating and unflinchingly clear movie, it weaves through time with two main points of view, filmed alternatively in beautifully rendered colour and in a starkly entrancing black and white. This movie must be seen in a movie theatre, it practically demands it, with sweeping shots and visual effects of the absolute highest calibre. There is no question that what you are seeing is practically reality, the complexity and beauty of the visuals giving the sense that you are seeing things exactly as Oppenheimer saw them. It is a stunning achievement of direction, to make a movie so in-tune with its main character that every single emotion can be felt through the screen, and much of that can be attributed to the capability of Cillian Murphy, the undoubted star of this movie, whose piercing eyes and extreme subtlety lend to him a quiet fragility amongst total and utter conviction, unpicking a man of contradictions in a manner which reveals the depth of feeling and conflict that Oppenheimer battled throughout his life. He is not an easy character to like, and that is the point. He is a flawed genius, as they all are, a man with ego, with compassion, with the mental strength to coordinate a titanic effort to change the world, and whose emotions can be overwhelmed in a single phone call.A triumph of perspective, it is a character study which leaps through time and space in a way which would unbalance most biopics. Under Nolan's careful hand, every sequence informs another, slowly unfurling, slowly building tension which reaches not one, not two, but three spectacular peaks of release.Between these peaks, however, are the troughs, necessary exposition and quieter moments given to the movie, where it almost feels like the train is running to a stop, only for it to pick up and roar you straight into the heart of the next great scene. These troughs are where the movie wallows a little too much osce-wise, where it gets lost in the details and becomes a little muddled.Its other great failure is the scarcity of character given in particular to Kitty, Oppenheimer's wife, and his two children. Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh give more dimension to characters who, through no fault of their own, are forced onto the sidelines through the sheer scope of Nolan's narrative, but whose involvement is still vital to the emotional core of the movie. Robert Downey Jr takes the other big role of Lewis Strauss, a government official who recruits Oppenheimer to a government board on Atomic Energy after the war. He gives Strauss the necessary charisma, the necessary intensity to push back against Murphy's total control of the screen.Ludwig Goransson's score is exceptional, motifs appearing perfectly in sync with a superb sound design, lending so much extra intensity and detail to so many sequences in this movie. The sound design is simply perfection, adding to the narrative and to the character of Oppenheimer as well. Jennifer Lame's editing is so so brilliant, especially in the sequences where tension is high. Clean, efficient, technically masterful editing which turns scenes into with hammer blows.Lastly, Tom Conti's brief appearances as the famed physicist Albert Einstein provide the perfect pivot moments of the movie, putting down a definitive stamp of almost prophetic authority on a fittingly complex, nuanced, and chillingly beautiful portrait of the man who helped change the reality of the world as we know it."
"The only thing that kept me from giving this film a 9 instead of an 8 is the length. Not much shorter than the actual war. The directing was excellant and the cast is superb. The only one I had a small problem with was the choice for President Truman. I think in real life Truman was gruffer. Other than that, everyone was right on. I believe the story line was fairly accurate as was the locations. I strongly recommend seeing this film, if you can sit for 3 hours. So, pack a lunch, put your feet up and enjoy. I think you will not feel cheated and certainly not happy and upbeat but very informed."
"The true story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the renowned physicist who during World War II was appointed by Gen. Leslie Groves to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer spent years developing the atomic bomb, with his team of scientists. Their work led ultimately to success after they finally witness the first nuclear explosion in world history. However, when it is ultimately used against the Japanese, which brings about the end of the war. Oppenheimer is forced to face the current and future moral implications that would lead to the arms race.It's safe to say that the anticipation surrounding Oppenheimer has been palabale. The historical biopic by Christopher Nolan. The groundbreaking writer, director, and producer who reinvented the Batman comic book mythology with his Dark Knight trilogy. Not forgetting a further back catalog of ambitious work which has included Memento, Inception, Interstellar, and more aptly Dunkirk. Apt in that it shares the same period of World History as this his latest offering. Both a character study, as well as a depiction of the events leading to what would, and continues to be one of the most morally divisive and contentious moments in World History. The dropping of the atomic bomb on the Japanese cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Moments that in due course, led to the surrender of Japan. A hotly debated issue seeing as Germany had already surrendered, and it was believed by some that the Japanese would soon follow. Although with the war against the Japanese still being fought, American casualties were continuing to rise.Seemingly, Nolan makes no secret where his opinion lies on the subject. Taking opposition with then president, Harry H. Truman who finally gave the go-ahead. To this end, and using Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwitnthe's biography American Prometheus, as the film's template. The director sets about getting into the mind of Oppenheimer while chronicling, his work, and the political fallout of the man expressing his political views in the wake of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. To this end, the film juggles several time frames, one being the early academic life of the young future physicist, and his recruitment by Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) to head the Manhattan Project, which would lead to the Trinity Test. The 1954 Atomic Energy Committee Security Personnel hearings where Oppenheimer was accused of disloyalty, and having communist sympathies. And finally, the Senate hearings which were carried out to confirm the testimony of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) and the opposition from other scientists who thought Oppenheimer had been treated poorly.Initially, an anxious, conscious young man in his early years of academia. The future physicist would eventually develop into a more confident, charismatic, and charming figure. In this respect, Cillian Murphy proves to be an inspired casting choice who adroitly conveys the integrity and conviction of him. Seamlessly bridging the transition from his more youthful personae. Although one might have perceived him to be slightly lofty in nature, it's here as well that we see his shortcomings which are authentically realized. For all of his intelligence, one might have accused him of being naive. In so much as his communist associations in his own social circles. Something that comes back to dog him later in his professional life. He is indeed portrayed as a complex man and one who allowed himself to enter into an undertaking that would lead to ramifications of equitable complexity. His beliefs shifted into what was paradoxical in nature, which were exploited by those who politically opposed him. And Nolan's depiction of this is executed with sharp dramatic precision in his first hearings. Oppenheimer's personal life wasn't a bed of roses either, having a dalliance with his former lover, Jean Tatlock (Florance Pugh) whilst being married to his long-suffering wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt) and the dirty linen of which was made openly known. Ostensibly though she remained with her husband, even when he would bare the mantle of a martyr when being interrogated. Attempting to retain some shred of composed dignity much to her frustration and anguish. Hero or villain, whatever you make of him he at least was not one stay silent. Murphy flawlessly portrays a man who was never one to cower in fear of the inevitable backlash. Even in the face of the potential price it might have cost him domestically.Nolan is not one as well to shy away from adding some stylistic touches, which are complemented by Hoyte Van Hoytema's striking cinematography. Most notably as the Manhattan Project began to come to a close, and the testing of the H-bomb was fully tested. A moment captured mostly in a deafening, ethereal silence and visual splendor that contradicts the explosive devastation and fury of what has been unleashed. Finally climaxing with an ominous, thunderous explosion of sound. It's practically deiform, in its ferocity.Supported by a consummate ensemble cast that includes, Matthew Modine, Rami Malek Josh Hartnett, and Kenneth Branagh all giving stirring back-up. It's Robert Downey Jr. Who stands among the crowd, delivering what should be deserving of Oscar recognition. Oppenheimer is the story of a man, consumed with ideological persuasions, that are also countered by reservations, about how they should be implemented and punished for them by those who became ethically opposed to him. If there is a niggle it is that at times due to Nolan's use of sound mix feels mooted and echoey, making dialogue difficult to discern. Otherwise, Oppenheimer makes for a superb three hour watch, which while asking for your attention so that you may fully appreciate and understand the historical relevance. It's an ask that will pay off with great dividends."
"Oppenheimer.The story of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer and his role in the development of the atomic bomb.Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a biography about one of the most important characters in the modern history J. Robert Oppenheimer, it's more like a situation study and not a character study we see Oppenheimer's through what he does and what does happen to him with a little bit of his psychological life either.The character was a very complicated one, what can be more complicated than being a scientist in a war era and when your country is relying on you to make a weapon, to win a war.This matter got me thinking the whole movie, the morality of it and how Oppenheimer can be seen today, as a national hero for the Americans and one of the greatest scientist ever or just a selfish person, a careless one.The plot was very interesting obviously and I was fully focused on everything but somehow there were so many characters and scientists that I couldn't follow up, besides the 3 hours was filled with dialogs more than anything else and I can say they were some of the best I've ever seen, one of Nolan's best undoubtedly.Talking about the man himself, Nolan did some great achievement here in filmmaking, he's been competing himself until he brought us a CGI free movie about a nuclear bomb, you imagine!The practical visual effects were magnificent, especially the transitions at the first hour of the movie, I loved what they did there.Besides, one of the most thrilling build-ups is when they were launching a bomb to test it for the first time, it was perfect with the unexpected silent/loud thing and everything, however the scale of the explosion was disappointing a bit.Finally, I should mention that Cillian Murphy did the performance of his career, a one to remember far away from everything he ever did, Cillian as Oppenheimer was very powerful and he needs a reward as much as Robert Downey jr deserves it too, this duo carried the movie without a doubt .I can't forget Emily Blunt that deserves a nomination at least, I'd love that and everyone else from Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh to Rami Malek with his unbelievable scene, the cast was truly iconic .A very rewarding 3 hours, can't wait to see it again .Oups, I forgot to mention the soundtracks! Absolutely beautiful ."
"10/10. Gripping, suspenseful and surprisingly intimate. Great casting, even better performances, superb dialogue, and fantastic story telling. Cilian Murphy, Robert Downey, and even Gary Oldman (as short as his time was in the film) deserve Oscar nominations at the very least. Emily blunt was also amazing. This is Nolan's best work and it's not even close. Every scene had meaning, no useless scenes or useless dialogue. A lot of people seem to forget it's not just about the Manhattan project, it's about OPPENHEIMER.Most of the bad reviews are from people who think the dark knight trilogy is Nolan's best work."
"Thinking person's Cold War film, really. Dialogue heavy, so you have to pay attention or you may miss something. The non-linear narrative may not work for everyone, but we all know this is how Nolan makes his films. Therefore, we need to be ready for it. The acting was top notch, although Emily Blunt deserved more screen time. Same for Florence Pugh, really. So, there's a lot of mansplaining in this film, so to speak. Maybe that's a reflection of the subject matter's eras, but in a modern world, it is very noticeable. It doesn't detract from the quality of the film, but perhaps it makes us think that the film could have been a lot better if done differently. Either way, highly recommend this film for informative, intellectual, and thought-provoking ideas about humanity and science. Probably a lot of lessons in here about AI, too, using the idea expressed in Jurassic Park: The scientists were so concerned with whether they could, they didn't think about whether they should."
I'm a huge Nolan fan and went into the cinema expecting yet another 9/10 experience. I was disappointed.In my opinion the form doesn't fit the story. It's too infomation-dense to be a movie. It should've been a 5-episode mini series like Chernobyl or a semi-documentury feature on Discovery Channel. I found myself overwhelmed by all the dialogue and the constant switching of time lines.I also thought it was too pretentious. Almost every scene feels like a build up towards something important. The music is constantly rushing you like you have to prepare for something to happen. But nothing happens. Even the moment where the bomb is tested for the first time is an anti-climax.The acting is supercious and there are no oscar worthy performances. Cillian Murphy doesn't have the skills to portray a vast array of emotions. He only has two or three expressions.I give it a 7 for the production quality and the effort that has been put into it. But a 7 is too high for the experience I had.Don't go to the cinema. Wait for it to come out on a streaming service so you can pause to catch a breath and watch it like a mini-series. The form the story was supposed to have.
"The character of J Robert Oppenheimer wasn't only a bit of an SOB, but also very one dimensional and boring.The first hour was at a breakneck pace but disconnected. The 2nd hour was better, but after the (frankly quite a let down) A-Bomb test, the last hour was interminable.This movie has done something I thought impossible, it made me really dislike Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt. Quite an achievement.Stunt casting everywhere.The worst thing of all might be the music which was both awful AND deafening. The music competes with schizophrenic editing to bewilder and numb the viewer. Editing like JFK only works if your editor and director are at the top of their game and if there's a point to all the cuts.I honestly could never envision putting myself through the torture of watching this movie again.Between this and Dunkirk, oh my this Nolan fella is indeed fallible."
"Traces the story of Robert Oppenheimer from so-so college student through to his fascination with quantum mechanics and the setting up of The Manhattan Project and the development of the atomic bomb. This is all against a womanising background, his somewhat dangerous dabblings with politics and the American government's obsession with communism and the determination to pin that on Oppenheimer and relieve him of all authority after the war.Fascinating how Christopher Nolan, who clearly knows his stuff, has written and directed such an extremely detailed analysis of Oppenheimer and his flawed character and never once treats us as anything less than reasonably intelligent - quite a novelty. You are never bored going through the man's history because Nolan's script is so sharp, the whole thing is gorgeous to look it, the soundtrack impressive but mostly because the actors - Murphy, Downey Jr, Blunt, Damon and briefly Pugh are just flat out fabulous in their roles - surely must feature in next year's Oscar's. This is not light storytelling, you do have to concentrate to benefit, but ultimately it is a very impressive piece of mainstream cinema, sadly, rarely seen much these days."
"The film is interesting from a political point of view, showing the influences of power. However, too much time is spent on that, and not enough on what would make sense to an audience unfamiliar with the story. As a result, many elements are skipped over. First, it lacks empathy for its main character, who seems lost in the middle of a cause that is beyond him, even though he has succeeded in carrying out a project of considerable scope, and, above all, ignores the consequences of the invention, both for the inhabitants of the research site and in Japan, and Oppenheimer's stance on arms control. A great pity."
"Even though I'm not all that attached to the story, the way the film portrays the complex emotions of the ""Father of the Atomic Bomb"" is fascinating. It gives audiences like us the freedom to interpret the identity of Oppy through the perspectives of him and the people around his life. Even though the film is mainly told from the Destroyer of Worlds's point of view, one can't help but think accordingly: in fact, What kind of person does he see himself as?This is the most different Nolan's flavor. Heavy politics, lots of dialogue, and a little bit of time-shifting narrative. It's a pity that I didn't have a chance to watch it in IMAX. Apart from the visuals, the sound in the normal theater is also not satisfying enough for me.I'm not that much into it, but still, this is one of the finest films of the year."
"The whole movie I was wondering how it couldn't possibly have any CGI in it.Seeing the Trinity test in theaters was the best choice, it's too beautiful, surprising and with a lot of tension. It made me think how terrifying a third world war with those kinds of weapons would be.I loved Cilian Murphy's performance, I could feel the problems happening in his mind, but making clear Nolan's excellent direction.There were many dialogue scenes, but then they put many more dialogue scenes with an exquisite soundtrack and performances that caused my eyes to open even more.Unbelievably I was left wanting more, I want to see more!!!!"
"Oppenheimer is a wonderful, immaculate film-a beautifully crafted, powerful story chronicling the human impact of its historical events. It's full of character and tension.The only thing keeping it from a 10/10 is that Josh Peck, our beloved god-king, only had 4 lines of dialogue in the film.If they had given him a larger role, expanded his character's backstory, perhaps given him a sex scene, and allowed our master to showcase his unmatched talent and glory, then perhaps Nolan's latest film could have reached its coveted masterpiece status.But, as it stands, it's a pretty great film with not enough Josh Peck."
I will definitely going to watch it again on IMAX when I get the chance as this is some high quality story telling. The movie is worth the hype created before the release.Cillian Murphy did an exceptional job and no one will gonna surprise if he gets the Oscar for it.Robert Downey also steals the show whenever he got a chance to do his job. Emily and Florence did their part however small it was but impact will remain.The music shines in this movie in every frame. You will definitely feel the music going through your veins with the scene and that's brilliance of Nolan and his team. This is a 💎 gem.
"It's crazy how one of the most anticipated summer blockbuster films of this year is based on a historic figure...and it's directed by Christopher Nolan. I think this is the movie people been wanting for a while. Something not action-pack, not computer generated, not fun or silly quips, but something new or refreshing that us audiences haven't seen in a long time. Even with Nolan's style of filmmaking, this movie feels different from the rest of his work. It's basically a 3-hour movie about J. Robert Oppenheimer rises and fall of his fame as becoming the ""father of the atomic bomb."" It's mostly people talking throughout the movie, but the main focus is Oppenheimer which is more of a character study in his point of view and Lewis Strauss. The cast was fantastic, it was visually stunning, the music score is very tense like you were a part of that certain scene, the story was great as usual from Christoper Nolan. Sometimes the sound mixing can be loud between dialogues, but I can easily make it out what characters are saying. In the end, the movie will leave you in fear for what the future of a nuclear weapons will be and the consequences."
"One of the best movies I've ever seen in my entire life.This is the first time Christopher Nolan produces a movie different from the rest, this time a realistic story (Oppenheimer) father of the atomic bomb.The movie will make you feel the importance of science and how science can shape the world.This pulsating thriller, takes a deep dive into the depths of power and what that power can do to a person. There are moments that just left me so emotionally shook because of the sheer scope that was fully explored of the actions of these people involved in creating this.Cillian Murphy was unbelievable as oppenheimer he will be nominated best actor this year and I'm confident he'll win the Oscar, I like him so much one of the greatest actors in the history."
"There's always 3 sides to a story. In this case it will be, Oppenheimer's, then there is Christopher Nolan's version (based on the biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin) and the truth. We hope and pray that what's shown is as close to the real story; magnified for cinema, but true to the events that happened.Having said that, this is a brilliantly-made film and Christopher Nolan gets better and better with every new movie. Unlike the usual conventional biopics, he creates a wonderful layered examination of a man via all his great accomplishments and fundamental flaws.Through a judicial committee interrogation, Oppenheimer is haunted by errors of his judgement, shown through flashbacks of pivotal moments in his life. We get a perspective of what his mind would've been processing through this harrowing period of his life where all his hard work could get mitigated by powerful government officials. Nolan manages to work his magic in the best possible way, striking a balance between showcasing the triumphant rise and tragic fall of an imperfect man.The film presents Oppenheimer as neither a hero nor a villain, but a complicated man whose human qualities undermine what he will be remembered for. He can be viewed as a martyr and a scapegoat simultaneously, for the manner in which he managed to end the deadliest conflict in world history, while ushering in something even worse.A career best performance from the consistently brilliant Cilian Murphy. He gives his all to the role of Robert J. Oppenheimer. And Robert Downey Jr shows that he hasn't forgotten acting post his 10 years' stint as Iron Man. This is one of his best roles. The rest of the cast, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Rami Malek, add significantly to the film's talent pool.Having expressed his dislike about the use of Computer Generated Imagery, Nolan keeps viewers on their toes through good directorial proficiency. The creative use of editing keeps the story moving at a brisk pace, especially considering the movie's 3 hour run-time. The cinematography and soundtrack (mostly soundscapes) further create an unmatched cinematic experience."
"Well, Oppy is quite an experience. In many ways it's an amazing film, BUT... it's stubbornly nonlinear, as if someone shuffled the storyboards. And somewhat impressionistic. I think Nolan was trying to capture in visuals both the psychological noise of that super-secret project and the zeitgeist of that pressure-packed era - without abandoning the narrative. At 3 hours in length, it's probably not everyone's cup of tea - I realized halfway through I wished we had gone to a theatre with reclining chairs. It really helps if you know the arc of Oppenheimer's story, or at least the moral ambiguity that tempered the scientific deadline to develop a device that ""could"" end life on earth.Caveat: if you're taking your dad, and he just got a pacemaker, bring ear plugs for him. Nolan and his sound designer play audio pranks throughout the film, following a quiet or silent passage with sudden deafening sound."
"Christopher Nolan seems incapable of telling a simple story - and this is in effect a very, very simple story.His best films, Inception, Memento, use all kinds of time/dimension warping shenanigans to produce what are finally superb and engrossing movies.But give him a simple story, linear, regular-time-based - and he is completely lost.So here we have 3 hours of episodic, soap-opera style vignettes, one after another after another until it thankfully finishes.There is no forward momentum, no character development, just some good acting (as you would expect) and some OK cameos, Tom Conti as Einstein being the notable laugh out loud exception. (The cinema was full to capacity when I watched this film, and I have never heard so much sniggering.)
But in the end it's just dull! So so dull.C minus."
"What an fantastic movie. It was the most anticipated movie (after Christopher Nolan announcement) and Nolan has delivered the gem. His direction, camera shots and sound was perfect at each and every moment. Watched it 1st day 1st show. Top notch acting by everyone and you will get to know the story of what Sir Julius Robert Oppenheimer had gone throughout the years (right from the recruitment for the project). Though he believed in himself and his intuitions that he will win not today but someday. After so many years of dedication towards the cinema Cillian Murphy has given fantabulous performance and right judge for the role."
"This movie is like solid 8 but really not easy to understand. There are several layers like politics, moral, family, history, science and if you want to get the full experience you might need to be like 60-70 years old professor from US who has vivid interest in politics and is really open-minded. Seriously, I was prepared although not falling into this category but most of the audience I think did not understand a lot as they were too young and politically fragile. And that is not even touching the morals of the story or ancient history mentioned briefly. Or consequences for the Japanese that were so terrible. Go there, watch and come back to this movie in 10-15 years again if you are under 45."
"We always believe Nolan's films are always confusing and mind boggling but the recent Oppenheimer is Nolan's one of the best work.Atomic Bombing & The Dialogues are the main theme for me..The buildup in the first half clearly wins the shows in second.Cilian Murphy is exceptional as always but Robert Downey Jr clearly gave his career best.Marvellous casting just added flavours to this dish. The Dialogue Exchange throughout the film is the most Standout Part!!!Robert J Oppenheimer is still a Mystery for the people!This is what Cinema is all about &
Christopher Nolan is Master of it.Period!"
"I was very slightly cautious about this movie after Dunkirk disappointed, but Nolan once again proves that film an outlier in his quest to deliver masterpiece after masterpiece of cinema.""Oppenheimer"" does not disappoint the viewer at all. Cillian Murphy delivers his finest onscreen performance of his career, one that should undoubtedly draw multiple nominations and awards of the highest order. The same could be said of the entire tremendously put together ensemble cast.Forget the awards however, if they come they come. With or without them this film stands on its own as arguably the greatest film of the 2020's so far, and it very well might maintain that status.I didn't even see the film in IMAX (due to the horrible availability of the format) and the visual and sound were incredible, and I could feel the force it provided throughout the film in my seat as Nolan intended even in a regular cinema."
"Powerful. Sublime. All this adjectives used for this movie are absolutely right. The double plot in this movie works really well, and the cuts between scenes showed us perfectly what time it really was. The cinematography resonates with the weightiness of the subject, weaving a visual tapestry of awe. And, of course, let us not forget the exceptional brilliance of every actor and actress, each breathing life into their characters with sheer marvel. A masterpiece and a future classic for sure.Synopsis:
During World War II, Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. Appoints physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer and a team of scientists spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. Their work comes to fruition on July 16, 1945, as they witness the world's first nuclear explosion, forever changing the course of history."
"Saw this tonight at a premier party in Oak Ridge, TN of all places. Packed house. Sold out in all theatres. Gotta admit I wish I had gone to imax just for a few scenes, but really, most of the movie was really about political drama as opposed to the atomic bomb. I was really impressed with the acting and think Cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar. Nolan-maybe. Downey, probably no. I liked him and he did a great job, don't get me wrong, but I'll admit, until I realized the motivations of his character I didn't really understand his significance. Movie could have done a better job at pointing out what the political points were in the second half because I was little lost. I did think that the final third of the movie dragged a little but maybe that's because I was in about my 5th hour at the theatre, with the premier pre activities, and was pretty tired. I will say that, for me, the payoff was, after all the congressional hearings and back room interrogation, the last two minutes. It brought it all together for me. So, while I did love this movie, I can't quite give it past an 8 for some of the aspects that didn't just quite make it the experience I thought it was going to be."
"Be aware, I'm not tagging this review with spoilers, but I will discuss some of the real life history. If you believe that would count as a spoiler stop reading now.Okay, with that out of the way...Oppenheimer is a dense, talkie, mature, multilayered character study that does a lot right. This is probably Nolan's most mature film when it comes to politics and historical complexity, as it deals with the paradoxical realities of the era its set in and offers a truly three dimensional portrait of its main characters and especially Oppenheimer himself. There are some incredible performances here, including career best work from Cillian Murphy as the lead. The music score is fantastic, although it sometimes drowns out the dialogue, and the film is beautifully shot. I know some reviews have said this is an ""ugly"" film but I completely disagree. There are some truly awe-inspiring shots here and everything fits the story and the tone well. I saw this in regular 70mm and will see it again in IMAX 70mm in a few days. Some of the best shots are deceptively simple ones.In fact, I'd say the first 2/3rds of this movie are a genuine masterpiece. The pacing is exceptional. The editing reminded me a bit of some of Oliver Stone's 90s movies (like JFK or Natural Born Killers) or Scorsese's faster paced films, and it really helps to get you into the head of Oppenheimer himself. There are some shots where dialogue isn't properly synced, but I think this fit the headspace of the main character. In other words, Nolan was purposely breaking the rules. There's one scene that blatantly breaks the 180 rule and it's incredibly effective at disorienting the audience in the same way Oppenheimer himself is disoriented.So yes, I'd say this a 9/10 or even 10/10 movie right up to the actual Trinity test. And then the film kinda falls apart. Most importantly, the test itself is hugely underwhelming. This is a case where Nolan's insistence on doing everything practically is actually a net negative. The explosion never looks like an actual atom bomb. It's clearly just a big explosion they did for real in the desert, and while there is some wonderful sound design in this scene, it never captures the awe and terror that we need to feel. A little bit of CGI enhancement could have gone a long way. Even in the old days things weren't just done for real; you'd sometimes use composite effects or miniatures to create a desired effect bigger than anything you could capture entirely in camera.Regardless of what you think of the show, Twin Peaks had an episode that depicts the Trinity test in one long unbroken shot, and that single shot is far more effective than anything we see here at actually depicting the almost mystical terror of the atom bomb. If you took that scene and cut it into this movie, with snap cuts to the reaction shots, you'd have a much more powerful sequence. The film spends a long time building up to this and it's so underwhelming that it's hard to not be disappointed. I could tell the energy of the packed audience also changed after this scene, and people started to get a little antsy in their seats.Speaking of which: most of the last act is meandering, overly talkie, and stagnant. I don't know why the film decided to focus so much on a character other than Oppenheimer; that may have worked well in a miniseries, but for a feature all of that could have been condensed into a third of the time and instead we could have spent more time with Oppenheimer coming to terms with his feelings about what he did and his role in world history. This is when the breakneck cutting finally needed to slow down and let us breathe a bit, but if anything, it just speeds up, like it's trying to get through a billion things at once. The last act of the film kinda feels like homework.With that said, the very last five minutes are incredible, and gave me chills. It's probably my favorite ending sequence from any Nolan film.This is an ambitious and complex work, and it's worth seeing. It has some of Nolan's finest directing in it and you will be thinking about it after you leave the theater. But it can't quite stick the landing. Compare this to another biopic, Lawrence of Arabia (in my humble opinion probably the greatest biopic ever made). There's a great scene where a man yells out to Lawrence, ""WHO ARE YOU??"" and the shot lingers and holds on his face. It's an incredible moment of filmmaking and acting at their best. In Oppenheimer, this scene would have been half the length and intercut with three other scenes at the same time. In other words, the last act this film desperately needed to slow down and focus more on the psychology of its characters and less on the politics. It also would have been great to see some additional scenes following the end of WW2, such as the demon core accident which happened in August of 1945.With all of that said, this is still a GOOD movie, and anyone remotely interested in history or filmmaking should see it. For me, Nolan's best films are still The Prestige, Memento and Inception, but this may win him an Oscar."
"My mind was immediately blanked after the three-hour movie was done, but it wasn't confusion or any negative feelings that overwhelmed me. It was the ending scene that hit me hard, a simple yet profound conversation between two scientific greats, Albert Einstein and J. Robert Oppenheimer. Hours after the movie's conclusion, scenes flashed in my mind, and I tried to piece them together, yet I found myself grappling with an unanswered question: ""What exactly do I feel?"" The movie had left me with an indescribable sense of wonder. The following day, my thoughts remained fixated on the movie, prompting me to focus on myself instead of researching it further. In this introspection, I realized that ""Oppenheimer"" stands apart from any other movie I have experienced. It isn't driven by piquant conversations about morality or philosophy like ""12 Angry Men"" or ""Network."" Instead, it allows you to immerse yourself in the sentiments of a REAL HUMAN, whose mind is brimming with complications and contradictions. The movie's ending scene, which at first seemed simple, had become a profound catalyst for my reflections on the world.""Oppenheimer"" is an amazing cinematic experience, showcasing the brilliance of cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema. Through captivating visuals, the film skillfully conveys the full range of human emotions. Christopher Nolan's exceptional direction takes us on a remarkable journey, deftly delivering the story with finesse.The performances of all the actors, no matter how small their roles, are nothing short of exceptional. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer authentically captures the scientist's intellectual brilliance and inner conflicts. Emily Blunt, in her role as Kitty Oppenheimer, brings depth to her character, portraying a strong and supportive partner during the turbulent scientific pursuit.Particularly praiseworthy is Matt Damon's role as Leslie Groves, the general overseeing the Manhattan Project. Damon's performance exudes conviction and gravitas, adding a remarkable dimension to the movie.And now, a special mention for Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss in the movie. Renowned for his iconic portrayal of Tony Stark in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Downey Jr. Surprises with an exceptional performance as Strauss. He portrays a complex character with depth and conviction, showcasing his incredible talent as an actor.""Oppenheimer"" leaves a profound impact, transcending a simple historical retelling. The film delves into the intricacies of a brilliant scientist's mind, exploring the complexities and contradictions that often accompany intellectual greatness. It compels us to confront the moral dilemmas faced by those who contribute to groundbreaking scientific discoveries and the far-reaching consequences of their actions.The ending scene, featuring the poignant conversation between J. Robert Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein, resonates deeply, leaving us with a lingering contemplation of their choices and the immense responsibility that comes with knowledge.To truly appreciate ""Oppenheimer,"" avoid getting lost in the minutiae of the details. Instead, surrender yourself to its beautiful cinematography and allow the emotions the director intended to wash over you. The film presents a thought-provoking portrayal of the complexities of a human mind. As you watch, absorb the sentiment and contemplate the impact of a simple conversation between two brilliant scientists on the world's fate.""Oppenheimer"" is more than just a movie; it's a captivating experience that stays with you long after the credits roll. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction, coupled with the exceptional performances of the cast, makes ""Oppenheimer"" a must-watch film that transcends the boundaries of traditional cinema. This movie is a testament to the power of storytelling and its ability to challenge our perceptions, evoke genuine emotions, and provoke meaningful reflections on the course of human history.Additionally, I urge the audience not to overanalyze every detail, for doing so may overwhelm the senses. Instead, sit back, enjoy the beautiful cinematic journey, and immerse yourself in the emotions that the director has skillfully crafted. ""Oppenheimer"" offers a unique exploration of the human spirit and leaves us with an unanswerable question-a question that perhaps has no definitive answer. Yet, therein lies the beauty of this cinematic masterpiece."
"For a three hour film, it still proved not enough time to cover any part of his life with enough time to explore. Music all the way through the film which at times made me struggle to hear what was being said. Also felt that some scenes would have played better without music. Due to what felt like a rush to complete so many strands of his life, I never felt connected or to understand the man. A great cast but a film I would not watch again. I was never bored but it just did not have any emotional impact which surprised me. I am not a fan of nolan's previous film Tenet either. Three hours felt more like a rush job and was, in my opinion, average."
"I for one can not understand how christopher nolan fools studio executives into giving him money to produce so many terrible films. If they would only give more money to the sound crew, they might not turn the bass subwoofer & one note drone volumes up to 11 & the dialogue down to 2, so that no one has a clue of what is being said or going on.Every screening of this over long, 3 hour bass boosted dross should have sub-titled. You'd think lessons would've been learned from tenet & his previous movies but obviously not.I wish someone else would've made a coherent telling of such an important man & his story.2/10."
"His deep blue eyes lay buried in those sockets as he watched the clouds of death and destruction from a distance. His lips quivered but his face showed no emotion. It's like he's frozen in time. Reading this & then imagining how Cillian portrayed it, you'll realise that you've experienced some rare acting skills.Oppenheimer (played by Cillian), whose life (like the black-and-white to colour-changing frames) has multiple shades. His mind conjures up permutations and combinations of endless possibilities in the field of physics and Nolan perfectly shows those mere monologues in his mind.Performances make the film more of a human experience than watching characters from a history textbook. Robert Downey Jr delivers his career-best performance as Lewis Strauss, Cillian Murphy shakes you to the core as Oppenheimer, Emily blunt has nailed in all the scenes she has appeared in and small but impactful acting of Matt Damon is on point. There are other actors worth mentioning & they done their best too.There's nothing I can write about Direction cause it's done by Nolan. I can only say one thing that Our generation is truly lucky to witness Nolan in his prime. He is one of the last-standing filmmakers of our era who is so true to the craft and magic that films can create. Oppenheimer is not only Nolan's best work to date, but in the world of fast-food cinema, it is an exquisite offering from a top-class chef.Lastly imo ""Oppenheimer"" is easily the best film of 2023."
"I saw this film in the context of the upcoming UAP/UFO disclosure, which is tightly linked to nuclear proliferation. UAP's have taken an interest in nuclear test sites since their inception, including documented cases of them 'turning off' multiple missile and missile silo's, and I think that this is possible what is being referred to as the chain reaction to change the world.I also watched this movie in terms of AI, we can't stop weaponizing it because otherwise someone else will weaponize it, in turn creating another Cold War in which mutual planetary destruction will help keep nations in check.There really are 2 movies here, the one you watch, and the one that underpins the psychopathic nature of our pathological existence on this planet. This is home, there is no planet B, we really need to stop f-ing it up.The way I look at it, we're monkey's with a big red button that says, 'maybe don't push', but look where that's gotten us.Thank Nolan for making us think and making us truly understand the gruesome nature of the military industrial complex, the machine that's still churning and has now found a place to expend It's soon to expire ammunition in the Ukraine conflict, that's practical.When we're no longer here, it's okay because this space rock will keep on turning, even when the human race is burning."
"""Oppenheimer"" is a stellar addition to Christopher Nolan's lineup. This movie showcases Nolan's gift for visuals with stunning cinematography that captures the intensity of its historical backdrop. The performances are top-notch, with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Delivering particularly standout performances, enriching the narrative with their depth and complexity.The film's pace is leisurely, giving audiences time to immerse in the story's vast scope. While some might find this slower rhythm slightly prolonged, it affords a detailed exploration of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life and times.As a long-standing fan of Nolan's work, I hold ""Interstellar"" as his finest creation. This is my personal opinion and does not take away from the brilliance of ""Oppenheimer"". It is a deeply engaging film, filled with memorable performances and spectacular visuals. ""Oppenheimer"" is a must-watch for any Nolan enthusiast and anyone who appreciates masterfully crafted biopics."
"After Oppenheimer atomized an implausible theory born out of his mania, guiltily thinking about the effect of such a cruel atomization makes me wonder how we are living in this era of politicizing science!. If we think about it a little deeper, such thoughts have the potential to drive us to suicide, like the Japanese soldiers who committed ""seppuku"" (meaning ""slitting of the stomach"", a form of Japanese ritual suicide in which samurai death restores honor to themselves and their families) at the end of World War II!.The truth is that Christopher Nolan's writing has seen a depth in this act!. One scene in particular is when someone told Oppenheimer, ""I'm not going to have a part in this project!"" After saying that, he asked, ""To turn science, which has been developed for centuries, into a weapon that takes lives without mercy?"" The verses affected me a lot!It is amazing that Nolan chose actors according to the characters and that such artists dedicated themselves to it!. But what to do, the sentiments of the people of our country are untouchable, so Indian film censorship has been removed in the best interests of the people!."
"I'm over the moon with this film. From the visuals to the dialogue and the score. It is simply a masterpiece. Robert Downey, Jr. And Cillian Murphy both Deserves an Academy award. Cillian holds this film on his shoulders in a way I have never seen before. For 3 hours I was transported back to WW2 and the beginning of the military industrial complex.If you are going to this movie for action or to see the bombing of Hiroshima, you will be disappointed. This movie is a think piece. The challenge is the audience to think on moral levels challenging each of us just because we can should we.I plan on seeing this tomorrow and the day after. I'm sure there were things I missed and can't wait to discover by watching again.Christopher Nolan has definitely outdone himself. If I were him I would be honestly scared of my next project because how can you top this masterpiece. If anyone can I believe he can I just can't wait for his next release."
"This movie was absolutely brilliant. The performance from Cillian Murphy was so genuine as J. Robert Oppenheimer. A perfect performance from him.Robert Downey Jr also had one of the top performances in the film as well. One of the greatest of his career. Give that man an Oscar! Matt Damon, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh and Emily blur also gave incredible performances too. The guy that played Albert Einstein looked exactly like the genius himself I was spooked but in a good way.The sound in this film was a little scary. It physically made me jump, it was sonical.Christopher Nolan's direction on this phenomenal masterpiece was Masterclass and is for me the one to win best director throughout awards season.This movie for me is everything not one bad thing to say. Perfectly written, directed, cast and the production design was on a whole other level. Bless this film one of the greatest films of all time. 10/10."
"I recently witnessed the cinematic marvel 'Oppenheimer,' a gripping character study of the father of the atomic bomb. The movie introduces numerous characters and presents a ton of historical information at breakneck speed, making it challenging to grasp everything in one go. What adds to the complexity is Nolan's fantasy of playing with time - he chooses to tell the story in different timelines, intercutting between them at a frenetic pace. Yet, the film never loses our attention, keeping us engrossed in its mesmerizing narrative.The Trinity test sequence was masterfully directed, leaving a profound impact. Following the Trinity testing, Oppenheimer's address to a gathering was terrifying, evoking a choking sense of tension. The subsequent intense interrogation scene surpassed anything I had seen before, with a phenomenal score and expert sound design that elevated the impact to unimaginable levels.The climactic conversation of Oppenheimer with Einstein, along with the premonition of what he has unleashed, while the camera lingers on his terrifying portrait, is utterly mesmerizing - what a way to end the film!Eager to delve into the actual events and read more about them, I'm certain it will deepen my appreciation for Nolan's genius and the masterpiece he has crafted. I can't wait to rewatch it with newfound insights and admire the brilliance of his work even more."
"I'm glad i saw another Nolan film in the theatre. The amazing soundtrack, beautiful cinematography, outstanding performances... it's a masterpiece that tells the story of a necessary evilonce again, Cillian reminds us that he's one of the goats. Matt Damon is exceptional; the fleeting appearances of Gary Oldman and Casey Affleck don't leave anyone indifferent, and RDJ... in those last twenty minutes he shows that this is the best acting he has ever done in his lifethe Trinity test is one of the best sequences i've ever seen in a movie. Nolan is truly one of the greatest filmmakers of the modern cinema."
"The story is about J. Robert Oppenheimer, lovingly called Oppie, who is (maybe) wrongfully suspected of being a security risk, a suspicion cunningly used by another man who doesn't like Oppie, and therefore Oppie loses his security clearance, but later the second man experiences consequences of his unjust behaviour. Oppie doesn't regain his security clearance but gets decorated, which makes his wife happy. In a sideline to the story several hundreds of thousands of civilians get killed by the bomb Oppie developed, which costs him (Oppie) at least a few nights of good sleep, earning him the title of crybaby by Harry S. Truman."
"Contrary to most other Nolan films, this one I do not see myself watching again. This story about physicists and politicians is just not interesting. The story of the atomic bomb deserved better, by dealing with the bombs and their aftermath instead of some historically obscure character's confirmation hearing, and the grilling Oppenheimer received in the closed-door hearing. The film has no soul, does not resound emotionally. There were no build ups, everything just happened. I didn't learn anything I already knew from Youtube videos when preparing to watch the film (certainly nothing about quantum mechanics or the bomb) since I was told about the challenge of following the story, which I hence had no problem following, particularly about the life of Oppenheimer. In the film he is suddenly an acclaimed physicist, then suddenly a leading candidate to lead the Manhattan project, and so on. Poor Cillian Murphy was just there, I didn't feel anything nor cared about the character, his genius and alleged depravity, his guilty conscience. His wife been mad at him for not fighting back ironically applies to the actor's performance in the film. The guy was apparently as boring in real life as in the film. There was nothing technically outstanding and have no idea why I needed to watch the film in IMAX nor the reason for the black and white scenes."
"Let me start by saying that I enjoyed this movie.All in all, after 3 hours, I felt like my time had been spent well watching a well-crafted, visually and emotionally compelling biography about Robert Oppenheimer.It was good. If you like film, go see it in a theater (in IMAX if possible)However, it is a Christopher Nolan film.Meaning.... A lot of characters to keep track of, longer run time, lots and lots of dialogue, etc.This is not the kind of movie you would turn on in the background while dozing off scrolling on instagram.This movie, you have to stay attentive to the details, dialogue, and the story.BUT, because of this hyper-focused nature of the movie, you truly start to feel the story and emotions behind Oppenheimer, and begin to understand the complex nature of Nolan's story telling. I'd say it's worth the extra focus.Personally, I'd set this as slightly better than Tenet, but not to the lengths of Inception.Go see it :)"
"The best drama ever witnessed, one of the best dramatic experience . Its Nolan's masterpiece, every scene written is a master piece every dialogue, every screenplay has been crafted soo good. Cilian murphy who has just nailed with his performances, he just lived the character of oppenheimer. Oppenheimer is gem in the field of physics and atomic matter. He is soft and introvert which has been portrayed so perfect by murphy, i hope he gets an oscar for his performance in Oppenheimer. All others robert downey, emily , matt and pugh all did their supporting roles to perfect. Especially the strauss role played by our former iron man robert downey jr was world class, hope he gets an oscar too. A special recognition to the music , its the pillar to the movie, soo pure and different and really makes as feel , an ultra realistic experience. Overall an osm drama experience, a complete nolan film with cuts in. Please do watch in theaters."
"A phenomenal watch. It may seem too long but once you are in, you forget everything and the focus is on Murphy. Nolan has given yet another masterpiece. Sound design was fabulous even though there were times when dialogues was overpowered by music.The movie takes you on a journey of Robert Oppenheimer and oh my, it was just amazing.The casting choices were nothing short of brilliant. Christian Bale's portrayal of Oppenheimer was nothing less than extraordinary. He captured the essence of the enigmatic scientist, showcasing his brilliance and inner conflict with remarkable depth and nuance. The supporting cast, including talented actors like Emily Blunt, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Cillian Murphy, delivered performances that were equally captivating and added layers of complexity to the narrative."
"Just seen this movie today and i was completely lost in the world of this movie, 3 hrs passed just like the blink of eyes... This movie is a biography of J Robert Oppenheimer which tells us about how he became the father of atomic bomb and changed the world forever.. Cillian Murphy nailed the titular role without any doubt he is the finest actors of our generation you can see the emotions he shows on screen just by his face and that's how i can say that Christopher Nolan nailed the casting of this movie.. RDJ, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh all are perfectly cast in their roles of these real life persons who changed the course of our history.. RDJ is not just some comedic actor who played Iron Man in MCU but he is also one of the finest actors ever and you can feel this just by seeing his performance in this movie...Tom Conti also shines as legendry Albert Einstein in this movie even though his role of small... Christopher Nolan is able to deliver a masterpiece again in name of this movie which will be remembered for a very long time in future, without any doubt Oppenheimer will become a Classic in future since it's on of the greatest movies ever made...
Screenplay, Music, Cinematography, Pacing everything is just perfect.. If you know just even basic Science like Nuclear fission and fusion, division of atoms, electrons, hydrogen etc you'll love thus movie even more since you can easily understand what is shown on screen.. It just didn't acts as a political movie about World War, Communism but also as a basic human story about Morals, Humanity, God like power to mankind etc..The final scene where Oppenheimer regrets about giving ultimate destructive power to mankind will haunts you forever and that is the beauty of this movie.. We also see the personal lives of some prominent figures of history we go deeply into their thoughts and mind to exactly understand how history is changed by Manhatten project forever...Bottom line Oppenheimer is a peak level cinematic experience crafted masterfully by one of the greatest filmmaker of our generation which you can't miss at any cost.... Go and see it right now."
"Not going to jump on the band wagon, and say that this film was exceptional, brilliant etc... . But I will say that it was interesting to see what went into building the atomic bomb seeing it from a different perspective... (as they have been many movies about the Manhattan Project). The actors, the script, the pace was great; however, the only negative I have for this movie is it could have done without the sex scenes. I am not a prude in any way, but these scenes were totally useless, and had no real bearing on the story telling.... In all honesty, it really seemed like just gratuitous sex to just tick a box for an r-rated movie. But it truly could have done without them. Other than that I thought it was a really good movie."
"Without further ado, ladies and gentlemen:
CHRISTOPHER NOLAN REACHED PERFECTION!The film is the masterpiece of art that cinema tends to be only on rare occasions. One of the rare occasions was on Interstellar, but here... here it went beyond. This is the purest perfection Nolan has achieved.Is a film that will revolutionize cinema, as will almost all films by the same director. The script is amazing, perfect! Makes 3 hours of film feel like 5 minutes!The performances are A-M-A-Z-I-N-G, even from the lead to the extra, everyone in the film deserves the biggest spotlight. My prediction, which will probably be correct, is that Oppenheimer will be the frontrunner for the next Oscar. The performance of everyone in the project brings immersion and many different compliments.The art and sound direction, then, doesn't just deserve applause, they deserve an entire orchestra of celebrations to them!I've already convinced myself that Cillian Murphy, Florence Pugh and Robert Downey Jr. Will be the Oscar winners for best actor, actress and supporting actor.The film revolutionizes, animates, excites...
this is art. This is cinema....that's Christopher Nolan."
"The direction, as expected from Nolan, is nothing short of breathtaking. The way he weaves together past and present, merging personal struggles with scientific achievements, is nothing less than genius. The visuals are stunning, and the attention to detail in recreating the era is impeccable.And then there's Cillian Murphy, whose performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer is a tour de force. Murphy's dedication to the role is evident in every scene. He immerses himself in the character, bringing Oppenheimer's inner turmoil and brilliance to life with such nuance and authenticity that it's simply mesmerizing to watch.The emotional depth Murphy infuses into Oppenheimer's journey is astounding. From his struggles with the moral implications of his work to the personal sacrifices he makes, every aspect of the character is portrayed with precision and grace. Murphy's performance truly elevates the film to another level.If there's one thing I'm certain about after watching ""Oppenheimer,"" it's that Cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar for his outstanding portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer. His performance alone makes this film an unforgettable cinematic experience.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic marvel that leaves a profound impact on the viewer. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction combined with Cillian Murphy's Oscar-worthy performance makes this film an absolute must-watch. It's a masterpiece that will linger in your mind long after the credits roll."
"Such a good movie, but if you're clearly not interested at all in history, Oppenheimer, the Manhattan project, then obviously this will be boring for you. I do not know what people expected, all these negative reviews feel like little kids upset the teacher showed them a documentary in school or something.I was originally going to give this 9/10 because they definitely did hype up the explosion, saying they made it with practical effects but honestly it's the one thing that may have just been better with CGI. They definitely missed the mark on that, but then I realized it doesn't matter.This is essentially a drama, focusing on Oppenheimer's life and it was really interesting to see how it all actually happened, all the ""boring"" stuff they never usually talk about get captured really well.For example, I never knew much about Los Alamos, the extent to which Oppenheimer was or wasn't involved, and never really had a great picture on where this really fit in scientific history until after this movie.It's of course very thought provoking. It's not the type of movie to be watched twice, in my opinion, but very interesting as long as you're (again) interested in the actual subject of the movie. It's not going to bring in any strange plot twists like aliens invading the Earth, and it won't be action packed. I'm still glad I saw it in theaters because the sound and visuals are pretty amazing for what it is (not action packed.) It's definitely not like a Christopher Nolan movie, think more like Titanic (which I thought was boring as well when I was a little kid.)"
"Based on the 700-page tome ""American Prometheus"", Christopher Nolan's three-hour biographical thriller about the 'father of the atomic bomb', J. Robert Oppenheimer, is no less of an epic.That is not to say that the movie is slow or takes its time: On the contrary, ""Oppenheimer"" suffers from a restless and rushed pace. Especially during the exposition, it feels as though Nolan was trying to cram all of Oppenheimer's life before the Manhattan project into a breathless sequence of inadvertently comical video clips - in the style of ""This happened in the previous episode"".It goes without saying that we do not deeply get to know 'Oppie' this way: Little do we learn about his formative years, his love of poetry, his deep-rooted anxieties and contradictions, his life-changing relationship with Jean Tatlock and his concomitant exposure to communism and politics at large. The movie fails to explore Oppenheimer's inner conflicts, motivations, and feelings... which makes him a rather distant and enigmatic protagonist.This rush might be forgivable if it somehow served to set up an intriguing narrative. After all, part of what makes Nolan such a mesmerizing director are his deeply original ideas that leave us stunned and contemplating the fabric of our existence: what defines our memories, our dreams or reality, or simply time? ""Oppenheimer"" does leave you slightly confused, but its tornado-like whirl of different timelines and perspectives revolves around a rather hollow narrative. Once the atomic dust settles, there is little left - nothing insightful we have learned about the quantum world and the nuclear bomb, about science and its societal responsibilities, about peace and war. Just a rather petty political intrigue.That is not to say that the movie is wholly unengaging. After all, one of Nolan's strengths is his visual style, and ""Oppenheimer"" showcases the director's mastery of the large screen and its effects. I didn't watch it at an Imax theater, but even in a cozier setting, one can marvel at the overwhelming cinematography. The movie also features some breathtaking scenes, such as the famous Trinity test, recreated with minimal CGI and a real explosion. Ironically, this is also just about the only moment where the audience are granted a moment of peace and quiet in the otherwise annoyingly ubiquitous and monotonous soundtrack.Christopher Nolan's impressive body of work has earned him seemingly complete artistic freedom from budgetary or other constraints. In recent years, he has used this to make increasingly bombastic and grandiose movies. However, I can't help wondering if this license is an unconditional blessing - or whether Nolan's true talents get somewhat drowned out by the temptation to create ever more expensive special effects and cast yet more stars. In retrospect, films like ""Memento"" or even ""Inception"" feel almost modest and focused."
"The acting was amazing, the cinematography was also amazing, but thats where the good ends and the bad starts. 3 hours are you kidding me? This story could have been done in an hour forty-five with credits. There was too much filler garbage i was immediately annoyed. Glorifying the smartest people creating the biggest bomb after the worlds best scientific discovery was sickening. I know that was true, but it made me sick. Showing how twisted and demented our government is was a great idea. There is literally too many things i want to say but don't know how to word them. I highly recommend everyone see something else and save a lot of time. Watch this at home after it hits netflix."
"The movie talks about the moral dilemma of making an atomic bomb, and that helps Oppenheimer, who is obsessed with quantum physics, learn about the atomic field by making an atomic bomb, but what makes him make the bomb is more than his scientific interests; it's about his ideological politics. The movie makes me think more about Oppenheimer as a politician than a scientist at the end of the movie.I think the movie is boring for me because it's longer than I want, but the story of Oppenheimer is not about entertainment; it's about politics and history, and you need to watch this film. I don't believe I will see a nuclear war, and that doesn't make the movie important. As I said, the movie is important for how civilizations think during war or even in peacetime; if you think the movie is about just nuclear war, that's not correct.The cinematography is remarkable; it's very clean. I haven't seen this high quality of cinematography; even Hoyte van Hoytema's previous work didn't look like that.The soundtrack by Ludwig Göransson is very technological, as in his previous works, and classical at the same time, and the theme reminds me of Vangelis's works, especially the soundtrack called ""Destroyer of Worlds.""."
"Oppenheimer's fascination with the concept of a black hole or the theory of relativity are Nolan obsessions. He's dabbled in time, relativity and black holes before, just how was he going to make this history lesson so entertaining?I asked myself that question time and time again, I'd purposely put off watching any trailer or video beforehand, I promised myself I wouldn't spoil anything, I even went as far as going to the loo when the trailer came on before Mission Impossible.When the film started, it introduced two timelines and my mind went 'This is a definitely a Nolan film'.It not only surprised me, it surpassed all of my expectations. This film is and will forever be the highlight of his filmmaking in my eyes, the narrative is complicated, going in circles, detours and jumping back and forth and back again... the complexity in which the scenes were shown, how he puts so much emphasis on (and makes us believe or even feel) Oppenheimers emotional state throughout is absolutely astounding.As I said before, the narrative is complicated to say the least, even if you and I were history experts and the narrative was more linear, the governmental secrets, complicated science, speeches and world politics would make it uneasy to fully understand or appreciate without a little help. But, Nolan purposely made everything harder for himself here, that's why Nolan is so great at what he does, he takes something and doesn't care if it takes time to explain, he doesn't cut any corners to make it easier for the viewer and he certainly doesn't want you to fully understand everything straight away. He wants you to literally fall into this universe he creates whilst the story unfolds on screen. This is why we all adore his storytelling, he's a masterful director, one without a rival. Nobody else comes close.The film basically plays through three acts, with the last hour being the final act, the more Nolan act of the three, this is where he really plays on what came before and opens up that web of sorts. I'd love to dissect here, but that would spoil the whole film for those unfortunate enough to have not seen it yet.One of Nolans biggest trademarks is his use of cross editing and epic music, there's a very unique rhythmical, Operatic nature to how his films flow and how his editing works. Oppenheimer is up there with the likes of Inception and Interstellar, his editing is even more on point here. But, it hasn't always 'worked' though, Tenet overdid what mesmerised me with his previous films, the sound editing for that film was just awful, but Nolan definitely listened to the complaints and did a tremendous job with this.This is some of the best acting in a Nolan film, Cillian Murphy is incredible and so is Robert Downey Jr, that third act plays with the characters in an interesting way. Some Oscar nods here for sure...In Conclusion, it's as dense and awe-inspiring as his best films, an audiovisual masterpiece, one where he excels at what he is good at. Yet, it offers new challenges for him, as challenging as this was, he nailed it and is now a career highlight.This is a must see for anyone, you cannot and will not be disappointed. I'm still in a state of shock from those last minutes...If you've not watched this yet, I don't know what you're waiting for, get out there and watch!"
"I have now seen this movie twice, once in regular cinema and once in 1570 IMAX. Even though it was an outstanding movie in regular cinema, I highly encourage you to see it in 1570 IMAX. It wasn't just a completely different experience, it was eye opening how films can be shot and watched.The obvious is that Cillian Murphy will take home the Oscar for best Actor in a leading role because wow he just destroyed every single scene!I can't tell you who was the best support cast member because there were so many that deserve recognition from Downey Jnr to Gary Oldman as President Truman.After watching the movie the first time I researched more and more about these events and it actually made the second viewing more enjoyable! I recommend watching it first without researching anything and then diving deep into the story and watching it again!"
"Coming back after watching Oppenheimer.Won't give any spoilers but man, what a masterpiece nolan has created.No fancy cgi, no modern transitions.Pure storytelling.Cillian Murphy is indeed the best choice for playing Oppenheimer.Not only his acting skills but he literally tells the story by his eyes.Rest of the cast also did justice with the movie.The only thing I felt that story took a bit more time to build than it normally should've.Just go watch it alone or with someone who wants to seek knowledge and love science and history.Don't expect any action sequences cause there aren't anyCan't wait to watch it again in Imax."
"The film lays out a journey of humanity's character that which we've never recovered. Powerful evils are perpetrated by such noble ""idealism"" from either side & the ""good"" versus evil debates remain only for the winners to portray the virtues of their side. It's a sickening gut wrenching film of such unimaginable horrors behinds it's subject matter of 2 dropped bombs never explained nor given detail. Only by the films very existence will humanity have yet another example of humankind's ""art"" ego telling war horror for entertainment, no idealism, no whimsical warnings, instead this seems instead a truth. Our very worst imaginings are only outdone by those with the power & ego to forgo their soul to achieve anything for nothing but horror. :Macbeth Tomorrow Tomorrow Tomorrow...."
"'Oppenheimer' - Riveting plot, stellar performances, and breathtaking visuals make it one of the greatest movies of all time!I can't stop thinking about its brilliant sound design, Ludwig Göransson's phenomenal background score, Nolan's Direction and the legendary performances!Robert Downey Jr. Simply stole the show.. His portrayal of Lewis Strauss was exceptional!Cillian Murphy finally got his chance to showcase his brilliant acting skills.. Could not have asked for a better person to play Oppenheimer...Jason Clarke's portrayal of Roger Rob was something that I was not expecting to be that great.. But it turned out that it was one of the best performances of this movie..It is a near impossible task to point out literally one single bad performance by any actor or actress in this movie. The casting of this movie is nearly immaculate.You need to be really attentive while watching this movie. If you'll divert your mind for a minute or two, you might miss out some important plot details.The visuals and sound design of this movie is top notch! Nolan wanted Zimmer to compose the soundtrack but he went with Göransson. And in my opinion, he did a phenomenal job.'Oppenheimer' has established a place in my 'Top 10 Favourite Movies Of All Time'.. This is a movie, which I will watch again and again and again.. for the rest of my life.."
"Another masterpiece created by the genius Nolan. Everything in this movie is top notch: The acting performances, the directing, the writing, the editing, the sound, the production, the cinematography, the score, even the make up and costume design.Nolan should get an oscar nommination for best director. Cillian Murphy should get an oscar nommination for best actor just for his eyes expression only :). Too many great supporting actors/actresses that should get oscar nommination too (RDJ, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Jason Clarke, even Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, Casey Affleck).This is a work of art in a movie format."
"If you're looking for a movie that has a great storytelling, amazing acting and the right amount of astonishing cinematography, you should not search any further. 'Oppenheimer' has it all. But if you're expecting a breathtaking piece of media, you should continue in your journey.Honestly, it is quite saddening that such a beautiful piece of media lacks something so important as is the spark of originality.As someone who comes from a nation that releases one big biopic in cinema per year, I have seen a lot of different artistic visions for this genre. Now, combine this with my love for psychological dramas and thrillers and you get a pretty solid base for understanding what I'm trying to say.As much as I loved all the physics talk, the contrasts between the inner world of Oppenheimer and the reality around him and the suspense, it was not something I've seen for the first time ever. After three hours, I was not leaving the cinema bored, yet, I was rather annoyed. Everywhere I looked were 10/10s, 9/10s, but I just felt like I'd watched a blank template filled with really cool words and sentences.Some might say ""omg, she does not understand, she does not know her film stuff"", but that's it...for 6 years of my life I've been preparing for studying at a film university (though unsuccessfully for practical reasons), I know the basics of film theory and I undertook some courses on the matter...and from film theory standpoint the movie IS basically immaculate, but that's all. Plain. Distant. Overhyped. Just another movie.Calling 'Oppenheimer' Christopher Nolan's best movie and maybe the best movie to ever exist is even over its beauty certainly an overreach and to be honest if you say this, I think you might need to see more movies."
"The movie was ok. There were some cool scenes, great acting, fantastic cinematography, and excellent sound design.The problem I really had with the movie was the sex scenes. They felt out of place. It was shocking to say the least seeing that in the theater. I looked away to be honest because I didn't really want to see that. I don't think it was crucial to the story, there are certainly ways to imply what happened without explicitly showing things.I love Christopher Nolan's movies. I think he is a fantastic filmmaker. For me, this film just didn't hit the mark. I felt more taken out than anything because of some of the content. I still have mixed feelings and I'm not sure what to think."
"""Oppenheimer,"" directed by Christopher Nolan, is one of the most hotly anticipated movies of 2023... for reasons I don't really understand. Screenings nationwide are selling out, thanks in part to the recent #Barbenheimer double feature craze; critics and audiences are raving about the film, flocking to see it in Imax; but what is it exactly about the film that has people in such a frenzy? I wish I knew, because to be quite honest, ""Oppenheimer"" didn't resonate with me.The allure of ""Oppenheimer"" is threefold: 1) Christopher Nolan has garnered a dedicated fan base over the years, with a unique and often mind-bending approach to filmmaking; 2) The subject matter of ""Oppenheimer"" might contribute to its buzz, with the film delving into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a prominent figure in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II; and 3) The movie promises explosive, practical special effects that should have audiences cowering in fear when the bomb finally goes off. And as the film delves into the historical events surrounding the development of the atomic bomb, the meticulous attention to visual detail is aimed at immersing viewers into the momentous and world-changing events of the past. So, on one hand, I do recognize, and admire, the positives of this movie. On the other hand, ""Oppenheimer"" is still a three hour long film that is comprised of nothing but people having long, drawn out scientific conversations - which is both a strength and a challenge, depending on individual viewer preferences. For me, this aspect was a challenge.I honestly found this to be a boring movie, with only a handful of brilliant scenes throughout, all occurring in the final hour of the film. The testing of the bomb and the aftermath, the hearings and conversations therein, the bombing and the reactions to it - all of those sequences were bordering on masterful, thanks in part to the brilliant performances that permeate the film. However, the build up to these sequences mean that you'll be sitting through two hours of agonizingly incomprehensible - and often forgettable - dialogue.Listen, I didn't connect with, or care about, the conversations the characters were having about atoms and hydrogen and whatever else they were talking about, and I could not relate to the conversations that occurred in this film; some of my favorite movies are nothing but dialogue - but dialogue, to be entertaining, has to be sharp and exciting, relatable and dramatic, engaging and memorable. Well-crafted dialogue adds depth to characters, drives the plot forward, and keeps the audience invested in the story. In ""Oppenheimer,"" however, the dialogue only manages to put viewers to sleep... or at least it did in my case. And because ""Oppenheimer"" is a movie that is basically nothing but dialogue, and because the dialogue didn't manage to strike a chord with me, the majority of the movie fell flat.And that's about all I have to say about this movie, because I honestly wasn't a huge fan. Yes, the acting is good, as are the practical effects and the direction. But beyond that, nothing resonated with me personally, besides a handful of scenes during the final 60 minutes of the film. That said, I know I'm in the minority here with my opinion, so my recommendation is to go out and watch the film, because you'll probably enjoy it more than I did."
"The movie is so great , it takes time and you will feel the length of it but when all things come together it becomes one of the best move you'll ever see.If you hated breaking bad and felt like it was long , overrated and boring, you'll feel the same about Oppenheimer.The movie isn't the best Christopher movie but it's so amazing and worth watching, and I'm confused by the amount of people who compare it to Barbie.Come on guys I mean Barbie is a meme movie but not a movie that you can compare it to Oppenheimer like a real bomb was blown in this movie and you're going to compare it to a fantasy children movie ?Like be for real and rate to the normal standards.Another banger from Christopher Nolan."
"This film is one of those in which you do not realize the time that passes, despite having extensive dialogues, it does not become heavy even for its 3 hours. If you like the history from the perspective of its protagonist and you have slight notions of context, you will like it. You don't need to be an expert in physics or history at all.With respect to the main character, it is important that he is not presented as a perfect person, since in many films of this standard style, defects are minimized, not here, Oppenheimer is shown as a sometimes ambivalent person, who sometimes Attimes he doubts his actions and sometimes he is surpassed in knowledge by hiscolleagues. I also think that the inclusion of Jean's secondary history and his false communist past was good since it supports the argument and serves as a common thread for the unfounded defendants about what it is a danger to the security of the nation.The inclusion of Einstein was risky, but it achieved its objective without falling into a classic caricature of it.Regarding the performances, R. Dawney Junior's was spectacular, sometimes unrecognizable and generated a real feeling of rejection as a true ""villain"" that he is and of course also to highlight the performance of Emily Blunt as the wife of Oppenheimer, his main support and defender at times when the protagonist was defeated and passive.In technical aspects, I think the explosion was overrated but not misleading since that exaggerated idea that would leave you breathless was installed by the fans themselves, the real emotion and tension was felt seconds before the explosion itself.When leaving the cinema I left a little disoriented since at times I felt that there were scenes that did not fit together and I am not referring to the changes in the timeline, but in those that respect Los Alamos.I thought there would be a scene of the explosion of the h-bomb in Japan, but it did not happen, at first I was disappointed, but I understood that the focus of the film would have been lost by transforming it into another war movie and that with the scene of the charred body.All in all, It's an excellent movie, but not Nolan's best."
"I would like to talk about the Oppenheimer movie after I entered the cinema today. Indeed, this movie is really an example of movies that are made for the cinema, not for the home. I would like to stress that this movie is not for all people. Yizenberg and many others, and all the details surrounding the Manhattan Project, whether announced or unknown, surprised me in the film and made me amazed that the film demonized America and its government. Literally, some of its people gather America in this movie. It was a demon. In a scene of Oppenheimer with the president of America after the Hiroshima and Nagasaki explosion, Oppenheimer tells the president, I feel that my hands are stained with blood. 250,000 people were on his neck, he felt about themselves and their suffering throughout his life, and in the end, his country fought him and made him a traitor, and at the end of his life they honored him after he accepted on himself that he was fighting with all those around him in order to only reduce the guilt that he felt. And I will not forget Oppenheimer Einstein's sentence when he said that there was an opportunity in the Manhattan Project that we are destroying the world with our invention. The truth is that we really destroyed the world, and the feeling of arrogance kept haunting him all his life. This movie is as sweet as it is, but it is dark and depicts the black history of mankind. Not only the future is the one that is full of injustice and corruption, not the past. I was afraid that he would fall into the point of drumming for America and filming it in the role of angel, like most directors, and I wanted him to at least take the field of neutrality, but it surprised me when he portrayed history as black as it is in the past after Germany's withdrawal and Hitler's suicide, and Japan was the salvation of itself, and this is how it will lose, but America also designed a nuclear strike to test it and show its strength."
"I watched it on imax and This is one if not the best theatre experience that I've ever scene
and i think at least you should watch it on a really biggest screen as possible because believe me this is a truly another experience that may have not seen before
nolan storytelling on it's peak but I understand that this film may be not everyone cup of tea
So don't be fool by any review you see
You must watch it and make your own thoughts about it.Nolan gives us a biographical film but by his own way
The film is such a horror and horrible in a good way , the impact that leaved me after watching it. Just a SHOCK
It's not just a great movie it's really beyond that
One of the most important film in this century . We are experiencing the consequences , fears, and dilemmas of the events narrated in the story so far."
"Oppenheimer (2023) chronicles the true story of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), his involvement in the Manhattan Project, and the events that unfolded in the aftermath.Wow wow wow, where do I begin? Let's start with the cast shall we? Because they were exceptional. Cillian was marvellous throughout and RDJ (as Lewis Strauss) was seriously outstanding, especially towards the end in that one particular scene (you guys probably know which scene I'm talking about if you've seen the movie). Now I can see what people were talking about when they said his performance was Oscar-worthy. Cillian's is too to be fair, let me just make that clear. Even the likes of Emily Blunt (as Kitty Oppenheimer) and Florence Pugh (as Jean Tatlock) were genuinely amazing in their albeit smaller roles. And boy, I knew the cast was stacked but not this stacked. Many of the other supporting actors were fantastic too: Rami Malek (as David Hill), Tom Conti (as Albert Einstein), David Dastmalchian (as William Borden), Dane DeHann (as Kenneth Nichols), Benny Safdie (as Edward Teller), Alden Ehrenreich (as Richard Feynman), David Krumholtz (as Isidor Isaac Rabi), and perhaps more who I don't think are being given enough praise.The score. Oh my god the score. Huge credit to Ludwig Göransson because it was absolutely breathtaking, and it really got my heart racing. The VFX and SFX were mesmerising and utterly riveting, even if they were a little overdone in my opinion. The sound wasn't perfect though. Even though you could actually hear the dialogue in this film (unlike Christopher Nolan's other movies), I still would've liked the music to be a little quieter so that we could hear it more clearly. Also, some of the sounds were... weird. During the Trinity Test it sounds like someone's shuffling out of bed, I'm not exaggerating, I honestly think that's how they got the sound, but why not just use the actual sound?? As a result of Nolan's stupidity, it made me laugh during what was supposed to be perhaps the most intense scene in the entire picture. But I digress, since either way, I would still expect this to win the Best Sound and Best Original Score Oscars, that's how good the audio was, seriously.In case you're wondering if the movie drags, considering it's a 3 hour picture, for me I would say it does a bit during the closed hearing scenes after The Trinity Test, but I was so engrossed in the film that I was loving it regardless. Some people might say that the first hour or so where we get to know about Oppenheimer's background before joining the Manhattan Project drags too, but for some reason I loved it. There wasn't even anything in particular about that part of the movie that you would say was entertaining per se, but seeing it in the theater, added with the thrilling score in the background, I guess just made me feel so immersed that no matter what was on screen, I was relishing it.Just to warn you, this picture is not necessarily in chronological order. There's a lot of flash forwards and flash backs. Think of it as two different timelines, which Nolan switches between at various points in the movie. Nolan actually tries to make this clear at the start by numbering each timeline 1 and 2, but even then, the less eagle-eyed amongst you may struggle to get a complete grasp on things, so just make sure you're paying attention. I personally managed to understand what was going on and because of that I actually really liked the two timelines thing, it makes this feature stand out compared to any ordinary film. It also made me quickly realise that this isn't just about the tragedies caused by the Manhattan Project, which is what my impression was from the trailer. There's a reason it's called Oppenheimer. It's about him, his story, his perspective of the Manhattan Project, so it's good that this was made explicit from very early on.But why am I giving this a 9 and not a 10? Because this isn't what I expected. This isn't what I wanted from this feature. After the bombings, I wanted to see a lot lot more on Oppenheimer's realisation at the calamities he has caused. I wanted devastation. Instead, the events after were predominantly about the hearing, which is a shame. This picture really should've focused on the immorality and tragedy of it all. Yes, we did get a little bit of that, but not enough. I expected to feel emotional myself when going to watch this, but no. I'm slightly disappointed as a result, because I wanted to feel heartbroken, I wanted that hard-hitting impact which I was craving, but it never arrived.But having said all that, this was absolutely spectacular, a one-of-a-kind movie. You have GOT to watch this in cinemas before it is too late. It's an unmissable cinematic experience. I cannot stress that enough."
"1 - An absolute stinker of a film, with no redeeming features. It's unlikely that any film will receive this score.2 - Oh, not great at all. Amongst the worst films ever made.3 - I won't be back, and am less than pleased I've just spent time watching this.4 - Very poor effort. Struggled through.5 - Mediocre. Nothing special at all, but not completely unbearable.6 - Tries hard. On its way to worthwhile.7 - Solid viewing. Can't complain - would recommend.8 - Cracking. Enjoyed immensely. But it takes a lot to get 9.9 - It takes a lot to get 910 - An absolute banger of a film. Couldn't be better. It's unlikely that any film will receive this score."
"Man I can't describe how I feel , I feel amazed, I feel sad , I feel emotional. I really wish to watch that movie again if could, like who wouldn't like that peace of masterpiece, Christopher Nolan never let you down when he directs a movie.that Man will be the best director to ever come in history. I can't believe what he did honestly. The film is perfect in many ways
The music in the background, the graphics, the acting prefromance from the actors , the filming. I'll be so sad if they didn't at least win 4 Oscars awards I'll be so f#ckin mad , at last I really do recommend to watch the film at least 2 times and yeah that's all."
"Films Are Generally Considered Just A Source Of Entertainment, But There Are Few Films That Leave A Deep Impact On You... Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" Is One Such Film... It's Superbly Crafted, The Characters Are Very Well-Written, All The Actors (Cilian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Tom Conti) Have Given Their Best & Last But Not The Least, It Is Easily One Of The Most Visually Impressive Movies Of All Time... If There's A Definition Of Perfect Anywhere In The World Than This One Completely Satisfies That Definition... It's My Humble Request, Whoever's Reading This Review, Please Book Your Tickets & Experience It On The Biggest Screen Possible."
"The love for this movie is very perplexing. I keep reading words like ""masterpiece"" to describe it and I just don't see it. What I saw was a disjointed mess! No character development and very poor story telling. I suppose its erratic quality was intentional on the part or the director (perhaps to help us into the mind of Oppenheimer), but it most certainly didn't land for me. I checked the clock a lot. Had I been watching it on streaming, I'd probably have turned it off after the first 30 minutes or so.A lot of folks seemed to have problems with the sex scenes, saying they didn't add to the movie. I actually disagree. I felt the sex scenes stressed Oppenheimer's immature attitude toward women and really his general attitude towards others. I suppose this could have been accomplished without nudity, but I thought the sex scenes made sense in the context of an otherwise confusing narrative.I suppose the acting was decent, but the script was so boring it gave the actors little to work with. It felt so emotionless and lifeless to me. Most of Nolan's work feels that way to me. Even Murphey seemed bored by the role and not always sure of the character he was playing. Emily Blunt had that pointed scene towards the end, but for the most part, I was unsure of her character and her place in the film. I'd have been curious to see this same story told by Aaron Sorkin or Ron Howard or Wolfgang Peterson. Bottom line - snore. In fact I think I did doze off a few times."
"After many hits and masterful films such as Interstellar & Inception, I always highly anticipated Nolan's movies.Tenet was a huge disappointment and you could see his style getting out of hand, overcomplicating filmmaking and making it not consumable by casual movie fans who want to enjoy a movie without having to watch it multiple times.Oppenheimer is one step worse, because it was a much simpler storyline which did not have a fancy backstory and unique concept, it was a story to be told. Nolan failed big in doing so. The storyline wasn't well communicated and the characters weren't introduced properly.3 hours could have been 100 minutes. He totally missed big opportunities as well.I don't plan on watching any more Nolan movies in the future. Huge disappointment.Poor movie overall."
"Don't watch this movie if you want to see how the first Atom bomb was made or the WWII ended.Watch it if you love brilliant dialogues. The dialogues are master piece and so is the switch from current time frame to the past and back.The characters have played their roles brilliantly. Murphy and Robert have done justice to their characters, so has Matt.The movie is long, 180 plus minutes and that is where it captures the details and the essence of the court room drama. Doesn't stay in one time frame for so long that you get bored and swaps to past frame to make it relevant and a bit confusing at the same time (don't get me wrong with confusing word as it might get tricky if you don't follow the dialogues).This is not Interstellar, so don't go expecting to see space crafts and bombs and fights. The fight is in the courtroom for everyone to see."
"Oppenheimer, a truly masterpiece movie made just for the big screen. Best movie of the year and one of the greatest movie of our generation. This movie is not for casual movie watchers (wasn't that obvious?) But fir those who know how to appreciate real cinema. This movie needs to be understood in a way u never did. You want horror and science in a three hours long movie? This is it. Can't explain the feeling it set off inside us. I had been waiting for this movie since it's announcement and I am not disappointed, the movie feels like its slow but once it's over it feels like nothing. It leaves a deep impact on you."
"I've been waiting for this movie for like two years ever since the very first news broke. Cillian Murphy has made a deep impression on me as Thomas Shelby and I knew how he had insane screen presence. It's not often you see a movie that you've been anticipating for years. There's very few directors like Chris Nolan (perhaps none) who can pull people to the theaters the way he does (I watched a 2pm Saturday movie in a small-ish town and the cinema was packed).My experience with Oppenheimer was largely positive, which is a feat considering how much anticipation I had going in and was well aware of the widespread praise it was receiving. It truly was a cinematic experience and a very maximalist movie in a sense. The ensemble cast consisting of Murphy, Blunt, Damon, Downey, Pugh (although her role was not super significant) and many other recognizable faces, worked well and nobody dropped the ball. I would love to see Cillian win Oscars for this movie because portraying a complex character as Oppenheimer with such weight is a monumental feat. The audiovisual experience was quite top notch with Ludwig Gorasson and van Hoytema for music and cinematography. The one scene where Oppenheimer gives a speech after the bombing was one of the most disturbing scenes I've seen on cinema in a while.In a way, Oppenheimer is a near perfect movie. Its 3h runtime surprisingly did not feel long and I was a little sad that the movie ended. My one complaint about the movie is that it's almost TOO maximalist. The movie's source material was Oppenheimer's 700 page biography called ""American Prometheus"" and the movie did condense that into a movie. It felt like the movie was on full gas for 3 hours (especially the score barely ever actually stopping for 3 hours). There was no loose moment, no room for breathing and was overall very fast-paced that was almost hard to keep up, especially with so many events and characters. This does make me think that multiple viewing of this movie will help better appreciate it but it will definitely lessen the magic of viewing it for the first time.I love movies that embody the art of subtlety and Oppenheimer was not that. It was dramatic for all of its duration and that worked successfully for me as I was completely engaged in the movie for that long. But I wish that the writing was trimmed a bit more and spent more time in key moments instead of rushing through them. The 4.5 I am giving is a 4.5 that's very close to a 5 but I just couldn't feel the same way. I do want to make clear that it was an amazing experience and worth the hype. It just was not a 5 movie for me."
"This movie brings people to life! This movie made me feel like I was part of the whole story! If you go and watch it, please watch it in IMAX, cause the whole movie brings everything in the whole industry in prospective! I loved the performance of every single one of the actors/actresses and I think the whole cast is chosen precisely and perfect for the whole movie's context! I loved the whole history lesson lol, but I loved the most the thought of our scary world that we live in! We have to think more about the people in the world, than ourselves and other opinions and the light of the projectors! Go and watch it! You won't regret it!"
"They are movies that ""make"" themselves. Then they are actors who ""make"" movies. Finally, they are directors whose recognizable style and cinematic experience ""make"" an awesome movie.Christopher Nolan has established himself as one of those directors. The cinema I went to was packed, although it has already been out for a week as of the time of writing. This is remarkable.With ""Oppenheimer"", he has achieved an intimate as well as grand artistic blockbuster.At first, I had slight skepticism when I heard that Nolan would make a biopic. But any doubt was atomized by this masterful film talking in a genuinely creative way about the notorious ""father of the atom bomb"", a rather undesirable attribute.The biographical nature of this film finds itself woven into a creative narrative construct, which does not cover the entirety of Oppenheimer's path. Many movies like to market their depicted characters or story as world-changing and of singular importance, but this rarely is true. Oppenheimer, as the creator of the first large-scale ultra-lethal mass destruction weapon, which had historical, scientifical, geopolitical, and psychological consequences up to this day is no doubt one where the designation is, let's say, quite fitting.The storytelling has one slight issue. An issue that was also found in Nolan's ""Tenet"". Nolan overrates the smartness of his viewers. Or, seen from a different perspective, is just too smart for us. At least some of us. Think of the way he often presents characters or historical events without a proper introduction. Or some historical events are presented. But one can not criticize a movie for being too sharp, or can one? This is also adequate considering the brilliance of the physical mastermind, polyglot, articulate Robert J. Oppenheimer.I liked the way the movie also depicted the flaws (infidelity, mental issues, regrets) of its titular character.What I found interesting, too, was that the length of the film did not feel like a tiresome three hours due to the fast pace of it.As to be expected, the cinematography (when was it ever less-then-splendid in Nolan films ?), the VFX, the production design, and the music are top-notch. Goransson's energetic soundtrack considerably adds to the engrossing nature of the film.More than ever, the ensemble of this film is really something: Damon, Branagh, Blunt, Downey, and much more. Of all these, Murphy leaves the best impression with his theatrical meticulousness. The Oscar nomination is inevitable, hopefully.I was also surprised, furthermore, by some scenes unrecognizable for Nolan, like the use of black and white or the shockingly revealing sex scene, that came a bit out of nowhere.Visually striking, fascinatingly, and creatively told, qualitative in all existing cinematic departments, Nolan did it again. It feels real and meaningful, as any good movie should.I eagerly await Nolan's next film which shall undoubtedly be a new awe-inspiring cinematic experience."
"For a 3hr long film this movie doesn't drag at all. Oppenheimer flies by and the story is told very rapidly, building the tension so well while building towards the Trinity test. At first I didn't know how I felt about the speed but after watching the film in full I completely understand why Christopher Nolan made that choice. The performances are astonishing across the table with the standouts being Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr, and Emily Blunt. They are surrounded by a top tier supporting cast (some with only one or two scenes). Everyone knocks it out of the park and showed up knowing what they were expected to do.Every scene is intentional and I truly don't believe you could cut anything out of this movie and say it would be a better film because of it. The one minor gripe I have is related to the character Jean played by Florence Pugh. I would have loved to see more of that relationship. As it stands, it wasn't the most impactful and I believe some scenes would have benefited emotionally if that character was given some more screen time. This will be one of the most remembered films of the year and I will be shocked if it isn't nominated in nearly every category at the Academy Awards. Bravo Nolan, Bravo!"
"The movie is awesomI advise anyone to see a movie whose story is universal and sweet. Cillian Murphy excelled in the character of Robert Oppenheimer And I will go to watch it on the 21st in Iraqi cinemas. The movie is awesome and very strong. I recommend it. The strength of the movie gives you an experience of art and hardshipI don't know why this legendary work is being compared to the failed Barbie movie Opheimer will win an Oscar, an integrated film in all respects, a historical and biographical film I advise you to watch it in IMAX cinemas Don't forget to add me on Instagram, my name a.dq4."
"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer may be the most expertly crafted and intelligent movie I've seen in the past decade. The scope of the film was ambitious, but if there's anyone that can do it, it's Christopher Nolan. The visuals are almost all practical and it pays off, this movie is stunning to look at from the first frame to its last. The cinematography also plays a part in this. The cast, acting, and dialogue are all perfectly selected, acted, and written. Specifically, the acting from Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh are all phenomenal. The pacing is fantastic though once you get to the court scenes towards the end of the movie it can drag a little, but it's nothing drastic The message of the movie being ""just because you can do something doesn't always mean you should"" is perfect for Robert Oppenheimer's story. The movie is great in IMAX just like Nolan promised, though I don't believe it is necessary to get the full experience of the movie like he said. The reality is, I don't see any obvious negatives to this film so this is a rare 10 out of 10 movie for me, and I hope everyone gets to go see it."
"This movie is a masterpiece , I could not find a flaw with it .The acting of this movie was the star , the story , cinematography and direction co star .What can you say about such a serious subject and defining moment in human history . Well Nolan and the cast delivered a fantastic representation of this time .I recommend this movie it is a grand scale cinematic experience .Cillian will get Oscar , Matt Damon , Robert Downy JR. All deserve Oscar's .Every part played to perfection the supporting cast was just brilliant .The sets just perfect .This is movie making as it should be ."
"If you have even a passive interest in the subject or the politics behind the topic, uts a good movie. Casual viewers may get lost.The story was chaotic with many characters to follow. And tge editing style.made it difficult at times to follow. Alot of jumping around.And the score overshadowed the dialog at times. So loud it seemed out of place.It's kind of like Dunkirk. Very underwhelmed considering the hype. For instance, the size and scope of the Los Alamos town wasn't portrayed very well, kind of like how the size and scope.of Dunkirk evacuation fell flat.Good not but not great. Enjoyed it but wouldn't see it again."
"The movie was NOT about the Manhattan Project!!The core of the movie turns out to be about Lewis Strauss personal vendetta against Oppenheimer!!I don't mind a good political drama about vengeance. The problem was that the political drama in the movie was not interesting at all. It was a bore!! Frankly the Oppenheimer-Strauss hostilities are not an interesting subject.I did not care about the Oppenheimer hearings. The movie tries to create some twists and intrigue but it did not work. It does not matter how much dramatic music you put in scenes it still did not work.Nolan is good adding dramatic music to enhance scenes that, in reality are mundane.To make things worse the movie editing was terrible! The movie kept jumping from scene to scene in a hurry with not connection between them. We don't know anything about the time and location between scenes!The editing is so fast and the scenes are so short and all over the place that the characters don't have time to breath! The characters development was an afterthought!At the end I did not care about any character!If you expect a movie about science this is not it. If you expect a movie about the process and sacrifices of creating the Manhattan Project, the process of creating the atomic bomb with all the science trials and errors this is not for you.At least 70% of the movie is about politics. The movie spends maybe 45-50 min total in the Manhattan Project.The only positive things about the movie is the great cast."
"Movie was released on the 19th in my country. In my opinion, it is the most important film Nolan has ever made. I had goosebumps during THAT part in the middle of the movie and at the end. No viewing experience could have given me that suffocating and colossal feeling than in the cinema. The music score, the cinematography, the acting, everything about it is sublime. I sank in my seat and for a good 5 minutes after it ended, none of the people I watched it with made a move. We just kind of sat there in silence, at a loss for words. See this on the big screens. It's an incredible, haunting piece of art and cinema at its finest.Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt are outstanding in this. The cast was just stellar."
"Profoundly poignant and introspective, ""Oppenheimer"" condenses the critical aspects of one mans life and internal struggles, into a three hour movie, which is challenging to watch. Christopher Nolan is a master at conjuring up wild fantasies, but in ""Oppenheimer"" he needed to stay grounded. He needed to take the works of other writers and treat the story with the respect it deserves. On one hand, the film is a masterpiece, due to how Nolan presents Oppenheimers personal struggle, having invented the means to our own demise. On the other hand, it's a Christopher Nolan movie and his wildly outlandish and incoherent methodology of telling stories, feels like a child's finger painting when looking at the material he has to work with. Its clear there wasn't enough conflict during the rise of Oppenheimer, being the lead scientist at Los Alamos, so Nolan came up with a clever, all be it challenging to understand, method of creating some sort of through narrative which binds the three hours together. For better or worse, as the story unravels, it gets further and further engrossing and by the end, you honestly want more. You'll be hard pressed to find a filmmaker who doesn't smile when the audiences biggest complaint, is a three hour biopic, not being long enough.The film is helmed by quite an incredible all-star cast, with award winning guys doing bit parts like Kenneth Branagh and Rami Malek. Cillian Murphy is so deadpan the entire film, he's so emotionless, even in moments of distress, it's hard to connect with his performance. Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Robert Downy JR, the ""main"" cast of the film, were all much more rounded performances and honestly, steal the show from Cillian unfortunately. Robert clearly wants an Oscar and his performance is worthy. It was a fantastic role for him, one of the best I've seen in years. Blunt is always good and her character is so haunting, she almost feels like a schizophrenic, which is kind of what the real person was like. Of course who can go wrong with Matt Damon, the part was very simple and he did an admirable job. But gosh, poor Cillian, I feel so bad. He had two great opportunities to show some emotion and Nolan clearly felt it didn't work, as they were left on the cutting room floor. Was he the wrong pick? Without seeing his full range on screen, it's hard to tell. I just know without the tremendous supporting cast, mostly award winners in their own right, Cillian would not have been able to hold it, staring at the camera with that deadpan look.To say this film is an ""IMAX"" movie, is disingenuous to the audience. Not only is there basically no major IMAX scenes in the movie, but it takes way from the story. The vast majority of the film is shot with Panavision 5 perf 65mm cameras, which his a widescreen 2.20:1 aspect ratio format. Harkening back to ""The Dark Knight Rises"", which was mostly shot on 35mm Anamorphic. The 2.20:1 aspect ratio IS the aspect ratio the film was edited in and this is what all of the dialog scenes are shot with. So the ""IMAX"" version of the film, jumps between aspect ratio's nearly every scene. There were some pretty full 15P 65mm IMAX shots between the 5 perf scenes, but they were a distraction. The film would have been still awesome as a 2.20:1 aspect ratio film, designed to fill the 1.90:1 aspect ratio ""digital"" IMAX screens. The CLEARLY photochemical timing was poor, reminiscent of Dunkirk, which I thought on film was one of the poorest examples of photochemical timing made in the modern era. Nolans last film ""Tenet"" looked outstanding because it had a DI (digital intermediate) finish, where they scanned the negative, colored it digitally and recoded it back to film. This is the ""normal"" workflow that's been used since the early 2000's for nearly all movies, outside of Christopher Nolan and Paul Thomas Anderson, who both prefer the look of photochemical timing. However, when the timing is poor, the audience complains about the cinematography, which is something I've seen so many people do with Dunkirk and Oppenheimer on their own reviews. Worst yet, was the black and white scenes, printed to color stock. Oh gosh, what an egregious thing to do. Not only were they green, I mean straight green, but they were mostly timed wrong. Either too dark or too bright. There was such an unevenness to the timing over-all, it wasn't nearly the IMAX prints of Dunkirk bad, but it was damn close.Hoyte van Hoytema's work is outstanding in ""Oppenheimer"". The film features a lot of complex dialog scenes and keeping them interesting with framing and blocking, with set design and lighting, was very tricky. Editing played a key role as well, but I always look at what was shot day-of and Hoyte and his crew just nailed it. Where they wanted to be more intimate with the camera, they'd push for wider angle lenses and hand held. When they wanted to be more removed, looking in from a distance, they'd switch to dollies and sticks, with an IMAX shot here or there mixed in for fun. I don't even recall seeing a crane or jib shot in the entire film, it was either hand held, dolly or sticks. You can tell they were shooting fast, lots of complex scenes, which have to evoke emotion, which need to be understood by the viewer. This is where the editing comes in and where I prefaced this review with the finger painting Nolan does with the incoherent story telling methodology, there were A LOT of editing issues with the movie. Scenes that needed to breathe a few frames more, cut off sometimes mid dialog. Major continuity issues with other characters in scenes mouths moving, but not the right dialog coming out. One moment near the end, where a hand full of frames were missing mid shot! Clearly someone who was cutting the negative screwed up. But mid shot? The technical aspects of post, over-all were a bumbling mess sadly. Even Ludwig Göransson's score was unimaginative and completely forgettable, which was a real shame. The audio mix (always a problem in Nolan films), ruins any ability for the audience to enjoy the score. It's always a struggle to hear the dialog to a point where you just want the score shut off.I feel ""Oppenheimer"" is a quandary of a movie. What he wrote, is an excellent piece of cinema. However, once he ""Nolanized"" the finished product, I think it looses much of its power and intimacy. It goes from a character study to a showpiece for the directors reel. Part of the entire point of this film, is the debate of whether Oppenheimer himself should be credited with the Atomic bomb, or is it the people who gave him the money and dropped it on Japan. The film tries so hard to show how Oppenheimer struggled with the very concept of building a civilization ending weapon, that the world would never be the same once it was dropped on Japan. That Oppenheimer was more than just a scientist, but also someone who should be commended for his desire never to see the bomb used. But the film puts too much emphasis onto Christopher Nolan and his unusual story telling method, along with technical issues, which do not plague other filmmakers of this caliber. It's a travesty because all of us Nolan fans (which I am absolutely one) really felt this could be where Christopher Nolan finally is recognized for his work by the academy. He had all the elements, but he blew it, simply because he couldn't be mature enough. He couldn't pull a Quinten Tarantino. He couldn't just make an adult movie. He sure tried, no doubt the material exists to make an award winning film. What I saw however, was a flawed film which was only saved by a phenomenal supporting cast and a final act, which was not only an extremely powerful message, but also reminds us how nuclear proliferation will eventually be our undoing as a society. Some may argue that Oppenheimer is Nolan's greatest work, but I still think the genius of ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"" can't be beat. Oppenheimer will do very well in the box office, it will make up for Tenet's Covid release debacle, but I will struggle with sleep tonight, thinking what could have been.As a side note, I highly recommend NOT seeing this film on 70mm IMAX. Complete waste of time. Watch it on ""standard"" 70mm or 35mm. There are over 100 prints like that in ""normal"" theaters and the experience SHOULD be better, all be it, still green black and white scenes. I'm sure the digital version is not much better with that aspect, but honestly I feel the digital presentation version of the film, maybe the best way to see it.3.5/5."
"This was an amazingly shot movie. Most if not all are practically shot without the use of vfx which I find quite amazing when visualising the thought process of Oppenheimer.I recognised most actors even in small rolls which was quite amazing. Just shows that many actors wanted to be part of this amazing work.Murphy puts in an amazing performance which so far I expect to do put him in contention for an Oscar for the leading actor position. I also suspect RDJ might walk away with a best supporting actor, if not he should definitely be on the nomination list.All the actors did a fantastic job. The cinematography was amazing and the direction.Some people complained about the dialogue, but I could hear everything fine.This film kept me engaged for the entire runtime."
"Like everyone else I was pretty hyped up for Oppenheimer, the latest flick from Christopher Nolan based on the 2005 biography ''American Prometheus'' by Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin. And after watching it, I think it's safe to say it met almost all of my expectations. From a technical perspective, the film is brilliantly well made. The sound design, production design and the breathtaking cinematography are all top notch. On top of that it also has one of the best scores of the year from Ludwig Görranson.Speaking of the performances, Cillian Murphy IS Oppenheimer. His line delivery, acting and chemistry with the other actors felt so real and natural. Not to mention how identical he looks to the real J. Robert Oppenheimer. But the real star is Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss. Aside from the lead actor he gets most of the screentime and boy did he chewed it up. His expressions, line delivery and particularly the third act meltdown are brilliant. The rest of the cast does a pretty good job especially Benny Safdie as Edward Teller. Just like the title the movie primarily focuses on J. Robert Oppenheimer and his role in developing the atomic bomb. The movie gives him a proper structure and development and is fully fleshed out.Even though the film is brilliantly well made with fantastic performances from the cast, I couldn't help but feel like it dragged on. Now I was really invested in the first 2 hours but as the final hour approaches I was starting to somewhat lose my interest. If only it was trimmed a little then it could've been perfect. Another issue I have with the film is that it completely sidelines the female characters ( just like other movies from Nolan ) Kitty Katherine Oppenheimer, played by Emily Blunt and Jean Tatlock, played by Florence Pugh. They are being setup in the beginning and then are almost completely forgotten until the final hour kicks in. Especially Blunt who should've gotten more screentime as she's supposed to play Oppenheimer's mistress. They could've easily explored more about Oppenheimer's personal life as well. This felt like a missed opportunityOverall, Oppenheimer is a brilliantly well crafted film from Christopher Nolan that depicts one of the most eerie, intense, haunting and terrifying events in the history of mankind and is easily one of the best biopics/historical movies of all time. Even though the movie is 3 hours long and might test your patience it is a chilling experience nonetheless. You do not want to miss this."
"Every character well developed and human, not cookie cutter 'cut outs' or stereotyped by race, religion or profession. Attention to detail in every respect IE the images are stunning . Production design , IE sequence of events and the acting and direction could not be better. Oh . . . A script developed by the Film MakeR from . . . A . . . BooK ; in other words good writing. Human drama taken from real life can be more dramatic and interesting than fictional scripts. IMO the film is 1) a stunning achievement and 2) very much worth the three hour length to see it. You won't find yourself saying , 'this movie is too long' as so many are these days. My one warning and criticism is that in some scenes the dialogue is not even intelligible due to so much other sound in the back round. Highly recommended otherwise.And please , as always , remember to ignore the 'one and done' 'reviewers' here."
"Drama thriller at its best very best ; editing and cinematography and all technical aspects of the movie is in greatest standards, character arc and screenplay is fascinating ,brilliance written all over it !Acting master class; that's one word to describe the movie , it will take a lot of space to describe everyone, so am mentioning the ones impressed me most; matt damon is perfect and emily blunt is pretty good and best of Josh Hartnett to me ,Alden Ehrenreich is impressive and Florence Pugh is simply sensational !And Robert Downey Jr ; excellency of acting ,one of his best work till date ! And the man who relived as OPPENHEIMER ; Cillian Murphy is mind-blowing !!!Now lets talk about the MAIN GUYIF A name of a director and his style of making outshine everyone and everything about the movie then his name must be Christopher Nolan !! If you love his cinemas ,you will adore this ! Like he said ""don't try to understand it, just feel it ""yeah just feel the Unparalleled Cinema Experience !!"
"I'm not especially into biopics - the stories are formulaic by nature, and executing the beginning/ending is never easy (which usually means the middle suffers as a result). ""Genius encounters challenges and overcomes"" can only be so interesting. Enter Christopher Nolan, who uses ALL his tricks to make this film something more than just Oppenheimer's life. And it works. The editing, the time jumps, the sense of chaos, the awe-inspiring cinematography...it all adds stakes over and over. The first two hours just rocketed by. By the time they strapped on their goggles, I was somehow on the edge of my seat for a bomb test with a fairly predictable outcome. The third act dragged a bit, but this was still quite a feat. It's not my favorite Nolan film, but it felt like a maybe the fullest expression of his filmmaking. And I'm glad someone is making movies like this."
"I walked out of Oppenheimer satisfied, but with many questions and ears slightly more deaf than when I walked in. I was looing forward to seeing this movie since last year, and could not wait to go and view it. However, there are a couple things that decreased the enjoyment of this movie for me.Firstly, the musical score throughout the movie was more unimpressive than I would've liked. In Interstellar, the musical score is beautiful, captivating, emotional and helps the viewer further build and extend on the emotions they are already feeling. I cannot say the same for this movie. It was WAY too loud, and it wasn't fitting. I felt that the music would be randomly chucked into scenes in an attempt to build on emotion- but there was no emotion to start with so it was completely ineffective. How am I supposed to understand the movie if I cannot hear half of the dialogue?The explosions were fantastic, and Nolan's cinematography was perfect as always. I found that I was more emotional about the beauty of some scenes than the actual story itself. It did lack emotion, but I feel that if I were to sit here and criticize it I would be wrong. It is a very complicated, intricate story and it is extremely hard to incorporate history in an emotional way when there is so much to it. It would've been hard to say the least, especially since a Historical biographical drama such as this one is new to Nolan's style. The ending scene was captivating and perfect.The cast was ridiculously good, and I could not say there was not a moment where I thought the acting quality dipped. A convincing performance from everyone, and I was quite impressed at Robert Downey Jr's performance. He is sure to win an Oscar.I did find that the visual representation of the growing psychological burden that weighed heavily on Oppenheimer was exceptional, with the drumming combined with the shaking background perfectly conveying the detachment and dehumanization that he was experiencing. Also a very relevant movie to what I am currently learning about in History.A long movie, but it definitely needed the time to explain. However, I do agree that there was not much backstory, and that Nolan instead placed us right into the plot. I found myself searching up information after the movie to gain better insight into the characters and their lives.A great watch, it IS worth the 3 hours. Will require a second watch, but overall extremely impressed with Nolan's work."
"I'm a scientist and an engineer, with a healthy respect for history. Surely there could be hardly any fewer more important topics than this movie.But I guess their attempt to show respect to the dead and through the topic seriously, which to be fair is warranted, leads to a truly bleak film.Bleakness, despair, tension is supposed to build and relax, build and relax, you can't just hold it at maximum value for 3 hours.And there's just a mountain of exposition. Hey, I get it, real life is complicated, so if you want to remain true it's hard to make a single theme that wraps up neatly. But this film takes it too far. It includes essentially every single person, and there is far too much emphasis on courtroom drama instead of the scientists. At times, it relies on the audience to be preloaded with all and respect for the events, instead of earning that. The story is just too complicated, unable to go into depth with anything in a headlong rush of minor characters and historical facts.This is really a five-star movie to me. I walked out close to the end when I realized that the film still wasn't close to ending. But it's important topic, so I'll give six stars."
"I am a HUGE Nolan fan. I love his films so you can imagine my excitement to have seen press reviews and booked to see this movie. I avoided trailers cos I wanted to be blown away.But... I was hugely disappointed! And I mean CATACLYSMIICALLY!!Acting is great, no doubt.The score is great, definitely.Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey junior deserve oscar nominations, absolutely!That's it. This film is almost like watching a documentary, that you've committed to (cos you want to learn something, and you like the subject matter) but then get bored halfway through, but still persevere hoping there's a huge payoff for your investment in time.Sorry folks but there really, really isn't. It's very fragmented, jumps around in time far too much..... but you'll still stay until the end in the hope that this Nolan film will blow your mind with some incredible last hour.... and you'll say '""Masterpiece""... but it doesn't.I left the cinema, texted my mate (I'd already arranged to see it in IMAX with him in a few days) and cancelled. Luckily he hadn't bought the tickets cos, even if he had, I'd have sent him the money but not gone. Huuuuge disappointement. For me anyway, and the two people I watched it with. They felt the same.And from what we witnessed, quite a few other people too.Make up your own mind tho.If you enjoy watching senate hearings, or study 20th century American history, then go see it. If you want to see an exciting Nolan movie then stay at home and watch any of his other films.I almost wish I'd have gone and, watched Barbie instead...... almost...."
"So Oppenheimer is undoubtedly one of the most anticipated movies of the year by many people including myself, a Nolan epic people wait for and it delivers, not without some flaws but the types of flaws don't carry nearly as much weight as the positives.Oppenheimer is about a period in J Robert Oppenheimers life, gathering with some of the greatest minds in Physics, Oppenheimer must build a bomb for the US army so they can win world war 2. We get to see his personal life and the struggles of being one of the smartest men alive.I think the pacing for the first 2 hours was great, not a second felt dragged, we are constantly bouncing from one scene to the next, showcasing the internal panic of meeting his deadline and what it must be like being as fast paced within his mind.The score FANTASTIC, the cinematic shots are beautiful and that you expect, there are these shots of atoms and other forces at times when he speaks that we're so great.The supporting cast were all fantastic, so man amazing actors in this, Florence was okay, I found her purpose to the film was okay, her acting was fantastic, Matt Damon was great, showing his development to Opp, Emily blunts character had a nice arc within the movie, RDJ was fantastic and knowing nothing about Opps life made it sweeter as the movie went on, but Cillian was the man of the hour, FINALLY, he was incredible and held the movie on his shoulders, his emotions are great, his assurance and contemplation are fantastic scenes.The 3hr runtime was a little much as the last 40-1hr felt like it lost momentum, I loved the scenes but their pace made me lose the feeling I had for a long while, other than that, I loved it, not sure it I will rush to see it again but it's a fantastic movie, 8.5/10."
"Absolutely brilliant portrayal of, well, everything. The powerful mental battles are the best ever place on screen. The music adds to this experience in a way that has never hit you this hard. And I mean HIT. Physical sound is incredible. Any movies that makes your smart watch tell you to calm down it's worth watching.The sex scenes actually add to the movie but they are not sensual.Try and see this on the largest screen possible. With the loudest sound you can get.The time goes past very fast. It is not a burden. It really does not feel that long. Have a large drink nearby and make sure you empty your bladder."
"Oppenheimer (2023), directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Cillian Murphy in the titular part, is that rare production where everything - everything - works.J. Robert Oppenheimer (called Robert, called 'Oppie', never called Julius) is the central figure of a story that is larger than any person; the heart of which beats at the temperature of approximately 300,000 degrees Celsius; the successful resolution of which threatens to swallow the world. Making a film that doubles as a biography of the atomic bomb and of its 'father' is a tall order, yet Nolan does the subject justice.Covering the expanse of thirty-seven years, from 1926 to 1963, the picture presents a non-linear sequence of events. The narrative moves to and fro between two hearings: that where the matter of Oppenheimer's security clearance is debated; and that where Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) is to be confirmed by the Senate as Secretary of Commerce. The latter plot-line may be unexpected, but it serves to expose the political machinations at work and, ultimately, links Oppenheimer's roles as a scientist and laboratory director to his personal life and his legacy.The performances by Murphy and Downey Jr. Are outstanding, with the rest of the ensemble cast (Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh et al. Et al.) shining in their parts. Damon, in the role of General Leslie Groves, the officer directing the Manhattan Project, provides a welcome foil for Murphy's Oppenheimer, with the two sharing some of the best dialogue in the film. Pugh and Blunt, in the roles of Oppenheimer's lover and wife respectively, are striking and memorable in their own right.The cinematography by Nolan's frequent collaborator Hoyte Van Hoytema effortlessly oscillates between the minute and the colossal. The decision to forego computer-generated special effects - in favour of practical methods and recreation of historical settings - lends the picture authenticity that is rare in the CGI-saturated world of Hollywood blockbusters. The original score composed by Ludwig Göransson is the nerve of the story, skilfully guiding the audience from 'the highest high, to the lowest low'.Oppenheimer is a work of cinematic art. It may deal with one of the darkest chapters in American history, yet its effect is that of profound enlightenment, of an experience surpassing one's immediate life, of an immersion into a world that is supranatural, arranged, distilled, concentrated - yet real. It is best seen at a theatre; perhaps, multiple times at that."
"This film is brilliant. The movie is 3 hours long but it felt more like 2 to 2 and a half hours. It can be a bit overwhelming sometimes, and I definitely recommend to do a bit of research of who Robert. J. Oppenheimer was. It's also a film that you need to pay really close attention to, you could easily miss something. The audio is perfect and I didn't have any problems with hearing the voices of the characters, I watched this in IMAX by the way and I definitely recommend the reader to also watch it in this format. You can't expect action from this movie because if you do you will be disappointed, the film contains mostly scenes of the person's talking, but Nolan manages to even let scenes like this feel thrilling. The acting performance is magnificent, probably the best of 2023, Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey jr. Were brilliant. The visuals were also very impressive considering the fact that they didn't use any CGI this whole movie. The fact is that this film is objectively good even though I'm not a film expert of any sorts, and I definitely recommend to watch it (In IMAX if possible)."
I walked out of the cinema in complete awe. The movie had some of the best and most bone chilling cinematography and audio I have ever witnessed. The IMAX experience was out of this world and Christopher Nolan's choice to spend all the time and resources to film in this format was the best decision he possibly could've made. The sound and size of the picture gave it a magnitude like no other. The acting was phenomenal and Cillain Murphy's performance was out of this world. Not a single person in the world that could play the role any better. This movie is a work of art and a definitive Oscar and award winning masterpiece. Easy ten stars.
"This has to be experienced in a cinema with high quality sound system. The sound plays a crucial role in the experience of watching this non-stop high paced movie. The movie is 3 hours long but did not feel like it, in fact I was surprised when it finished. It is a classic hit and keeps you on the edge of your sit. I would give the movie itself 9/10 but because of the amazing visuals plus sound editing, the cinematic experience elevates it so gets a rare 10/10 for me. The acting is superb. Murphy and RDJ give monstrous performances. If indeed Nolan is planning on making biographies, I am really looking forward to watching them because this was the best Nolan movie so far, well The dark knight has a special place in my heart but this was an intense experience for sure."
"Oppenheimer is a captivating masterpiece that skillfully combines drama, history, and humanity. With stunning cinematography, powerful performances, exceptional score and sound design, and thought-provoking storytelling, it immerses viewers in the complex world of J. Robert Oppenheimer. The film explores his personal journey, from leading the Manhattan Project to grappling with the moral implications of his scientific breakthrough. It raises profound questions about the consequences of scientific progress and serves as a reminder of the ethical dilemmas that accompany it. A must-watch for those intrigued by science, history, and the human experience."
"This was my most anticipated film of the year, as a fan of Nolan's previous films. After what, in my opinion, was a bit of a miss with Tenet, I was eager to see how Nolan's next film would turn out, and if it would be a return to form or a convoluted and overstuffed picture. I am very pleased to say I found Oppenheimer to be very much a return to form for Nolan, up there with his best work such as Inception, Interstellar, the Dark Knight, Memento and the Prestige. Everyone plays their parts very well, and along with a crisp, entertaining and intriguing screenplay and score, the film surges to great heights.Compared to the mind-bending enthralling dreamscapes of Inception, or the majestic and expansive reaches of space in Interstellar, Oppenheimer is focused on the much less fantastical, but no less significant, real life figures in a race to harness the power of the atom to win the Second World War. At the center of this struggle is J Robert Oppenheimer, a complex and brilliant individual whose nuance and inner turmoil is captured perfectly in a tour de force performance by Cillain Murphy, a frequent Christopher Nolan collaborator. Murphy does a brilliant job portraying Oppenheimer from his early graduate school days at Cambridge through to Gottingen and then his establishment of the quantum physics program at Berkeley, his collaborations with Ernest Lawrence, friendship with Isidor Rabi, on again off again fling with the erratic Jean Tatlock and his meeting with his future wife Kitty. The film starts in the middle of things with Oppenheimer's early studies through to his recruitment into the Manhattan project, and then his eventual success with the development of an atomic weapon that forever changed the history of the war and the world. The interspersed glimpses of the quantum realm and atoms was a nice visual accompaniment in my view. Nolan deftly cuts between the colored subjective view of Oppenheimer and the black and white perspective of his opponent, the calculating and crafty Lewis Strauss (played superbly with menace by Robert Downey).The film captures its source material well, using the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin as its basis. We see Oppenheimer reach the pinnacle of his scientific career, being on the cover of time magazine, meeting President Truman and achieving a remarkable success in developing the nuclear gadget that ended the war. He wins rightfully deserved accolades, but is haunted by the carnage, suffering and loss his creation brings about. He begins to speak out against the proliferation of nuclear weapons to avert a greater tragedy, but sadly it is too late. As they say, pride comes before the fall, and as Prometheus was punished for giving fire to humanity, so to was the American Prometheus brought low after his great triumph. We see the insidious plan of Strauss put into motion, driven by his belief that Oppenheimer poisoned other scientists against him. Part of the hearing against Oppenheimer's criticism was indeed his opposition to further nuclear proliferation and the development of even more destructive weapons. Strauss's plot leads to the discrediting and erasure of Oppenheimers credibility until he loses his security clearance and is essentially forced out of government work, his reputation in ruins.All in all, the film is an engaging and carefully crafted look into one of the most significant men in history, whose work forever changed not just the face of war, but the world itself. While he achieved tremendous personal and professional success and reached the pinnacle of his career, he was tormented by the destruction he had unleashed with his work and began to show remorse for what he had wrought. The film does a great job in laying out Oppenheimer's character, both virtues and flaws and leaving it to the viewer to judge who he was as a person.The only complaints I have with the film are that it drags a bit at the end. This is the longest of Nolan's films at a shade over three hours, and while the pacing is for the most part great, the beginning and end of the film do seem a bit quick and dragged out, respectively. The inclusion of a few sex scenes that seemed out of place and bizarre was my other gripe. These were perhaps meant to indicate Oppenheimer's vulnerability and mistakes, but I felt they were unnecessary and gratuitous. In short, I think the film was, for the most part, an excellent and compelling portrayal of one of history's most fascinating individuals."
"Obviously, this is a massive undertaking, not as much as building the bomb but to juggle all these characters and motivations and make it coherent is overwhelming. That said, this needed some serious, serious cutting. Nolan gives way too much time to the loss of Oppenheimer's security clearance at the end. It does not carry the same weight as the mental and emotional struggle to build the bomb. Nolan beats us senseless in the last third by having these long, boring sessions where Oppenheimer and his witness are verbally assaulted during his security hearing. Who cares? 226,000 people were killed by the bomb and the scenes afterwards have to do with his security clearance and accusations of communist sympathies? Yeah, ok, that's important to Oppenheimer but I was praying for it to end quickly. Nolan went off the rails at the end. That last third was just ok. Could have cut a lot of repetitive information that just doesn't mean squat."
"Ocean's Eleven, but with scientists. Perhaps Nolan even included the line 'I am assembling a team' as a very suave, subtle reference to the heist genre... my god the man is a genius.Starts out with protagonist suffering from PC screensaver visions which are discarded after the first 15 minutes of the movie. This was clearly meant to prove the supreme profundity of the main character.Entire movie is disjointed, moves far too quickly for the characters or their relationships to properly develop for the viewer. BAM! Another A-list actor! BAM! Another one. BAM! BAM!Are you impressed yet?Einstein figures as a sort of fairy god mother. Very tropey.I have the feeling that Nolan was going for some Usual Suspects vibe at the end with the twist of the character of Robert Downey Jr. Being 'ze bad man'. Sorry, but it was convoluted, overly long and emotionally unpersuasive. Bureaucratic procedures are very hard to make exciting - and I am a lawyer.However, Cillian nails Oppenheimer. One just has to watch interviews with the man. The cadence of speech, voice, posture. Well done. But: not utilized fully. All Murphy is asked to do is stare with wet eyes into the camera, in autistic reverie or horror.Seriously, in my opinion, only one single scene was captivating, which was the one where Oppenheimer was interviewed by Colonel Commiehunter. If the entire movie tried to capture the atmosphere of that single scene, we would have had a fantastic film.Ending was such an overly dramatic nothing whaffle.Worst Nolan movie i have seen - this was the first one where about halfway, I wanted it to end."
"This film is pure cinema. Its the perfect combination of brillant story telling and outstanding performances. Its not just about the making of bomb. Its more about the politics that played around it. Some of the shots are so brilliant that you feel like you are actually in the film and it feels like it should never end. Looking at the reviews from everyother platform, you might as well know about the performance of Cillian Murphy. No doubt its one of the best character display I have ever seen, but for me the impact which Robert Downey Junior makes, is worth a special mention. Overall the movie is a great experience and if you wish to watch it, watch it only in IMAX. You will not regret it."
As a fan of both Cillian and Nolan sir ..this films brings the joy of watching a super grand historic saga in the cinema halls ... Oppenheimer has made me travel 250 kms for IMAX ...as i know if i miss this i will not be able to forgive myself .. This film not only makes u at the edge of the seat knowing all the outcomes but also makes ur ears focussed on the exceptional dialogues and bg score . Not forgetting the performance given by RDJ ..he has given one of the best performances in his career ...This film is not only a treat to watch but also shows how The Great Robert Oppenheimer was cheated by his own countrie's pitty politics .. People are saying this is a long movie but watching it never made me feel about the duration of this masterpiece.... and is one of the best casting made for each and every role ...I am sure about watching it again 😍
"I will keep it brief.Ignore all the haters that has given lower than a 7 star review. As I read some of their reviews it seems that they haven't even seen the movie. They are either judging ""the book by it's cover"" or they are intentionally review bombing the movie. I mean let's be real, who can believe a 1-star review for a movie that has the most amazing cast and written and directed by the most prestigious filmmaker of our time.It's a masterpiece. Amazing acting, cinematography and sound design. Definitely expecting 5-6 oscar nominations.I promise you will be left shaken with your heart in your throat.It's a must watch. Watch it on iMAX in its intended format."
"Just walking out of the theatre after watching the double feature #Barbenheimer. The two-hour movie was awful. AWFUL! I'm so glad I got to see that one first because the three-hour movie...aka Oppenheimer...was genius. Absolutely phenomenal. I will have to see it again to clear up in my mind which guys was which scientist. Einstein (obvious, of course) was a glorious character (as he was in real life), so I thoroughly enjoyed Tom Conti's portrayal of him. I am a huge fan of Matthew Modine - what a gift to see him on the big screen again. Gary Oldman is unreal (and unrecognizable) as Truman. Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., and Downey's (Strauss') advisor (don't know who the actor is) steal the last 25 minutes of the show. Wonderful work all around!"
"Oppenheimer is a mesmerizing film from start to finish. Superbly directed and cut the movie makes sense of a complicated American genius. From its visceral sound track and visuals to the tremendous acting of Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. The three hour run time flys by. The cast is a veritable who's who of great actors. Emily Blunt is also astonishing as Kitty Oppenheimer.The many contradictions in Oppenheimer's life fits so well with Nolan's directorial style. There is movement in time, but not to be distracting. The movie peaks with The Trinity test, but then has a gut wrenching final act showing the destruction of Oppenheimer at the hands of small men with petty agendas and motives. The path from the peak of triumph at building the bomb and ending the war to the depths of Oppenheimer losing his clearance is gut wrenching.I highly recommend this movie. See it in IMAX."
"It is a very great movie in all respects. I watched it on the imax screen. It was something dazzling throughout the 3 hours. I did not feel bored or look at the clock at all. The acting was very beautiful and also, for sure, the directing was very great. The dialogues that were present throughout the film were beautiful and had a strong meaning and presence in the story. It is not present in vain. I expect that I will watch it in the cinema more than once during this period. It is one of the most beautiful works that I have seen during the past two years and deservedly deserves the Oscar in many aspects."
"I have given it 8 out of 10 because it held my attention and was pretty good. But some things really annoyed me about it.Nolan has a problem with pace. Everything is unrelentingly frenetic. He seems afraid of the quiet and the slow. He doesn't do lingering shots like Tarkovsky. When characters decide to have important conversations, they walk quickly in large groups through corridors accompanied by loud intrusive music so we can't overhear them. Even when Oppy merely thinks about particles, we are assaulted by phantasmagorical images and loud unpleasant noises.The centrepiece of the film, the detonation of the first atomic bomb, is surprisingly unconvincing and underwhelming. Nolan apparently doesn't like CGI but he should have used it here. Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not depicted. A shame. I wanted to see spectacular nuclear explosions.I don't think Cillian Murphy is as good in his role as some people are saying. He can't convey the depth and breadth of Oppenheimer's intelligence. He looks good when he puts Oppenheimer's hat on but any actor would. I felt he was outshone by Robert Downey Jr. Which slightly unbalanced the film in my view. This film should have at its heart the question of the morality of nuclear weapons. But Downey Jr is so good he makes it seem like the film is all about the petty grudges of a long-forgotten politician.Tom Conti is preposterous as Albert Einstein. Conti always thinks that if he chuckles away to himself, we will be fooled into thinking he's a great actor.And Nolan's non-linear narrative habit seems incurable now."
"Oppenheimer was by far the movie I looked forward to the most this year. To see a Christopher Nolan film is to know that you are going to find a story that plays with its timelines, with deep and complex characters and a dense environment, among other things. Well, this time, Nolan lives up to his standards and delivers us a full-blown movie. However, as much as I hate to see a movie with expectations, whether good or bad, it seems to me that despite all the hype surrounding Oppenheimer, the movie falls short in some key elements.But first, let's highlight the good. The screenplay should always be the highlight in these films, but in this case so is the cinematography, sound editing, and soundtrack. Elements that greatly increase the quality of a film if they are well used from a new perspective for the cinema itself.The performances are very good, by experienced and recognized actors, although Nolan's supervising hand is also evident.The production design couldn't be bad for the film's budget, but let's also not forget the excellent practical effects used for the explosions and other details. Cinema made in the old school, with a renewed and modern vision, like that of the master Nolan.Now... let's get into what I didn't like.Starting with the big elephant in the room. The fashionable elephant in today's cinema. Why does it take 3 hours of film to show a biopic that could have been a 2 hour film? I had to say it.Now, the deeper problem is not that. The film shows a clear 3-part structure. A clearly divided story that, despite the fact that it's constantly interconnected with its time lines, wants to play at being a conventional movie, but it can't. This can be good and bad at the same time. Its climax is located at a rather weird point and the third act doesn't really feel like it. In the end it turns into an endless drama, with characters that stop being interesting, in an outcome that, although it is not predictable, is quite flat and boring.Finally, the last negative point would be the lack of scenes that prove the ""success"" of the bomb, which explodes only in the mind of the protagonist in a very interesting way, considering that in many points we're seeing the story from inside the mind from Oppenheimer himself.To close, this work is unmissable, it'll be widely remembered, and technically it's pure gold, but it isn't one of the films that I'd see again."
"Rating: 6.9I thought this was going to be better than what it was. It was a finely crafted movie, the presentation was phenomenal, the message was potent and Cillian Murphy carries as Oppenheimer, but I found some of the intricacies a little hard to follow and unfortunately boring. A lot of the dialogue especially in the second act was just laying out the bureaucracy of building a bomb which isn't entertaining; security clearances, compartmentalization, acquiring personnel, etc. There are a lot of characters in this movie many aren't on screen long enough for me to fully understand their role in the narrative which leads to confusion for those who aren't history buffs. If you know the history this movie will probably fare better, but the real highlight was the visual imagery that conveys Oppenheimer's mental state, and the detonation itself. I'm not sure why in the beginning Oppenheimer was having nightmares and visions of quantum physics (at that point he hadn't built the bomb yet and shouldn't be suffering from any PTSD), but I might've missed something. As a whole an quickly paced slightly boring watch."
"My son just described Oppenheimer as one hour of physics, one hour of building a bomb, and one hour of courtroom drama. That it is, but he neglected to mention that it's a full 181 minutes of bum-numbing Oscar-bait that will be a test of patience for all but dedicated Nolanites (or nuclear physicists, but I don't think there were many of those at the screening I attended).I don't care how urgent and emotional the music gets, it's still people talking about quantum mechanics, communism and legal stuff that I didn't quite understand. It's not exactly a fun watch, nor a particularly profound one: we all know that the creation of atomic bombs ended WWII but ushered in an age of nuclear threat that still hangs over us today. I think most sane people would happily put the genie back in the bottle if they could. The film says nothing new - it merely emphasises how most of us feel about war, and nuclear weapons in general. Nolan could have done that in a lot less time, but the film wouldn't feel as important then, would it?The performances are undeniably good, with Murphy putting in a strong turn as the titular scientist, Nolan delivers some fairly impressive visuals (although the long awaited detonation of the test bomb is underwhelming - I doubt seeing it in IMAX would have helped), and I now know what Florence Pugh looks like naked (now that I would liked to have seen in IMAX!), but I feel that mankind needs a three hour biopic about J. Robert Oppenheimer about as much as it needs a destructive force capable of destroying the planet many times over.3/10. It's like Oliver Stone's JFK for science nerds - long, boring, and destined to win awards (they'll give an Oscar to any old tripe these days - **cough** Everything, Everywhere All At Once **cough**)."
"POSITIVES:1) Cillian Murphy is absolutely spellbinding. He carries the whole film on his back and plays Oppenheimer during so many different parts of his life, yet he never for a second seems to falter in any way. He should be guaranteed a Best Actor nomination. I also think Robert Downey Jr should be guaranteed a Best Supporting Actor nomination
2) This almost goes without saying for Nolan, but the film has been made unbelievably well. It looks like a painting during so many sequences and I loved the way in which the changing of timeframes and the changing of colour was used
3) The score and the sound design were both incredible. Incredible. The score had me feeling so engaged and literally gripping my seat, whilst the sound design of the explosions made me feel like the cinema was going to take off
4) The moral / philosophical questions at the heart of the film are really thought provoking. I also think this is helped by the fact that none of the characters are perfect, they're all very flawed which makes them all incredibly interestingNEGATIVES:1) There are too many side characters, most of whom aren't really given any backstory or time to shine, so it ends up being very difficult to remember exactly who is who
2) There is a scene near the end where it shows all the characters in their old age, and I thought the old age makeup looked bad and it took me out of the scene."
"Christopher Nolan has delivered yet another cinematic masterpiece with this dark, poignant and powerful biopic of deeply flawed yet brilliant mind. Using Kai Bird's book ""American Prometheus"" as a platform, Nolan leaves the audience contemplating Robert's motivation as an American icon or Anti hero.As J. Robert Oppenheimer and his contemporaries are questioned in relation to his loyalty to his country and Soviet communist ties, we are transported to the turmoil of the professional and private life of Oppenheimer and the mind that would change the world.There are standout performances everywhere, most notably Robert Downey Jnr and of course Cillian Murphy, who could be knocking the door on an oscar nod. Using no CGI also adds to the films authenticity. This is just one of those cinematic moments despite it's length, is simply brilliant."
"""Openheimer"" is an ambitious and intellectually stimulating cinematic masterpiece that delves into the life of one of the most enigmatic and controversial figures of the 20th century - J. Robert Oppenheimer. Directed by auteur visionary, the film skillfully transports the audience into the complex world of nuclear physics, politics, and the moral dilemmas that surrounded the development of the atomic bomb during World War II.Set against the backdrop of the tumultuous years leading up to and during World War II, ""Openheimer"" follows the life and career of J. Robert Oppenheimer, played impeccably by an A-list actor who brings the character to life with authenticity and depth. The film begins with Oppenheimer's early days as a brilliant physicist and his ascent to prominence in the academic world. The narrative takes its time to explore his interactions with fellow scientists, his dedication to scientific exploration, and his internal struggle with the profound implications of his research.What sets ""Openheimer"" apart from conventional biographical dramas is its unflinching honesty in depicting Oppenheimer's flaws and moral dilemmas. The film does not shy away from showing the toll his involvement in the Manhattan Project took on his conscience. The screenplay beautifully weaves in personal moments, including his complex relationships with family and lovers, which add a human touch to the story and make Oppenheimer a more relatable and multidimensional character.The film's cinematography is breathtaking, capturing both the grandeur of scientific exploration and the darkness of ethical quandaries. The recreation of the Manhattan Project and the creation of the atomic bomb is truly remarkable, transporting the audience to that critical juncture in history. The visual effects, accompanied by a hauntingly evocative score, heighten the emotional impact of the film, leaving viewers pondering the grave consequences of scientific advancement.""Openheimer"" skillfully explores the wider social and political context of the time, offering a nuanced understanding of the motivations and pressures that shaped Oppenheimer's actions. It raises important questions about the ethical responsibility of scientists and the immense power they hold in shaping the course of history.The supporting cast deserves special mention for their remarkable performances, bringing life to the supporting characters and adding depth to the narrative. The film's pacing, though deliberate, may test the patience of some viewers who prefer a faster tempo. However, those who are willing to invest themselves in the film's intellectual and emotional journey will be rewarded with a thought-provoking experience.In conclusion, ""Openheimer"" is a captivating and thought-provoking film that successfully balances scientific exploration, personal drama, and moral contemplation. With stellar performances, brilliant cinematography, and an engaging narrative, it offers an immersive cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll. It serves as a reminder of the importance of understanding history's dark secrets and the consequences of our actions, urging us to reflect on the legacy we leave behind."
"Nolan's newest film is both well-acted and well shot. I believe those are the movie's best aspects so I'll get to why I don't think it stands out among his best films. Though there is nothing wrong with dialogue carrying the plot, film is still meant to be a visual medium. When I found out that this film was based on a book, ""American Prometheus"", I was not shocked. This film just went too far with the dialogue and I feel like they didn't have to add every element from the novel into this movie. It just made it too long and too hard to follow. Again, well-acted with a fantastic cast and the social and political commentary was brilliant, but I felt it went too far with the back-and-forth between characters."
"Writing this right after leaving the theater, I am absolutely awestruck at the masterpiece I just witnessed. A brilliant and fast paced movie throughout, this movie truly showcases just how good of a writer Nolan is. No other Nolan movie features this much dialogue and reminded me that Nolan's writing is often overshadowed by his directing skills. That being said, I do believe this film features his greatest directing ever. The acting was superb as Cillian Murphy turns in his best performance yet and was able to shine in nearly every scene of this 3 hour epic. The whole supporting cast was great with wonderful cameos all throughout, but I believe Robert Downey Jr. Deserves praise especially. The score perfectly encapsulates the intense nature of the film and even the sound mixing was spot on as my theater was genuinely shaking. The cinematography even rivals that of other impressive Nolan pictures such as Interstellar. This movie was very dense despite being 3 hours long and was truly the fastest 3 hours has ever felt as I still wanted more. This movie is thrilling throughout and will never leave you bored. Being a Nolan film, expect timelines to jump from one point to the next, but I think the way this was edited is truly his best work. I want to take more time to determine where this will fall on my rankings of Nolan's movies but already I know it's top 3. Any Nolan fan knows that being in the top 3 for this list means it is brilliant given the stiff competition. To see this film, myself and a few other Nolan fans were incredibly hyped for this movie for over a year and even drove an hour and a half away to see this movie on an IMAX screen. I now understand why it was so important to witness this spectacle as such because I have never felt more immersed in a movie before. Without a doubt a masterpiece and a perfect 10/10, do yourself a favor and find the biggest screen possible and let yourself be blown away from start to finish. This is Nolan at his finest."
"If you're going in expecting an action heavy film filled with explosions, then this probably isnt for you. The film is centered around a trial against Oppenheimer and is mostly told through flashbacks. One through the biased POV of Strauss (Robert Downey Jr) and through Oppenheimer himself (Cillian Murphy). The film is long - and also feels very long. So you definitely have to be in the right mindset to sit down and watch. But I really enjoyed watching this exploration of this man and his psyche. The film poses a lot of questions about whether one should have this power. And it actually made me want to read a biography about him.There was headlines before the film came out about the sex scenes. Florence is topless but otherwise nothing else is explicitly shown. There is one scene where they are both sitting naked across from each other that felt unnecessary, mainly as it just felt random, that they could have cut out. But otherwise, kind of tame. I don't know why it was hyped up as much it was.The film also has a ton of cameos. Almost to the point where it becomes a bit distracting. And not all of them are necessary. Does Jack Quaid really do anything in this movie for instance? But none of them are bad. Definitely Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr and Emily Blunt are the highlights of the film though and would also be deserving of Oscar nominations.One of the best films of the year."
"""Wow"" - My exact sentiment as soon as the credits rolled. Nolan is truly a master film maker, this movie truly was an experience to be had only in the cinema.Oppenheimer really is a biopic, and anyone expecting a war movie or some kind of action packed film is sorely mistaken. This is an insight into the incredible mind of a man tasked with a truly ardous dilemma or life and death.It's easy on the eyes, food for thought and no doubt will be hailed as a timeless classic. Cillian is so brilliant in this role, I couldn't praise him any higher, he deserves an award for this portrayal, easily.For a 3 hour long movie, it was fast paced and at no point was I bored."
"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.Perfect experience."
"Too many characters, facts and layers of stories that you develop anxieties watching as to be hopeful not to missed any details so that might make the whole movie incomprehensible. Great cast, not so interesting cinematic experience totally not worth IMAX tickets.I think Nolan should focus on sci fi movies and things that he can do as he pleased and not bounded by facts. Its a real pleasure to watch interstellar and inceptions that I have certain expectations on his movies but Oppenheimer and Dunkirk proved that he might not be up to a legendary director level for biographical movies and fact / history."
"I disagree with what others have said about the technical aspects of the film. I thought the cinematography was so-so and the sound and musical score were awful. There were many times I had to read lips because some annoying background music or rumbling sound or just plain noise grew so loud that the dialog could not be heard. It wasn't even there to evoke emotions like anticipation or fear; it was just noise. And visually, how hard do you need to try to screw up the film of a nuclear explosion? It kind of looked like an overloaded barbecue grill it was so bad.Content wise, I just couldn't get invested in the story or the characters. The director and screenwriter need to go the extra mile to tell a story that the viewers already know, but slicing that story into a million cuts isn't the way to go. While I agree with other reviews that say the storytelling is too nonlinear and requires too much attention for three hours, that, per se, wouldn't have bothered me if I had been engrossed in the story, but I never reached the level of investment where the three hours would slip by quickly. I partially blame bad editing. It was almost as if my mind wanted to live through the movie in a dream-like state, but the editor kept waking me up every minute or so. I ended up checking my watch a few times."
"(9.7) A near perfect film and easily one of the best films I've ever seen. The cast is amazing and each actor performs like they never have before, particularly Murphy and Downey. The tone of the film transforms with the plot throughtout and the movie is plauged with themes of guilt that are expertly shown through Nolan's Directing and Cillian's acting. Towards the second half of the film the directing almost has a kind of aspect of horror. The film might be 3 hours but it does not drag at all and it leaves you wanting more by the end. The best scene is the scene containing the detonation of the atomic bomb."
"Fantastic acting from top to bottom from a really good cast (Robert Downey Jr is all but unrecognizable, really great to see him lose himself in a role again). It's a compelling story. I can't claim to know anything about Robert Oppenheimer besides the history headlines, but it appears he was much more complex than the headlines would indicate. My only real complaint about this film is the score. I tend to love the scores of no Nolan's films, but this one is overbearing. It's too loud and intrudes on too many scenes. It's nearly constant, and that winds up detracting from the impact of some of the scenes, which, given how dramatic the score is, is exactly the opposite of what's intended. I found it pretty distracting, and a significant miscalculation. Nonetheless, this is one of those movies that everyone really ought to see. Side note about the story. I didn't really go into this knowing what to expect, but a significant part of the story and the plot center on the politics around the Manhattan Project during and after. This aspect of the movie for me was the most compelling part of it, in addition to oppenheimer's own grappling with the magnitude of what he had contributed to."
"This is, by far, the most important film of the 21st century. It should win every category. This film is not about the bomb per say. It is about F. Robert Oppenheimer and his grave sin.*Spoilers ahead, skip to end* -I went into this movie expecting a race towards the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the way it affected the world around us, and the effect it had on Roberts life. What I did not expect was a full deep dive into the life of Oppenheimer and the thrilling ladder half of this film. You can physically feel the emotion that is conveyed in Cillian's Oscar-worthy performance. There was not a scene that I felt deeply connected to the protagonist and his efforts, including his unbearable shame and regret. The supporting cast does an outstanding job as well. Most of the supporting cast are capable of a lead role themselves, let alone absolutely killing their 20 minutes screen time in this 3 hour long spectacle. Allegedly, RDJ believed his role as 'Iron Man' would stunt this performance, as he would behave more like Tony Stark. I did not even recognize him until the 1.5 hour mark when his character became agitated. His performance was immaculate. The ending is not necessarily happy, as it ends with a conversation the audience was aware of but did not ever hear. This spine chilling conversation ended with Oppenheimer staring into a pond with grim, thrilling music with a very slow zoom in on Roberts face. The entire movie is a work of art, and the ending left me uneasy, yet satisfied.*End of spoilers*10/10. Christopher Nolan once again proving he is one of the greatest directors of all time. Best movie I have seen in years."
"Mr Nolan at his best. Just WoW.Performance of Cillian Murphy & Robert Downey JR is just outstanding.The conflict of Oppenheimer's Life as shown is completely apt for such an important person, May be the most important person of that time...
The visuals of TRINITY TEST just blown me away... the work of NOLAN there just shows why as a director he'll be remembered for all along the time...
Overall a masterpiece.. completely satisfied ..
The dialogue ' I AM BECOME THE DEATH, THE DESTROYER OF THE WORLD ' just shows the POV of Oppenheimer himself... What he thought about it was clearly shown in the film.. loved it completely...."
"Usually, the films of Christopher Nolan traffic in mind-bending (often time-bending) science fiction or fantasy. ""Oppenheimer"" is a clear departure from that type of movie, but proves to be just as landmark of an achievement in biopics provided one views it as such.For a very basic overview, Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" tells the story of the famed quantum physicist Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) who would go on to create the first atomic weapon. While his work at Los Alamos certainly comprises large swaths of this picture, Oppenheimer is also examined as a young free-thinker (maybe ""Communist""?) as well as his post-WWII scrutiny when his views on atomic warfare changed radically (away from hawk and towards dove).The biggest consideration one must make in evaluating ""Oppenheimer"" is simply to understand that it is a true biopic. This isn't the story of the Manhattan Project, nor is it a World War 2-centric tale. The film's title is an accurate representation of the subject matter, to be sure. Viewed through this prism, the film's final act (which has been the sticking point for some viewers) plays a lot better.Besides clearly capturing the Oppenheimer persona and visage, the hallmark of Nolan's work here is examining the shades of gray in that monumental figure's life. Viewers who want to definitively see Oppenheimer as ""one thing or the other"" will be challenged, as this biopic revels in the ""middle ground"", so to speak. How can a man support Communist/Fascist causes and create the most destructive weapon of all-time for a capitalist government? How can a man be so brilliant in scientific principles but also so naive when it comes to basic life assumptions? How can the creator of such destruction turn away from nuclear proliferation and towards arms treaties? Finally, how can a government so thoroughly use a man of such prodigious talent and then immediately smear him when his values don't line up with ""the state"" any longer? Not only are these complex issues compelling through Nolan's specific Oppenheimer lens, but they ring as true today as they ever did in that man's life and times.Of course, ""Oppenheimer"" doesn't lack any of the Nolan panache. It is expertly shot by Hoyte van Hoytema, the score (Ludwig Goransson) is pulse-pounding yet subtle when needed, and Murphy is riveting as the lead. Being surrounded by the likes of Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Josh Hartnett, and Florence Pugh (plus an endgame cameo from a Nolan film acolyte) doesn't hurt, either.I'm almost a week out from seeing ""Oppenheimer"" and I'm still digesting exactly what I saw. I've settled on 9/10 stars for now, but feel that once I read the book it is based on and watch it again it may reach 10/10 status.So, by all means come for the ""big boom"" and the super-secret weapons project stuff--that's all edge-of-your-seat compelling. But also realize that Oppenheimer the man/figure is the true focus of Nolan's creative vision here--not superheroes, time-travelers, magicians, or dreamscapes. Armed with that understanding, ""Oppenheimer"" stands out nearly as much as those other works in its own unique way."
"This movie is the most intense movie i have seen in a theatre. The whole 3 hours felt so intense. Even the interrogation scenes were near perfect dialogues. I didn't felt a single scene was forced or amateurish. Coming to acting, Cilian Murphy delivers his career best performance, and Matt Damon was extraordinary and Robert Downey might have given his best acting till date. Even without a single fight scenes, Nolan has made this more interesting than most of superhero movies. I think the dialogues deserve extra credit. Reminds me of watching 'The godfather' movie which had perfect dialogues. Definitely this one tops Dunkirk and Tenet, but I can't really compare this with Interstellar, prestige and inception, because of difference in genre.The best movie in last few years!Cinematography-10/10
Background score-10/10
Acting-9.8/10
Length-8/10."
"Before going to see Oppenheimer I would strongly advise looking up some background information on Oppenheimer's life beforehand. This film is not interested in hand holding or dumbing information down, nor is it interested in relaxing its pace so that those without at least some prior knowledge of the subject can catch up. This film moves at a cracking pace, effortlessly blending different time lines and events in a brilliantly crafted story that contains some of the best acting I've seen since Sir Anthony Hopkins took home the Oscar for The Father. Cillian Murphy is almost transcendental as J Robert Oppenheimer, so far does her disappear into the character. The rest of the cast is entirely on point as well, the cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking at points, and the soundscape is incredible. I kept waiting for the point where I'd feel as if I was watching a 3 hour film, and it never came, that is how engaged I felt with this movie.10/10 without hesitation. What a fantastic cinema experience this was.(Viewed in 70mm film print with DTS sound)"
"Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest directors working today. Whenever his name is attached to a film, it always brings people to cinemas. I was a bit apprehensive at first with Oppenheimer since Tenet was underwhelming and since it was a biopic, something you would think Nolan wouldn't do. Yet he did and he pulled it off in spectacular fashion.Oppenheimer is a powerful exploration of the father of the atomic bomb, exploring his life, his work and how he viewed the world. This is all brought life by a powerful script and break neck pacing that keeps you engaged all the way to the end. This film was the shortest three hours of my life.The cinematography is outstanding, constantly immersing the audience into Oppenheimer's mind and is complimented by a sublime soundtrack. The sound design is also immaculate and the attention to detail in the physics is excellent. The visuals are outstanding and it amazes me that it was all practical which makes it all the more impressive. All these aspects combine to make a bleak, doomsday-like movie which asks multiple moral questions of the audience but also allows the audience to interpret it in their own way.But the greatest aspect of this film is the performances. Cilian Murphy is absolutely excellent as Oppenheimer, expertly portraying a confident and charismatic scientist eventually becoming a disillusioned and guilt-ridden figure. He is the centre-piece of this film and deserves all the praise. The supporting cast is stacked but a particular mention must go to Robert Downey Jr who delivers a brilliant performance as Lewis Strauss, arguably the strongest of his career. All the cast give it their all.In conclusion, Oppenheimer stands as one of Nolan's best works and arguably his best film since Inception. It is thrilling, poignant and expertly made. A must-watch for all and one I look forward to re-watching countless times."
The casting is phenomenal. A lot of people will go just on that basis. Sadly that's the only phenomenal element to the movie. The movie jumps around oddly without creating satisfying tales. There are missed opportunities to create and impact the real scale of the subject matter. This was a pivotal moment in human history but feels almost unremarkable because of how it was told here.Easily l have been 30 mins shorter and cut some of the characters to focus the narrative better. Florence Pugh (thesp darling) was solid & her character got a lot of time (relatively) but felt minor to overall arc and Emily Blunt was excellent but her influence was largely ignored. Some of the scientists where barely mentioned then had major roles to play.Nolan had chance to smash it. Everything was there for him. He dropped the ball (or bomb if you like) and it's just simply a shame. Ah well.
"There was only 2 moments i can remember after watching the whole movie. When the 1st atomic bomb is tested and the whole movie goes quite and you only hear the small noises, no dialogue nothing then the shockwave hits and my god it sounded amazing i was so happy when that happened and mind you if happened after 30 minutes of slow pacing boring starting. I couldn't focus on the movie what so ever cause the story telling was so random that sometimes it shows the current event, goes back to the past, goes even past when oppenhimer was young lad in collage. I was just left confused. I wanted to walk out during the whole movie. Sorry but cillian murphy was the only good thing about the movie."
"""Oppenheimer"" is a magnum opus that showcases Christopher Nolan's brilliance as a filmmaker. Spanning four decades of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life, the film masterfully weaves a scrambled chronology, captivating audiences with its absorbing narrative. Cillian Murphy delivers a mesmerizing performance, embodying Oppenheimer's complex and enigmatic persona. Nolan's monumentalist approach immerses us in the grandeur of the story, exploring the moral implications of Oppenheimer's work and the era's social complexities. The movie's visuals are a symphony of artistry, magnificently capturing the essence of the Los Alamos years and Strauss' sequences. With a stellar supporting cast, ""Oppenheimer"" ignites essential discussions that remain relevant today. Nolan's cinematic brilliance elevates ""Oppenheimer"" to a profound and timeless work of art, leaving a lasting impact on its audiences."
"This movie had made me wonder so much more about Robert J Oppenheimer, what a man he was! This movie was just a masterpiece directed by a legend Christopher Nolan.The annoying part about seeing this movie was, there was a guy, deliberately snoring a few times right next to me, and his phone was on sound as well, which was a nuisance.Still I loved this movie, the acting from the main lead actor, Cillian Murphy had put me a smile in my face, but I won't forget Robert Downey Jr's astounding performance too. Still this movie is so interesting and terrifying because this is based on the father of the atomic bomb. Even though it was too long, I would still would love to rewatch it again. Some scenes were unnecessary but this movie still tops as one of the greatest movies of the 2023.Hoping for Cillian Murphy to win his first Oscar Award!"
"I still vividly remember watching ""Interstellar"" for the first time when I was 10 years old. I was captivated, not necessarily by the story - which I didn't fully understand at the time - but by the manner in which it was portrayed, and by the depth of emotion conveyed by the actors. My experience with ""Oppenheimer"" was similar. Although the movie initially captivated me, I found myself lost for about ten minutes due to my difficulties with English as a second language. However, the remainder of the film had me utterly mesmerized. I would definitely recommend giving it a shot; Nolan never disappoints."
"This is my most anticipated film of 2023 for a single reason and that reason is Christopher Nolan. He is easily my favorite director and when I saw the first trailer for this film I was stunned. I have not seen many new releases this year but from what I have seen this film is the best by far and when Oscar season rolls around this is going to win everything.Christopher Nolan direction is phenomenal and that fact that he said he used zero CGI is a monumental achievement. The visuals in this film are phenomenal and they need to be seen on the biggest screen you can find to thoroughly understand how great they are.This is the best all around cast I have seen in a while. Every single person brought they're A game and I could see multiple people picking up nominations and possibly a couple of wins. Cillian Murphy, oh my god, if this guy doesn't win best actor I will be shocked. This in my opinion is his best performance and possibly the best performance of the decade so far. But he is not the only stud in this film Robert Downey Jr. Was phenomenal as well, and could very easily get a win for best supporting actor. The rest of the cast was incredible, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and more all do amazing jobs.The story is emotional, impactful, and extremely well executed. The score is beyond phenomenal. Everything in this film screams give me an award, and I cannot wait for this to receive the praise it deserves.A+"
"Well paced and deftly edited, ""Oppenheimer"" is a suspenseful drama on the legendary physicist's creation of the atom bomb and its world-shattering implications. Cillian Murphy portrays a wide-eyed eccentric Oppenheimer who juggles the challenges of his personal and professional life where his political affiliations clash with the patriotic nature of his work leading to his later troubles with the law. An all star cast including Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, Gary Oldman, Kenneth Branagh and Rami Malek round up an impressive work. With its unflinching look at war, politics and arms ""Oppenheimer"" raises the issues on the thin line between pragmatism and morality. One of the best films of the year, this is a must see."
"In his twelve film Chris Nolan brings us a character study into onde of the most important and controversial decisions ever made in the history of manquind, the making and decision to use the Nuclear Bomb and we get to see this by the perspective of the man who was in charge of The Manhattan Project Mr J Robert Oppenheimer.Regarding most of his filmography this is a first for Nolan because its character driven and more about the decision to make or dont make The Bomb and once made, to use it or don't use it and after that if we as a society should ever do it again. It's a grey area that we find our main character and the aftermath of the decisions made by these historycal characters is what shapes The 21st century for better or worstJust because we can doesnt mean we should?The film makes us all wonder about the ambiguity of what was done to end the most deadly conflict in human history and the ramifications on the person who was in charge of doing the Impossible, harvesting the power of God and use It for catastrophic destruction.The sound, edit,writing and general performances are the best of the best so expect alot from the cast and crew during the awards season.Its not the most spectacural of the Nolan films ( but with films as Inception and Interstelar who whould have done better) but is the most down to earth character driven and ambigous take of his filmography wich will leave you with hours of topics to think and discuss after watching the film!"
"I don't even know where to begin.Not every director can bring out the best in a star-studded cast, but that's definitely not the case with Nolan.It's a true pleasure to be alive and witness his work, along with Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and many others giving their best.The film's cinematography is one of the best I've ever seen, from the set design to the screenplay, sound, and costumes; everything borders on perfection in the most literal sense.Few movies bring to the senses, even to those less familiar with the art of cinematography, such distinct aspects of audiovisual elements.The only negative aspect is that at some point, the movie ends.Can't wait to watch It more times."
"Great movie, intriguing story and themes, beautifully shot, packed with fantastic actors. The pace is superb, relentless not unlike that of The Dark Knight, yet through three hours of biography, science and politics. Never boring, always suspenseful. Cillian Murphy is exceptional and gives an Oscar-worthy performance. Robert Downey is surprisingly strong and subtle. The musical score was effective, beautiful and interesting, Göransson outdid his work for Tenet. I recall how Jurassic Park partially inspired me to study mathematics, and I wonder how many this movie will inspire to major in theoretical physics, I think it will be quite a few.On the downside, sometimes it was a bit sausage fest with no female characters, many terrific actors felt underused or even misplaced, and the story skewed a bit too much towards the political intrige.Overall, a fantastic movie I will certainly watch again. Highly recommended."
"J. Robert Oppenheimer is a very interesting figure in the history. Therefore, the buzz around this movie is understandable considering one of the biggest director in Hollywood is making the his biographic movie. Nolan is exceptionally talented but he fell in the delusion that his fanbase created. He is really talented behind the camera. The cinematography is amazing. He has a unique eye for crating scenes and framing.His last movies though, are not as impressive as the hype his fans are creatied. This movie is not different than the his averages movies that he started to ake since Dunkirk. His storytelling was phenomenal in Memento, then Prestige, Dark Knight and Inception brought him the fame he well deserved. Yet, the editing which contains so many flashbacks, parallel stories, jump-cuts got too much in his mind and he started to use same recipe in his every movies. Oppenheimer is not an exception. This makes very difficult to follow the stories. I know his fans like the complicated storytelling and are proud of getting it, but this is not the case here. Director misses each stories when he forgets to focus the main one. Really, which story line is the main one here? There are so many stories such as building Los Alamos, creating his team, developing the atomic bomb, the hearing, the life with the women, his controversial past, his relation with scientific community. All make a big dull soup here and we end up with few resolution. When skipping the rule of focusing on one story he jumbles everything and creating a mess. A mess that difficult to follow, which I believe intentional.He needs to go back his routes or started to work with Jonathan again."
"Half of the movie is spent as a courtroom drama and the irony is when the guy at end says to Lewis Strauss that Oppenheimer and Einstein were discussing something more important and the movie itself is focused on Strauss's revenge instead of something more important. The editing made it more difficult to understand than it actually is. Nolan expects us to understand the plot while cutting back to back people talking. Nolan didn't bother with showing the analogy between Arjuna's inaction before war with that of Oppenheimer building a nuke. Nolan completely neglected the importance of Bhagavad Gita even worse is the disrespect. One of the most famous clip of Oppenheimer is where he recites a cryptic line justifying his actions and people would expect to learn more of it but nope. He also didn't the bother with the victims of the bomb. Credit where credit's due, the technical aspects of showing the atomic level visuals is impressive. Overall I would say this movie is a wasted opportunity.""In battle, in forest, at the precipice of the mountainsOn the dark great sea, in the midst of javelins and arrows,In sleep, in confusion, in the depths of shame,The good deeds a man has done before defend him.""Another inspiring quote by Oppenheimer which was not in the movie."
"Oppenheimer had quite possibly the best cinematography of any movie I have ever seen. The visuals were outstanding. I was mesmerized as I watched every scene. This movie was filmed entirely in IMAX and the film stretched multiple miles long. The black and white scenes were also filmed in 70mm Black & White, which has never been used before. This is just the cherry on top of the cinematography.The score in this movie was wonderful as well. The background music kept the movie intense, and even scary in some scenes. The impact that the sound effects made in the theater was incredible, it made the movie that much better. Absolutely wonderful!I don't think I need to get into the acting-but I will. The cast of this movie is as stacked as much as any movie i've ever seen. Cillian Murphy provides a performance of the century, which leads this movie in its success. RDJ also delivers an immaculate performance as the supporting actor, and it is possibly his best performance ever. These two will both be nominated for oscar's this upcoming year. The rest of the cast each had their own role to play and have ZERO complaints with any of them, they all did a wonderful job, 10/10 Acting in this movie.Christopher Nolan did an incredible job depicting the real story and turning into a movie. The movie stays relatively accurate with the actually history of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Nolan chose a piece of history that is not only important to him, but is possibly the most important piece of history ever.This movie will impact cinema in a big way. It has multiple lines that will remembered for a long time. Oppenheimer could single-handedly bring back the popularity of biopic films. This movie was highly anticipated and rightfully so. This is Nolan's best work in my opinion, and that is saying a lot considering he is one of the best directors of our time. I, personally, am thankful to be alive to witness Nolan's work, and especially to witness this cinematic masterpiece of a film.Thank You, Christopher Nolan."
"This is an all-time great movie. The story, performances, and visuals are all as good as it gets. It's difficult to overstate how good the performances are by Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Junior, Emily Blunt and Matt Damon. Christopher Nolan does a masterful job of telling the full story. The three hour running time seemed to fly by.I also loved the alternating time line between the pre-bomb development and the post-war witch hunt which was very effective at building suspense and drama. I saw it a second time in the theatre and thought even more of it after the second viewing. There are so many subtle references and lines that it's almost impossible to catch them all the first time around. This is one of the best movies ever made."
"I watched this movie both in English and Hindi languages,and no doubt this could become one of the highest grossing R rated movies.Positives of the movie is Christopher Nolan's screenplay,direction, performances of the lead cast and soundtrack. These type of movies would easily become slow paced and dull,what makes this movie interesting is fast paced editing, brilliantly crafted non linear story telling.It's true that this movie is not for everyone, but everyone is on for watching it. Oppenheimer is a masterpiece that blends emotions,drama, suspense and horror. CLIMAX of this movie hits harder than a cricket ball!!!"
"This movie was so interesting and engaging to watch and you don't know how 3 hours went. The story, the depiction of events, the performances by the cast members, the direction, the screenplay, the BGM, the pacing; everything were great. You can't find a single error in this movie except visuals but you don't need those type of visuals in this type of movie. Christopher Nolan did it, he has shown us that he can make any type of movie either it be sci-fiction or historical drama.Overall, I will definitely recommend this movie to everyone. It's so engaging and intense that you will definitely love it."
"Nolan delivers on every aspect of this movie. From a technical standpoint to the set pieces and costume designs, everything is nothing less than spectacular.With that being said I couldn't say enough for the story since if you aren't paying your full atention you can get lost and it will seem very boring. This is by no means calling the story bad, but it doesn't quite resolve some issues like what ever happened with his brother. Another minor thing but the score sometimes fw the voices of the characters and sometimes you cant really hear. Unfortunately, you do feel the 3 hour run time for about 2/3 of the entire movie.Now for the obvious stuff... the cast was all frikin amazing. Everyone says Robert D Jr was the best performance in this movie but I would argue that Emily Blunts performance during that court shocked me and my entire theater. Cillian Murphy was literally born to play this role. Frikin phenomenal. AND THE BOMB SCENE. Dont even get me started. Overall pretty good movie first watch but I can see this not being for everyone.As regards to Nolan, I have yet to see many if his movies but from what i have seen, its not even top 3 maybe 4."
"Nice powerful drama for 180 minutes
You don't feel boredAfter the act one the successful mission of test, beings the second act of spinning a web of deceit around Oppie, and the tables turn and how is the rest.Tone of movie is like a strict docudrama, with a exciting soundtrack as aural sweet companion.All actors were top class excelling in their craftDirection is top notchDialogues are you only ally to get by the story so pay close attentionYou always hear some big names thrown in which was nice doffing the hat for those pathbreaking physicists of that time.Will it appeal to a wider audience, I think no, as is no action or comic sequences in this epicBut for people who are interested in history, politics, physics of that time. This movie will be a milestoneMy rating is 10 on 10.. see it in a theatre with reputed sound system as it will elevate your experience."
"In recent years, usually when a film has such a packed cast it often never met expectations so I didn't have many for this, I was confident it was gonna be good but refrained from gauging how good it could actually be. Quoting Greek mythology really set the tone for the rest of the movie. Christopher Nolan is known for blending some sci-fi to his more renowned movies; this is a history biopic but has a lot of elements resembling sci-fi. Building something that at the time period, could only be a pigment of one's imagination. The movie blends together mythology, physics, betrayal, history, philosophy, politics and moral conundrums... maybe this is recency bias but I think this is one of Christopher Nolan's best work.It doesn't climax how I expected it, and in the end, even though the movie heavily involves the Word War and is heavily influenced by war drama, more so US's bombing of Japan, the bomb itself isn't the main focus of the story, although I felt that the movie was leading us there for the first half. There's a lot more to the story and that can be seen as there's still a good chunk of runtime left after the bombing. Everything before that moment, which was a lot, seemed like it was there to help understand Oppenheimer more and the moral dilemmas he faced and how it changed him. I really lost track of time, but before what I think is the last hour of the movie, I thought the movie was about Oppenheimer's bomb, but by the end of the movie you go back to remembering it's a biopic on Oppenheimer himself. An excellent one at that, that almost out any other biopic to shame in my recent memory.The story is told from Oppenheimer perspective, well the colored scenes not the black and white ones which were impartial. We get to see him plagued by guilt and internal turmoil he faced about his betrayal; which was a reoccurring theme throughout the movie, not just to/from Oppenheimer but so many in the film. Mostly about dealing with the consequences of his success, as he's haunted by visions of an apocalypse he helped orchestrate. He started out lost in his youth, but lively at the start of his teaching and Manhattan project, but goes to a dark place after failing to justify his achievement wit the bomb, the nazi threat.The acting was superb all around, and while cillian Murphy stood out, the rest of the star studded cast performances are noticeable. All the main characters had enough screen time to not be overshadowed. Tom Conti was a standout as he used his very limited time as Albert Einstein to great use; I also loved that his and Oppenheimer's story arcs had similar endings. Robert Downey Jnr also does a splendid job, his role takes a turn, somewhat shocking as the movie mainly revolves around the manhattan's projects A-bomb creation that we don't get huge insight into his and Oppenheimer's relationship, only glimpses that you only put together at the end. Casey's Affleck's role was so secretive, he didn't have as much of a pivotal role as a I expected. Emily blunt and Florence Pugh were splendid every scene they were in. I couldn't shake that Emily Blunt's role reminded me of her in The English though, as they were set in similar surroundings. Matt Damon was also good here. Cillian Murphy has had spectacular roles in the past, most notably as Thomas Shelby of which I didn't think he could outdo, but this is probably his career defining performance to date. The cast depth is insane.There are a lot of dark themes explored in depth, so it's a little shocking we don't get to see much of Japan, it's almost glossed over once it's done. But that could be due to us watching from Oppenheimer's standpoint and how he experienced these events. The countdown was epic and suspenseful even though you know knew it was coming. It might be a story you already know from history but Nolan and his cast managed to a create a wonderful character study that submerged you into his story.The music score was great too, helping convey the emotions each scene demanded. I was also surprised by how serene the movie was, while still keeping the thrill of a war drama. How tense and calm the aura of the film was even with a bomb going off.In the end I think it's a perfect biopic, a cinematic masterpiece were we got to see all sides of Oppenheimer, however conflicting and the cast and Nolan did an amazing job depicting his life. It's a perfect movie; the cinematography, the cast, the writing, the score... what else could you ask for."
"First of all if you have a true IMAX cinema near you i would recommend that you go see this movie in that theatre.Oppenheimer is a movie about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the American physicist who played a significant role in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, it has the potential to be a compelling historical drama. The story of Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project is a fascinating and complex one, filled with ethical dilemmas, scientific discoveries, and the implications of nuclear weapons.Cillian Murphy and RDJ were absolutely amazing in this movie and their acting blow me away.For anyone who was hesitant about going to see this movie i would recommend that you see it right away."
"This thing has been talked about for what feels like the entire last year and it was simply... okay. The acting was good and the visuals are striking at time but the plot itself was kinda boring. They spent a bunch of time litigating his security clearance and like... honestly who cares ?? Lol. I was expecting more emphasis on the bomb itself. And sure the first two hours goes into that but the last hour dragsssss. I was expecting more dissection of the psyche of the people were affected by the bombs going off. You really only see it from one point of view - Oppenheimer's. And like okay we get it, he had major regrets about being involved. But who cares? I would've loved to see more from the victims point of view or the towns and cities affected. It was only okay and honestly expected more from a brilliant film maker like Nolan. Honestly I'm sure my opinion on the film is highly affected by the CRAZY STUPID HYPE surrounding this film. Mind you, when films have a lot of hype, I tend to temper my expectations. And I did with this one too, but even still it didn't live up to what I was expecting.If you're wondering if you should see this in theaters, I say no. You'll get just as much of the experience by watching it at home. Especially since the movie is soooo dialogue heavy and the bomb scene is super shot. Also, since this is a review with spoilers, it doesn't even show the actual bomb!!!! So stupid. Just the testing leading up to the bomb. I was here expecting some cataclysmic explosion and watching these towns get destroyed (in hindsight I know it's barbaric and I am not a sadist in the slightest, I don't even like true crime shows to the level most people do). But I just expected... more."
"Strike one: This movie is just a boring mess! Three hours of middle aged men in brown clothes talking, and talking, and talking - just barely audible above the irritating soundtrack.Strike two: The movie completely ignores the hundred of thousands civilians that got burned, killed and left with horrible injuries from the bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki.Strike three: The movie has zero tension. It jumps between different timelines in a most irritating way. It uses shaky hand camera, together with bad cinematography and cheap looking sets.And you're out: The result is a over hyped piece of nothing. They can't even get the test explosion right. I've seen better explosions in B-movies. Please don't give them your hard earned money for this over expensive garbage."
"Watched this film in 15/70 IMAX which is the way the film is suppose to be watched. Did it make a difference? Sort of. It is immersive. But that could be a testament to its editing. It's fast paced for a story that seems to be slow paced.Though the story of Oppenheimer has been done in the past, this one first stages the story as a brilliant scientist, recruited by the military, then makes the bomb, then detonates it, then reaps the repercussions of guilt. Did it have to be 3 hours. No.That said, it is an achievement in all aspects of cinema. Camera work is sublime. You cannot tell me the depth of which this film exists is subpar to anything superhero staged. This is a grown up film made by grown ups who understand nuance and subtlety. But also stage craft. This is something painfully missing and long forgotten since we all started losing our attention spans. This is something that lingers long after it ends.Now, am I speaking in hyperbolic nature? Yes. However, I only understand that some people who go into this are going to wonder what the big deal will be. The exercise is telling a fascinating tale about a exception human that was tasked to do something exceptional. Does it mirror people who have creativity. In a small way, it does. Some of us out here are creative. Want to tackle the beast, but now have to face the responsibility of our creation.The film does something good though. Though it continues to hammer the idea that he takes credit for creating fire that let man destroy themselves, he never is awarded full responsibility. Oppenheimer knew the pieces that fit that could bring it together. But in his creation also ended generations. In today's political climate, it's hard to sit by that knowledge of killing over 200,000 people and effecting millions later. If you understand the gravity of this, this film will hit hard."
"It took nine seconds to decimate the city of Hiroshima with just one first generation atom bomb. That was in 1945. Today, and as of January 2023, there are over 12,500 advanced nuclear warheads around the world. Relating that fact to the review of this film, it doesn't matter whether the atom bomb was invented or the ability to split the nucleus of an atom was discovered. If we could put the knowledge of weaponizing atomic energy into a box, lock it and through away the key, we would still have a huge problem; because the name on that box would read - Pandora.Greek mythology also tells us that Pandora was betrothed to Prometheus. Ironically, the Prometheus referred to in this review is the Pulitzer winning autobiography of the titular J. Robert Oppenheimer. Based on American Prometheus, Oppenheimer from revered director Christopher Nolan sets about telling us exactly what the book does, and that is to relive the triumph and tragedy of the 'father of the atom bomb'.True to Nolan's style of presenting an organic puzzle, the narrative is an interview within an interview interconnecting three crucial timelines in Oppenheimer's life. Presented in black and white is the 1959 Senate Confirmation Hearing of the Atomic Energy Commission for Director Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr) who was responsible for defaming Oppenheimer as a traitor, communist and spying for the Russians. Due to this accusation, the AEC hearing begins in 1954 revoking Oppenheimer's security clearance. And the planning and resources leading up to the detonation of the first atom bomb - codenamed Trinity - takes place in 1945. During the constant shift in these timelines, we come across a plethora of characters (from A-list actors) orbiting Oppenheimer like charged neutrons, pun intended. The most important are General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) supervising the Trinity program at the New Mexico desert in Los Alamos. Director Lewis Strauss as a direct threat and rival from the get go. And the women in his life, wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) and mistress Jean (Florence Pugh).Several other important characters weave in and out of his life as a professor of theoretical physics, to heading the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, to his downfall as an all-American hero. During all this time, we are witnessing the slow build-up and moral anguish of a man who used his intellect and charismatic leadership to create something the world has never known before, and then realise that his creation is nothing but the key to end all life as we know it. This epiphany, if we can call it that, comes to Oppenheimer in flashes of vivid and horrific images. But even before that, Oppenheimer's most tortured vision is the materialisation of a Sanskrit verse from the ancient scripture of the Bhagavad Gita - ""I am now become Death, the destroyer of worlds"". With sunken eye sockets and haunting blue eyes looking at a distant but devastating future, Cillian Murphy as the titular Oppenheimer is an instant front-runner come awards season. Not because he ate one almond a day to transform his physical appearance, or because of his brilliant personification of a psychologically tortured character, or because of the cold and unaffected relationship with the women in his life, but because of that short yet powerful scene when those words are spoken.From its very first scene of rain drops creating ripple effects on the puddle of water it falls on, to the very last scene depicting annihilation of all life on Earth, Oppenheimer is an indicator that Nolan defies convention and mediocrity. Despite being overlong at 180 minutes, and seemingly unevenly paced, Oppenheimer is Nolan stepping away from his penchant for action and sci-fi adventure films while getting back to his roots. If you're thinking Memento, you are in for a cerebral experience. Known for making us think, and even question what we see, this is Nolan channelling his magnum opus in not just telling the world what we have deliberately forgotten, but telling it a way we will never forget. With continuous bombardment of facts and figures, theoretical science and application, and historic names behind the nuclear arms development program, it's a marathon of a film to get through, but never dull. The moment every viewer is waiting for comes two hours into the film and turns out to be Nolan's crowning sequence. We first see it, then we hear it. Then, at the very end of the film and during a hair-raising conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein, we feel it in all its wrath. We feel a sunken weight like watching a Greek tragedy unfold - and that is Prometheus stealing fire from Zeus and gifting it to mankind."
"Nolan wastes none of the viewers time in throwing you into J. Robert Oppenheimer's world. Epic masterpiece. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Are the standouts. Along with Hoytema's cinematography and Göranssons spine-shaking score. The use of the black and white IMAX film is masterful. Although it is three hours, so, make sure your attention span is long and your brain is switched on. Pacing thought was not an issue due to the unbelievable tension. Nolan may just beat his ""not being able to write characters"" allegations. Though Oppenheimer is a real human which makes it easier. Watch this."
"What a historical figure to make a biopic of, what a filmmaker who made it, what an actor who portrayed him. When filmmaking is good its power is immeasurable, not even in Gigatons. And this is good cinema, plain and simple. Using the media of audio and visuals to elicit emotion in a meaningful way.I do think it's Chris's greatest work, a culmination of all his experiments, all his hustle and the years he put in to be trusted by those with the money to make what he wants to make. What set this apart for me is his subtlety with it. It feels like he understood there was no need to shout, to make it spectacular and play service to his fans. In doing so he has surely created a style of biopic that is going to be studied for years to come.I loved it, and am glad I got to see it. It's a great piece of work by great artists, whenever that can happen in the world it should be celebrated."
"This is a super intense, history-driven movie. It's a linear storyline which is good for a Nolan movie. The performances are phenomenal. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Will certainly get the Oscar awards. Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek, Josh Hartnett are all excellent as well. It kept my interest throughout the 3-hour run time and I learned so much about science and history that I did not know before. The storyline explaining how communism, science, and politics were so intertwined and were informing important decisions during the war, was super interesting. I highly recommend this film."
"A great movie in terms of directing and acting, there is nothing wrong with it, except for a very simple thing, which is the flogging scene. It was very bad. As for the movie, it is great, and I can only describe it as the best movie I have seen
I think Cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar for her amazing acting performance and I also think RDJ deserves an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor
Nolan is creative as always , but my advice is to enjoy the movie, do not try to understand everything . I feel the scenes, do not try to understand them. For myself, I think I will watch it again , My rating is 10/10."
"This, just like Barbie, wasn't what I thought it would be, not the traditional Nolan film that you'd expect. For a while, I wondered if it's okay to say ""Anybody could make this, I expected something different from Nolan"" but the more I thought about it, I think this is directorial awesomeness*.If you've not watched this and expect this to be something mind-bending, it's not. What it does bend, are the genres. Science, geo-politics, personal drama, biopic, courtroom thriller, you can't put your finger on any of these and say this is where the movie goes. The writing blends everything seamlessly in such a way that I didn't find any one of these over-done. Good creative choices about the two bomb-drops, IMO.STUNNING acting by everybody involved. This will be Cillian Murphy's long due role that catapults him to the A-List, perhaps even an Oscar nomination for Best Actor? Whom I do think deserves an Oscar - was Robert Downey Jr. You've not seen him play anything like this before. Emily Blunt - doesn't get enough screen time but has a moment in the film that she really owns. Same with the rest of the cast.Cinematography - good! Music - I kept wondering how different this and the sound design would have been had Hans Zimmer been involved, but this was done well. Good creative choice of sound for the Trinity testing.*So, a Nolan movie was a good regular movie? Was there nothing Nolan-esque in it? Not sure if these count - I'd say, how non-linear storytelling was used and some of the dialogue writing (that gives you no context aka no spoon-feeding) was typical Nolan. I've seen several people wish they had subtitles on screen to be able to better follow along.This film isn't for everybody. I guess most Nolan films aren't, but the ones who want to watch a GOOD film, this one is totally for you. Don't judge this film based on the BO collections, it won't make as much money as Barbie does because the latter is a family entertainer. Watch Oppenheimer anyway, ideally back-to-back with Barbie for a cinema experience like nothing else this summer."
"This was one of those movies that leave you thinking and speechless at the end. Walked out of the theater and not one person said a word. Extremely, EXTREMELY compelling. The story was told in the greatest way possible. Thank you Nolan. Haven't been to the movies in roughly 8 years, to see this in Imax (digital cause the film reel broke but bought another ticket for 70mm in a week cause I am such a big fan of this film) was one of the greatest experiences a film nerd could've witnessed. The story telling, themes, plots, timing, was beyond perfect. Kept people wrapped to their seats until the very end."
"Greta Gerwig managed to make a plastic doll feel human, but Nolan managed to make the father of the atomic bomb feel plastic. This three hour long convoluted, bloated and overblown story was very slow and disjointed, and felt poorly edited with random physics imagery thrown in between scene changes.It literally felt like all three writers had their own one-hour distinct genre version of Oppenheimer's story in mind, and simply randomly pieced together sections of each screenplay to fill in the three hour runtime, with each writer's version appearing inconsequential to the other writer's version that preceded them. One version was entirely a backstory, the other about science, and the other about politics, meshed together, out of order, that made it feel like I was browsing back and forth between three different Wikipedia entries.Somewhere in this three hour mess, there actually was a better, shorter, more cohesive and coherent film. I found myself constantly impatient, waiting for something substantial to happen, and when I felt close to being rewarded, the story jumps into a different timeline, event, and color of film. I also was surprised to find portions of the film had a typical B-movie score that felt loud, overbearing, constant and unfitting - not the typical score Nolan is know to impress with.The only redeeming parts of this film were the exceptional performances by the star-studded cast. This film was not even close to Nolan's masterpiece caliber of Interstellar. For someone who never played with Barbies or Kens, I may start now after watching and comparing both film's enjoyment and entertainment values, because this film bombed."
"If you're expecting the next best Nolan thing next to unforgettable greats like Dark Knight or Inception, chances are you're gonna be sorely disappointed with this one.The interstellar cast can not overcome the fact, that this movie - at its nucleus - is just a drawn-out snooze fest of a biopic. A biopic about a man who - according to Murphy's portayal - loved to stare into the emptiness and just happened to invent the atom bomb while doing so.Even the practical effects Nolan always gets justifiable praise for, were basically non-existant in this movie. A bunch of images of swirling liquids and sparks and a handbuilt set is nothing that sets the bar anywhere near what Nolan used to be capable of.There's a certain 20 minutes that will keep you on the edge of your seat, but everything around it is just one of the thickest and most drawn-out plot paddings I've seen in quite some time.So, if you happen to end up watching this in theaters, bring a comfy blanket and a book. Or, just forego it altogether and save that time and money for Dune part 2."
Saw it in imax. I should admit that this is the best cinema experience I have in recent times. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is phenomenal. The screenplay is way ahead of what we predict but is not confusing. There are few scenes which are glued to my mind and are unforgettable. Every actor and actress have given their best. RDJ was so good as Strauss. This movie is definitely for the Physics freaks our there every scene is properly accurate to the theories and laws of the subject. The only issue is the length where I felt that easily at least 10 - 15 minutes could have been easily cut as they were kind of unnecessary to the film.Overall a phenomenal experience in the cinemas. Do watch it only in cinemas with the best sound quality and biggest screen(imax recommended) possible.
"He was deemed ""The Father of the Atomic Bomb""-a man whose core studies on the nature of the universe and the atom itself led to the development of the ultimate Weapon of Mass Destruction; and in his life, he was accused of being a Communist, particularly after his invention (or two of them) atomized Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He was J. Robert Oppenheimer (or ""Oppie"" to his ""fans"" in the world), But while his story is fairly well known to anyone who has studied the history of America from World War II through to the Cold War, it took British director Christopher Nolan to truly bring his epic story to the big screen, which he has done so with OPPENHEIMER.Adapted to the screen by Nolan from the book ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, OPPENHEIMER stars Cilia Murphy as the legendary and (frequently) legendarily controversial scientist whose studies in quantum physics unlock the great secret of the creation of the universe, but which, in the 1930's, were put to use for a much more disturbing purpose. In order to keep this disturbing purpose totally under wraps, Oppenheimer devised the entire building of a small town in New Mexico called Los Alamos. But both his advocacy for unions inside the professions of professors, teachers, and scientists and his loose associations with people who may have (suspected) ties to the Communist Party make him the subject of scrutiny by the U. S. government, particularly the FBI (very much under the control of J. Edgar Hoover). He nevertheless gets support in the development of The Bomb from legendary General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), and fellow nuclear physicist Edward Teller (Benny Sadie) and the great Danish scientist Niels Bohr (Sir Kenneth Branagh). Overall, this makes OPPENHEIMER very much a political drama and an historical drama all in one, with Murphy's performance giving us insight into the psychology and psyche of this great and, in many ways, troubled American genius, and also a look at how America, from the 1940's onward, seemed hell bent on containing the evils of Communism with a nuclear weapons program that, if ever used for real, would wipe out every living thing on Earth.Nolan, known for such great films as 2009's INCEPTION, 2014's INTERSTELLAR, and 2017's DUNKIRK, may have made an incredibly long film out of his subject, with a running time of three hours, but he certainly makes the most of it, particularly in the intense and frightening countdown to the device's test detonation in the New Mexico desert in July 1945. Emily Blunt is quite good as Oppenheimer's wife Kitty; and the supporting turns from Damon, Conti, and Branagh are top-notch all the way. And finally, Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer is a portrayal clearly worthy of being awarded, particularly a very likely nomination for Best Actor at the Oscars.Clearly, this is a masterpiece, and worthy of a '10' rating."
"I Had The Best Cinematic Experience Of My Life And Credit Goes To The Genius Christopher Nolan, As A Long Time Nolan Admirer I Had Huge Expectations Going In, But The Movie Exceeds My Expectations On Every Level. From The Very Start The Movie Grabs Your Attention and Never Lets It Go Till The Credits Roll. The Movie Is Lives And Dies On The Performance Of Cillian Murphy and He Carried The Audience Throughout The Movie, Murphy Nailed The Role Of The Complex Scientist In Every Possible Way. Every Cast Member Gave The Best Performance Of Their Career. The Soul Of The Movie Is It's Background Score. The soundtrack keeps you on the edge of your seats every moment no matter what's happening in the scene. The soundtrack speaks it's own language. At Last But Not Least This Movie would not be possible without the mind of Christopher Nolan."
"I Don't Understand Why People Think Its A Boring Movie When In Reality Its Not, The Movie Delievers A Series Of Entertainment And Excitement During Alot Of Scenes
Specially That Bomb Test,
I Don't Have Words To Describe How Good The Cinematography Was, There Are Alot Of Memorable Scenes In This Movie That You Just Cannot Forget
My Honest Opinion On This Is That Its A Wonderful Movie And I Really Recommend It To Watch It In Cinemas Cause Of The Feel And Experience
Cillian Murphy Stole Everyone's Heart In This Movie
His Acting Was Next To Perfect And The Side Acters Also Did Well
All The Dialogues, Scenes, Its Just Amazing. I Really Think Its One The Greatest Work Of Christopher NolanIf You Wanna Know Which Screen Is Better For Oppenheimer Then It's Obviously IMAX But The Normal 2D Screen Also Delievers A Very Good Quality And Is Worth Watching But Still I Highly Recommend It To Watch In IMAX But If You Can't Then Go For 2D Its Worth ItOverall The Movie Is Amazing And One Of My Personal Favourite MovieThis Movie Could Have Been Better But Its Still Amazing
Really 10/10."
"People don't usually sit through the credits here. The entire IMAX movie theater sat quietly after this one.The movie follows many interwoven timelines, introduces a lot of personalities, many of whom are not terribly clear, which is OK, it is about Oppenheimer and seen from his angle.For me as a trained physicist and a history buff, it was a great experience. However, it is clearly assumed that people know the history already, it is not a history film, it is about a person. I would therefore recommend to read up on history before watching the movie.I think the most interesting part of the storyline is to show how no single group of people, and certainly not a single person, are equipped to make decisions of such importance.We must work to make sure that we never end up in such tragic circumstances again."
"Latest masterpiece from visionary director Christopher Nolan, is a filmmaking brilliance that delivers an unparalleled cinematic experience. GRIPPING historical drama brilliantly showcases Nolan's mastery of storytelling the ability to provoke thought and emotion in the audience.The film's narrative unfolds perfectly, interweaving the complex life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist behind the development of the atomic bomb. Nolan's storytelling finesse kept me on the edge of my seat, deftly exploring Oppenheimer's moral implications of his work without losing sight of grand historical events.""Oppenheimer"" is a feast for eyes, thanking the impeccable cinematography and stunning practical effects. Nolan's signature practical approach to filmmaking, eschewing CGI whenever possible, heightens the realism and authenticity of the film's World War II era setting.This movie is a thought-provoking exploration of the human psyche, ethics, and the consequences of scientific advancements. Nolan's deft handling of these themes elevates the film beyond a mere biopic, making it a poignant reflection on the choices we make as a society and as individuals.""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic triumph that reaffirms Christopher Nolan's place as one of the greatest if not THE greatest directors of our time. With his impeccable storytelling, mesmerizing visuals, and powerful performances, it deserves nothing less than a perfect 10/10 rating. A must-watch for film anyone looking to experience the magic of true cinematic artistry."
"Anyone expecting an Interstellar or Inception type movie from Nolan here, shouldn't. He does a tremendous job of demonstrating his range as a director. Pacing is perfect and it's a biopical/political/philosophical history lesson that inspires thought and debate about the human condition.The acting is superb throughout. My only ick is the way they portrayed Truman. I think he was more torn up about the decision he signed off on than was suggested.So many cameo's from world class actors that are significant and relevant rather than being cheesy. Rami Malek's was my favourite. Very clever how they entwined his character in the plot/climax."
"Before watching this movie, make sure you are rested and clear-headed. Oppenheimer is a drama/biography/history film like no other. You will be taken on a very fast paced journey and learn about the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer and how the atomic bomb was invented. You will be constantly bombarded (pun intended) with stunning acting and dialogue! No guns, no firefights, no monsters or Sci-Fi, and yet so extremely thrilling!As always with Nolan's films, the writing is flawless and the story is masterfully done. It jumps between different time periods with many characters involved, so you have to keep up. This was difficult for me in a crowded movie theater for three hours where it gets very hot. I'd probably have to watch it again, and I think I'll appreciate it even more then. How they managed to do certain things in this film without CGI is a masterpiece in itself.The cast is grand and phenomenal. Every single actor does an excellent job, but there are two that really shine like never before; Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. I'm really hoping for an Oscar here, both for the movie and for those two amazing actors.I think this movie is perfect for today's audience, given the state the world is in now. I think it makes a much bigger impact on people today than if it had been shown 20 years ago. Oppenheimer will surely become a film used for educational purposes in schools worldwide.I must say though, that I miss Hans Zimmer. His music is always epic and always remembered. The right music in itself can make a big impact, and unfortunately that wasn't the case in this film, which I missed a lot.With Oppenheimer, Nolan has done it again. Another very entertaining and very well made film!"
"Not great, not terrible. A whole hour too long. Too convoluted, no clear through line. Same problem Nolan started having with Dunkirk and Tenet, no real character development or motivations. Yes, Oppenheimer ""states"" his reasons for being interested in quantum mechanics and then the bomb, but it's just that. Telling, not showing. A lot of back story happens off screen. Ugh.Make me feel something. Make me care about the characters. The subject matter alone is incredibly interesting (and offers a potentially great internal moral dilemma) but Nolan somehow fubbed it up by trying to make Oppenheimer be about more, like the Red Scare, 20 freaking years after Japan surrendered. It's weird like, what did he really want this movie to be about?There was some great moments, to be sure. Matt Damon stole every scene he was in. The bomb exploding was da bomb. Photography, stunning, but of course. The music was dope, BUT, even that was gratuitous. Literally every single scene had that same sort of weird intense escalation score under-riding it. Cool at first but it got old real quick. It felt like everything on screen was oh so important and thrilling, when in fact, most of the time it wasn't. (When everything's important nothing is.)I just, I dunno. I used to love Nolan's work. This was a boring convoluted mess coming from the mastermind who brought us Memento and The Prestige, both of which are near perfection in concept and execution. I'm more disappointed in him than anything, as more and more he's becoming the sort of self-indulgent director who forgot about the audience's experience entirely. Shame."
"2 hours of bloated, dull storytelling with one hour of decent story. So many celebrity cameos that it was distracting and took you out of the story every time. Everyone clearly wants the chance to cameo in a Nolan film.Nolan needs a hard edit. 3 hours of time I'll never get back. There is a trend of these self important movies thst don't know quite where to find the story.For all the men claiming that barbie wasn't kind enough to men, there's plenty here for you. A parade of white men, not a single interesting woman character. And they did Florence Pugh dirty, with unnecessary nude scenes. She deserves better."
"This movie can be easily called a masterpiece by Christopher Nolan. Though this is a well-known and well-documented story, I think the way it was presented by the director is jaw-dropping. Never in the entire running time of this movie, I felt bored. All the characters essayed the roles in a beautiful way too. Cillian Murphy looked and acted really like Dr. Oppenheimer. Robert Downey Jr.'s role as Lewis Strauss is a class apart too. From the promotions of this film, I thought Robert Downey Jr. Would play a side role, but his role was almost as important as the lead character in this movie. Nolan's play with the black-and-white scenes and their interplay with the chromatic scenes seem like a genius move. I would suggest people to watch it in IMAX, if possible."
"So much to learn about the science of the creation of those bombs! We have an amazing cast, doing things we need to learn about, so we can fully think them through. An eerie scene of the testing of the bomb shook through the whole room, but other than that, it did not live up to the hype that it should be seen on the big screen. Emily Blunt's character was nice to watch as the wife who had to part ways with her self to let the man do his work while she just sat around. On the other hand, there was one woman on the scientists team. Robert Downey Jr. Stole the show, as did Matt Damon.From Figs."
"Oppenheimer is a cinematic triumph that left me utterly spellbound from start to finish. Watching it in glorious 70mm was an experience like no other, immersing me into the stunning visuals that perfectly captured the essence of each scene. The use of color was masterful, enhancing the storytelling and evoking a range of emotions throughout the film.The editing was seamless, seamlessly transitioning between timelines and characters, making it easy to follow the complex narrative. The film's pacing kept me engaged throughout, and I found myself completely absorbed in the characters' lives and struggles.One aspect that stood out significantly was the impeccable sound design. The audio intricacies elevated the entire movie-watching experience, adding depth and authenticity to the story's various layers. It enhanced the emotions and intensity, leaving a lasting impact on my senses.Oppenheimer's storytelling was nothing short of breathtaking. The way it explored the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, and delved into his complex personality, motivations, and the ethical dilemmas he faced, was a captivating journey.Every actor's performance was stellar, bringing life to their respective characters, making them relatable and human. The attention to detail and the commitment to historical accuracy were commendable, making Oppenheimer not just an entertaining film, but also an educational one.In conclusion, Oppenheimer is an extraordinary masterpiece that stands as a testament to the power of cinema. It weaves together history, art, and emotion into a symphony that stays with you long after the credits roll. Christopher Nolan has truly crafted a work of art, and I can confidently say that it is the best movie I have ever watched. If you appreciate remarkable storytelling, top-notch cinematography, and impeccable sound design, do not miss the opportunity to experience Oppenheimer."
"8.5/10
Let's talk about the flaws right away, i did feel the length of the film in all three act especially in the first and second act mostly the build up to the Trinity climax, i thought they added a bit too much, they're definitely missing some one and two key figure and scene that i felt was important to be included in the movie, i actually fine with how they dealt with the Hiroshima and Nagasaki scene, and that's about it really, Oppenheimer was definitely a movie that you have to watch in IMAX, the sound, the color, the resolution, and of course the size of the screen, it is a very fascinating story directed by one of our beloved and best movie director's right now, played so incredibly well by Cillian Murphy, calling Oscar's best actor nomination already, a 3 hours epic biopic that is unique and i've never seen before, i was engaged by the story the whole time, and while i can see lot's of people will mixed about it, well i recommend you to at least read the story before just so you know a little bit of background, then you can at least appreciate it, what Nolan does with Oppenheimer is his way of narrating the film was just terrific, again added with terrific performance by all the cast, the beautiful practical effects and the way they edited it was incredible, overall Oppenheimer was indeed a terrific movie, despite the flaws of a missing key figure and scene and phasing, i was still entertained, i was still engaged, i was still blown away, and i was still amazed by the movie."
"This movie is factually consistent, but is simplistic and more feeling on the science, but that is the intend. It shows the terror, power and beauty in fission explosion. It is very subjective telling of the events, and thus lends itself for artistic view on psyche and reality.This movie excels mostly in imagery and tension. It cleverly blends and sequences imagery for effect in either story telling, emotions or mixed mind or opinions. It works best when showing the feeling after the war was won. (the gym hall speech). It is the best scene in the movie and possibly best of Nolan's career.The negative however goes to screenwriting or I think this stems from there. The movie is 3 hours long and the ending 45 minutes delves into the aftermath of Oppenheimer's leadership. Up until that the movie is on a mission and has momentum. It will somewhat stop when the conversation phase starts. This is brilliantly done in black and white to give contrast in perspective and style, but instead of taking the music away for the voices to be heard, the movie turns them rather high and thus lets the music direct instead of the actors and dialogue. They both easily could carry it, BUT either by the decision of Nolan or Studio, they might have decided against, because of the runtime and audience target. (TLDR; they turned the music on, because either studio or Nolan wasn't confident in audience getting through it.)In my opinion it would have worked perfectly with more subtle music in the last 45 minutes, it would have made even bigger contrast than the black and white + style change."
"Oppenheimer is beyond just a story of his life. It is an experience with so much detail and attention to important things that motivated the physicist to come up with such a groundbreaking idea. This film proves to you why this was the most historical thing to happen, rather than just saying it. It opens your curiosity and wonder through the first half and as soon as the trinity test begins, it is nerve racking and intimidating how suspenseful the results are. The last half may seem like it's beginning to go nowhere, but redeems itself and shows the most powerful political message. It shows that after all of the contributions Robert Oppenheimer gave to the government to make sure this would work, he was now betrayed and left to the side after they took advantage of his work. It shows that our society needs to be careful and know that others may corrupt your accomplishments and take advantage of you, and have nothing to do with you. The last half was not only just a result of what the bomb did for the world, it shined on an insanely important political message. Amazing movie."
"This film is heavily dominated by dialogues. If you are a fan of action-packed films, you might find it boring. Although the film revolves around the topic of an atomic bomb, don't expect to see numerous explosions throughout the movie. Instead, it focuses not on the scientific formation of an atomic bomb, although there are some theories explained briefly, but on detailing the journey of Oppenheimer with his ideas, knowledge, strategies, and all the complexities he faced in creating the atomic bomb, which was ultimately used on Japan.This film is expensive and high-class, destined for the Oscars without a doubt. It features a star-studded cast, even the minor roles (despite having little screentime) are portrayed by familiar faces. It's incredible, really.To this day, I just can't stop thinking about the Trinity scene. That's the pinnacle of the film, the moment when my breath was held, and my eyes were glued to the screen. It's remarkable how Nolan manages to make this scene so intense and chilling. Presented with impeccable visuals, music, and acting that needs no doubt, I am truly impressed with this film. The ending was nothing short of a masterpiece that left me with a deep sense of emotion.Surprisingly, this is one of the few Nolan films that I could still understand without being perplexed (apart from its scientific theories). I wish I had a better grasp of the science behind the atomic bomb in this film so that I could give it a rating of 10/10.Thank you Mr. Nolan and Mr. Cillian, you have once again reminded me of the beauty of the cinematic world.-@fineapplespov."
"Murphy is exceptional, the movie is amazing. Bot everyone will understand or like this movie, but for who wants to see a masterpiece, than this is the movie to see.Robert Downey Jr. Showed everyone that he is a huge actor, Matt Damon and Emily Blunt have both done wonderful roles, along with everyone in this movie.Amazing plot and how the atomic bomb is not the highlight of the movie, due to how the plot is made, really is a mind-blowing piece of highly skilled directing.If only there where more movies that would come close to this one, and the movie making business would thrive once againChapeau to Christopher Nolan and the future masterpieces he will direct."
"This movie has too much going on and not enough at the same time. The focus seems to be communism and a senate confirmation hearing rather than the reasoning and human impact of the bomb. The war is always far off and distant, the impact on Japan only briefly mentioned, and the real person we are to have sympathy on is the title character. Even the building of the bomb lacked the challenge and exploration that it could have. It could have been at least 30 minutes shorter and even shorter focused less on the communism angle. While it hinted at why the bomb may have not needed to be dropped, since the viewer is left with no understanding of the state of the war with Japan it feels like more of an intellectual discussion than an in the moment approach to bringing the world's worst war to a close."
"Let's start with the positives:
Main Cast was great - Cillian, Emily, Matt, RDJ were absolutely great and it was good to see Josh Hartnett who is a very under rated actor.Good screenplay, dialogues, sets of of 1940s.Negatives:
Absolute slugfest of a story. Hard to believe this was a Nolan's movie. It's waaay too overhyped because of his name. Personally I think he has lost that touch. The story kept flip flopping from characters personal life to the main project then into 2 different hearings at two different timelines. There were no indications of the timelines at all, you just keep floating around in different timelines where all of them look the same pretty much. So it was confusing to keep up. It doesn't talk about the World War in proper context. Doesn't show anything on Hiroshima, just a few mentions of it and that's pretty much it.-Why did this need 70MM IMAX cameras? 95% of this movie is person to person dialogues in a normal room setting. There's no action sequence of any kind. Only one small explosion scene that lasts like 30 seconds tops. So why is Nolan making all the fuss about taking up all of the IMAX screens. Personally I feel IMAX should've remained for Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning. It was a faaar superior movie for IMAX than this.I dare you to imagine this movie being exactly the same but take out Nolan's name. It would definitely not do well at the box office. It's definitely feels overrated and would've been better in a documentary instead of a full fledged ""IMAX 70MM"" film. Ridiculous.Overall, you can wait to stream it when it comes out or can skip it. Not much you're missing out."
"Christopher Nolan is the only filmmaker these days that can have a historical biopic open big in the summer movie season. This film is usually saved for an end of the year release to give it the best chance for Oscar consideration. It has been heavily marketed as an event film that needs to be seen in IMAX because Nolan filmed it with IMAX cameras. Even though I agree that the film seems big because of it's director and huge cast but as great as this film is it is much more a character driven film than it's being marketed as and that a good thing.It is abot J. Robert Oppenheimer and his world on the top secret Manhattan Project that produced the worlds first nuclear explosion this changing the course of history. The basic story is well known but because the film focuses on character Oppenheimer is presented in a very three dimensional way in a great performance by Cillian Murphy. The film doesn't shy away from showing Oppenheimer as a very flawed but brilliant man. The cast is uniformly great. Especially Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss, a friend than nemesis of Oppenheimer
The cast is so full of known names in small but pivotal roles that they are too many to count. But as big as this movie looks and feels at times it's a very harrowing and riveting character driven drama about a complicated man. The film is 3 hours long but never feels slow. There is a moment that we all waited for in the film that is played more subtly than I thought it would be played.Of course there are things about this film that will leave us to think about but Christopher Nolan doesn't ram anything down the viewers throat. The significance, good or bad about the existence of nuclear weapons is of course part of the film but it gives no easy answers.Another complex film from a director that is one of the best working todayGrade: A."
"""Oppenheimer"" may be the greatest biopic I have ever seen. Christopher Nolan has struck gold again. The film is beautiful, terrifying, and leaves you thinking after the credits roll. The acting in this film is amazing. Cillian Murphy shines in the spotlight and deserves a nod at best actor, and Robert Downey jr. Puts on one of if not the greatest performance of his career. The practical effects are stunning, and brings to life the horror of an atomic bomb. The score is masterful portraying the right themes in the perfect moments. This film needs to be seen by everyone and on the biggest screen possible."
"Oppenheimer is a great film by any standard. Important subject matter. Good script. Fantastic cast. Brilliant acting. Cillian is killing it, and pretty much every supporting actor performs beautifully. The special effects are impressive.Oppenheimer is more or less flawlessly done. And yet it isn't one of my favorite Christopher Nolan movies. Just like Dunkirk wasn't. For me, some of his best qualities get wasted when he's telling a reality based story like Oppenheimer. Or Dunkirk, for that matter. Why? Because he can tell a fantastical story and have me believe it. In a way nobody else can.My favorite film by Christopher Nolan remains Inception, which got better and better the second, third and even fourth time I watched it. Each time I found new details and clues that I had missed the first time. Tenet was similar in that respect, and Interstellar as well. Even his earlier work, like Following and Memento, had elements of this. But I doubt that I will find anything new the next time I see Oppenheimer. It will still be very, very good. But it won't be better."
"For films like Oppenheimer, we fell in love with cinema, in short (Oppenheimer), which is the perfect meaning of the perfect, flawless, distinguished film, which Nola succeeded in presenting an exceptional biographical film. This movie is the greatest cinematic experience I've ever had. Nolan presented a historical and innovative masterpiece in terms of storytelling and ambiguity in a well-known true story. He presented the dialogues in an interesting and enthusiastic manner. The soundtrack was used in the film with the events in a great way. The sound effects are the best ever. As well as visual. Great acting performance by Murphy, Junior and the rest of the film's cast. The film has many of famous actors who were not disclosed in the film's trailer . Don't miss this movie. Thank you, Nolan and the rest of the crew."
"Directing great, Christopher Nolan, is back with his vision, of how the events of the Manhattan Project, resulted in the creation of the atom bomb. Nolan film alumnus, Cillian Murphy, plays the titular character in this film, J. Robert Oppenheimer. This film has a great cast in it, which incudes Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves. It is a role originally done by Paul Newman, in the slightly criticized, but still worthy motion picture, about those events, in Fat Man and Little Boy (1989). Oppenheimer (2023), also utilizes the great acting prowess of Iron Man, Robert Downey JR., as Lewis Strauss. Nolan film alumnus, Gary Oldman, gives another brilliant performance as Harry S. Truman.This film is riveting, stunning, mesmerizing, stressful in some ways and edited together, with a brilliant pace. Its massive three hour runtime moves along just fine. The way Nolan intercuts images, like the mushroom cloud, at pivotal moments of the film, in-between the scenes documenting Oppenheimer's life and the events at the Manhattan Project, is one of the best editing jobs I've ever seen in 21st century cinema. Nolan also shows his prowess, with audio tricks, that help emphasize the images and emotions, coming across the screen. And, speaking about audio, the music soundtrack is perfect for this film. You would think, that Nolan film alumnus, music composer, Hans Zimmer was involved with this film, but he was not. Equally brilliant film composer, Ludwig Göransson does the soundtrack for this film and it is beautiful. This was a memorable three hours at the movie theater. What an epic.9.4 (A MyGrade) = 9 IMDB."
"A dense, slow-burn but undeniably a master class in filmmaking. The cast is full of stars who all do some of their best work. The sound, score, & editing are all amazing & create a very tense tone from start to finish..

"Christopher Nolan has once again delivered a cinematic marvel with his latest film, Oppenheimer. From start to finish, every second of this lengthy masterpiece is worth the journey, offering an unforgettable exploration of human psychology, ethics, gripping scientific discoveries, and perfectly paced storytelling.In a world where biopics can sometimes fall short in capturing the essence of their subjects, Nolan stands apart, pouring his heart and soul into Oppenheimer. Watching the film leaves audiences in awe, reflecting on the incredible artistry they have just experienced. The dialogue writing and conversations are the heart of the film, deftly delving into the complexities of the characters and their moral dilemmas.The elaborative and talented cast is worth mentioning, with Cillian Murphy delivering a stellar performance, portraying Oppenheimer's great complexity with finesse. But it doesn't stop there; every member of the cast leaves a lasting impact on the film, adding depth and authenticity to the narrative.Visually, Oppenheimer is a treat for the eyes. From start to finish, the movie offers stunning visuals that capture the essence of the era and transport the audience into the world of Oppenheimer and his groundbreaking scientific endeavors. Especially during the pivotal build-up moments, the visuals are nothing short of breathtaking, leaving viewers at the edge of their seats.One cannot overlook the significant role of sound, music, and symphony in this film. The carefully curated soundscape heightens the emotions and lets the viewers truly feel and immerse themselves in the story. The combination of stunning visuals and a captivating musical score creates a captivating experience that stays with the audience long after the credits roll.Oppenheimer is beautifully shot and well-crafted, showcasing Nolan's dedication to his craft and his willingness to push the boundaries of filmmaking. Instead of settling for a straightforward biopic, Nolan dives deep into the psyche of his characters, delivering one of the most authentic portrayals of this era on the silver screen.It is an absolute triumph. Christopher Nolan's dedication to storytelling, his commitment to exploring the human condition, and his willingness to push cinematic boundaries shine through every frame of this film. It's an emotional and intellectually stimulating journey that deserves to be appreciated and cherished. Take the time to watch this cinematic gem, and you'll be left with a profound sense of awe and admiration for the art of filmmaking. All credit goes to Nolan for creating a masterpiece that will be remembered for years to come."
This movie is arguably the Nolan film with more conversations than visual treatment. The movie is non-linear with a court room kind of trial at the main proceedings. Robert Downey Jr and Cilian Murphy are just too good for the roles.At some point you wonder where is this heading with too much conversations. The movie weighs heavily on the convoluted character of Oppenheimer played by Murphy. This is one of the truest biopic that does not glorify / villify the protagonist. It stays as close as to an enigmatic theoretical scientist and his world of science and morality.The last act is good!!
"Acting was great, considering the plot is a boring documentary buried underneath a pretencious confusing cerebral adventure through multiple timelines. This movie was seemingly written by somebody who is old and confused, unable to piece the story together in a coherent way but able to remember it in extreme detail. A collection of trailer-like cuts almost built for a generation of people with a shorter attention span, making me feel like i was being explained the story instead of watching it.I know this opinion will be disagreed with, but I hated this movie and really couldnt wait for it to end. Yes, yes, the actors are great. Downey performed a character that is interesting and devious, the lead, Cillian Murphy, was very good and carried the movie all the way through. Unfortunately he was forced to carry this documentary on his back because of the poor story construction and other charcters getting minimal screen time.Oppenheimer was a physicist, a theory and math based profession that is extremely hard to make appealing to people or to properly explain. Why this was chosen to be a mainstream movie instead of an 80 min documentary produced by netflix is beyond me. So kudos to the effort, it was a solid attempt. However the cerebral almost Kubrick like story exposition was hard to digest when used to tell a more fact based history of a boring man building a bomb."
"So this movie is 3 hours long. You know how Director's Cuts include stuff that was edited out of the theatrical version? In this case the Director's Cut needs to remove an hour.Just for background I studied both Astro and Sub-Nuclear Physics in college, and even I was bored to tears. I looked over at my girlfriend, whose excited idea it was to go and even insisted on paying for the tickets. Yep, she was fast asleep for at least half the movie, and this was the 6pm to 9pm showing, not the past her bed time timeslot.So much of this movie is just plain unnecessary, like the director was trying to vamp and pad for time, when instead he should've gone crazy w/the digital snips and dumped about half of it. The side thread w/the Commie gf was so inane, it was obvious her only role in the film was as a pair of b**bs, her character was otherwise 98% irrelevant. I think even the director knew there'd have to be some T&A to keep the audience from sleeping all the way through.Another example of unnecessary padding. Special effects meant to convey how Oppenheimer thought about quantum mechanics and the universe. References to String Theory and other nerd science stuff I'm sure would be lost on 99 out of 100 people watching it. Worse, they don't do this just once, for 30 long seconds, but 3 or 4 times. To quote Cinema Sins. ""Movie has time for this?""RDJ and Cillian Murphy were perfectly cast, as were the myriad of famous Physicists of the early 20th century. Otherwise though this is a story about a man whose one lifetime achievement, incredible as it was, took up 3 years of his life, and what we got was a biopic of that plus 33 more years of his life that's only mildly interesting."
"Oppenheimer was everything I wanted it to be and more. The three-hour run time is very warranted. Not only does it, not waste time. It shows you the realistic experiences of what the makers of the bomb and, most importantly, J Robert Oppenheimer went through making this. You don't have to like this movie if it's not your cup of tea, but if you say it is terrible, you are either straight-up stupid or insane. This is easily one of the best films of the year. If not the best, we will soon see, but I doubt it. This might not be my favorite Nolan film, but it might be his best and most Oscar-worthy. With a $100 million budget, this puts Disney to shame with all these effects being practical and something like Dial of Destiny being a lot of CGI. Please see the film, and you won't regret it."
"Just when you think it can't get better than The Dark Knight or Inception, Nolan comes out with his Magnum Opus. The mind and skill required to craft this puzzle is truly extraordinary, and Nolan has cemented himself as one of the greats of all time with this movie.The story strikes the right balance in so many ways by delicately depicting the puzzle that is the politics of war and national security, relative to the social good for mankind. At a surface level, the theme of war is not appealing, and many may not like Oppenhiemer's legacy, and that's the genius of this movie. Despite its length, it is engaging from minute one and the videography & use of background music leaves you glued till the 180th minute. It makes it a human story about Oppenhiemer, and yet gets under your skin and has you thinking about the perils of warcraft and the arms race. It has you asking should human technological development have boundaries? Who should decide those boundaries? And who should hold the key to the big red button? An extremely relevant topic in this new age of AI.To top off Nolan's efforts are superlative performances by the cast -- too many to mention individually, but without question a career best performance by Cillian Murphy in the lead role. Nolan's craft elevated each and every one of the cast to raise the bar, and it was seamlessly woven together on screen.This should be a must see for any and all, especially in this era where we seem to have forgotten about the horrific consequences of global warfare; precisely when we forget, are we at greatest risk thereof."
"This is a long one and people who know my reviews will know I'm no fan of films longer than 2 hours and this one was 3 hours - realistically I could have and should have ended after 2.5 hoursHaving said that it was an incredibly engrossing film you were drawn on from the moment it started for the next two hours or so it was incredibleStorytelling and Cinematography were top notch , casting was superb, Robert Downey Jnr will walk away with best supporting actor oscar easily , but apart from that all the cast were superb with a great cameo by Gary Oldman as Truman & Tom Conti as Albert EinsteinThis wasn't so much a biopic from birth to death but a retrospective look at the highlight of his career and the political infighting surrounding his potential fall from grace and skulduggery and Shakespearean backstabbing going on all around him . This is where the tension was and it was told incredibly well and so absorbing .The cinema has been packed this week with Barbie mania and you feel sorry for the people going to see that as you know how disappointed they'll be the car park has never been so full so if box office success is all about marketing then that film is a success but if you want to see a film with substance not just hype then Oppenheimer is a better betWorth seeing for surePad. A 9/10."
"Definitely an Oscar winning movie, Nolan as usual challenging himself beyond the limit of CGI and creating amazing locations. All actors did tremendous performances especially Cillian. Cillian perseverance in every character & role makes him really deserving of winning an Oscar. It's not a typical biography movie you'd expect but it's full of science and physics which Nolan clearly loves. And then comes the movie score it was on point in every scene escalating to the movie theme music. Knowing that it's a 3h movie it's not easy to keep you involved in the movie the whole time but Nolan did & and he did it brilliantly."
"Christopher Nolan just gets it. I mean, that shouldn't be a surprise for anyone. He's proven time and time again why he's among the greatest filmmakers of this generation and Oppenheimer is another exhibit to his greatness. This was a complex story told ingeniously. Some people complain that it was too long, but I disagree wholeheartedly. In fact, I would argue that it could've even been longer!To fully enjoy this movie, you also have to know what you're going to get going into it. It's not about the creation of the atomic bomb. This movie is about J. Robert Oppenheimer. It's about his life and how his creation affects him.I also can't give all the credit to Christopher Nolan, however. The cast of this movie was incredible and every actor and actress brought their best, especially Cillian Murphy who delivered an Oscar-worthy performance as Oppenheimer. The score by Ludwig Goransson was also incredible.Overall, this movie is fantastic, but I also can see that it may not be for everyone. Nevertheless, I still think it's a 10/10."
"Through this entire movie, I was on the edge of my seat. The acting, the cinematography, everything was perfectly done. The sound effects made it 10x better. Don't miss the chance to see it in a theatre
since movies as good as they have become so rare, sadly.Cillian Murphys performance was exceptional. Mind blowing. Unforgettable-RDJ also had an incredible performance
-Emily blunt gave her performance just the right amount of emotion. Amazing

I can go on and on with such an amazing and well put cast, but truly, incredible and
I can confidently say that this is a perfect movie. I urge everyone to go and watch it. RUN."
"I was afraid that 3h would be too long, I was wrong. The movie captured my attention from beginning to the end. The whole film making turned the experience involving and epic.There are a lot of ""easter eggs"" for those interested in history of science. One of my favorites was the bongo from Feynman (those that appear on his Lectures on Physics...).They don't use the screen time to teach physics (and I think this was a good decision) although a few small concepts are explained.Not everything was perfect, the impactful phrase ""Now I've become death..."" was said without no impact in the movie. Anyway, I left the cinema with the feeling of ""wow, marvelous""."
"One of the best nolan's films ever. It's not just about the powerful message the movie itself has but also the movie is so well done, smart, clever, holistic, is not enough to say.Murphy is definitely an oscar winner. I was not expecting anything, didn't even see the trailer but it comes in a perfect timing, as we all know, war is here and this movie reminds us what humans are capable of, how duty must be complied, and how terrible we can become. We are the worst and the best in the earth according to this movie. This film is memorable, unique and brilliant. I recommend everyone from each country to watch it."
"Oppenheimer (2023):I have seen every Christopher Nolan's movie - not in order but they should be seen in order. You can witness his growth as a director and the growing influence of production companies he's working for. His best movie is still Following (1998) which contained really long still shots with absolutely no soundtrack at all. Slowly, he or his bosses fell in love with Hans Zimmer and similar composers over the years - so much that there's never ever a 'quiet' scene in his movies anymore.Talking about the editing techniques, with the help of cuts, he was able to show three different timelines in Following (1998). He went a bit overboard with this style in Memento (2000) and now it's reached the stage that it literally can cause headaches.Oppenheimer (2023) was, sadly, an over-the-top blend of non-stop overly loud soundtrack and hundreds of cuts with a speculative approach towards the character and his emotions. There were so many unnecessary cuts that it felt impossible to care about any character. These ""parallel"" scenes were needed in Memento, Inception or maybe some of his other movies but why would you need to do something like this again in a biopic? Why was there a need of epic soundtrack when two characters were, for example, having a trivial conversation?A few impressive things about the movie included strong acting performances from some really big names (but I couldn't care about any character just because scenes kept cutting for no reason) and an incredibly well crafted nuclear explosion scene with delayed sound effects - this was probably the closest thing to reality.This movie could have been so much better if it weren't for the forced cheap tricks which, I'm beginning to think, he's very afraid to deviate from. No one talks about Following (1998) anymore and he probably understands that. He is stuck in his comfort zone and he won't ever get out of it. I recently found out that he's a fan of Terrence Malick which makes a lot of sense now. However, when Terrence Malick adopts this style, it works. That's the difference.I couldn't like the movie. I tried. I really tried.5.5/10."
"The tension grows for a while but then it feels we never reach a climax that a 3 hour long movie would suggest. If you are ready to learn about the politics of the time mostly via dialogs, this movie may be for you. Nolan's work was always visually inspiring as well and had a good balance between dialogue, action and visuals. In this case the balance felt off. It's like one of those extended director's cuts when they really try to include everything even tho it comes with the loss of momentum. It's still an interesting film, but it feels that the shared premiere date with mainstream Barbie movie has created a bigger hype for Oppenheimer as well than the film actually deserves."
"""Openheimer,"" the much-anticipated cinematic collaboration between visionary director Christopher Nolan and the incredibly talented actor Cillian Murphy, is an intellectually stimulating and visually captivating journey into the life and mind of one of the most enigmatic figures in history, J. Robert Oppenheimer. With this biographical drama, Nolan once again proves his prowess in delivering mind-bending narratives, while Murphy's performance shines as he fully embodies the complex character of Oppenheimer.The film delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who led the Manhattan Project during World War II, leading to the development of the atomic bomb. But ""Openheimer"" is not your typical biopic. Nolan skillfully weaves together different timelines, exploring the tumultuous events of Oppenheimer's life in a non-linear fashion, much like a complex puzzle. This approach immerses the audience into the physicist's psyche, providing a glimpse of his thoughts, fears, and inner conflicts.Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer is nothing short of mesmerizing. With nuance and depth, Murphy captures the brilliance and tormented soul of the scientist. He effortlessly portrays the internal struggles of a man torn between his love for science and the moral dilemmas arising from the destructive power he helped create. Murphy's ability to convey Oppenheimer's intellectual genius and emotional vulnerability makes the character highly relatable, despite the weighty decisions he faced.The supporting cast also deserves commendation, with exceptional performances from Anne Hathaway, who portrays Kitty Oppenheimer, and Michael Caine, taking on the role of Richard Tolman, a close friend and advisor to Oppenheimer. Their chemistry with Cillian Murphy enhances the emotional impact of the film and adds further layers to the complex narrative.As expected from a Christopher Nolan film, ""Openheimer"" boasts outstanding technical craftsmanship. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is a visual feast, capturing both the grandeur of scientific discovery and the haunting consequences of humanity's actions. Hans Zimmer's evocative score elevates the film's emotional intensity, complementing the story's multi-layered structure.While ""Openheimer"" showcases the brilliance of its creators, it may not be a film for everyone. The non-linear storytelling style can be intellectually demanding, and some viewers might find themselves lost in the complexity of the narrative. However, for those willing to engage with the material and invest in unraveling the puzzle, the rewards are plentiful.In its exploration of ethics, the consequences of scientific progress, and the inner conflicts of a brilliant mind, ""Openheimer"" raises thought-provoking questions that linger long after leaving the theater. Nolan's deft direction and Murphy's tour de force performance make this film a must-see for cinephiles who crave intellectual stimulation and appreciate a visually striking cinematic experience.In conclusion, ""Openheimer"" is a mind-bending masterpiece that showcases the immense talent of Christopher Nolan and Cillian Murphy. As a biographical drama that challenges the traditional conventions of storytelling, it pushes the boundaries of what cinema can achieve. With its thought-provoking narrative, exceptional performances, and stunning visuals, ""Openheimer"" leaves a lasting impression and solidifies its place among the finest works of modern cinema."
"Two things got me into the theater. They were the interesting subject and curiosity about how such a story would be told. Plus the fear that this fun theatrical experience might tank before I got around to it. No worry, there. This is the stuff of legend, as it should be. This thought provoking movie tells us exactly why that is so. If you don't know anything about what happened prepare to be amazed. It is based on a book and reading history might also be something you would enjoy. I was a little surprised at the style. A little chaotic and loud. It all comes together, though. One character, an ordinary (seriously smart) man called by unusual circumstances to participate in one of the greatest events in contemporary history. It also tells why anyone would ever do such a thing, for it is quite awful in every sense. Anyway, if you can get past the effort to get us into Oppenheimer's head using weird graphics and strange musical effects, the somewhat altered depiction of real events in the interest of storytelling, and the three hour run time, you may find yourself rewarded with a first class entertainment."
"I will be in the smallest of majorities where I was not blown away (😳) by Murphy's performance. He is emotionless, calculating, and nuanced, but in the shadow of Downey and Blunt, who both give incredible performances.Nolan is clearly at the peak of his creativeness and prowess as a Director and writer and I'm a true fan. The political wranglings of the era are portrayed elegantly, but take over the story in a way that takes the focus away from the the biopic character study and existential plot inquiries.What is truly genius in Oppenheimer is the use of an insanely gifted supporting cast. Damon shines, though his arc is undefined at the end. Blount is fierce in role as Kitty Oppenheimer. I personally do not understand the Pugh obsession and in particular in this film, her best acting is done with no clothes on and in death.Why is Randy Quaid playing the bongos?"
"TLDR: this is what Hollywood has needed for a long time!I'll be honest I went into this movie with pretty high expectations. Being a fanatic of the great scientist behind the manhattan project I wanted to see their lives given justice in this film.And well I was simply impressed with the story telling of this film. The way Nolan filmed three perspectives of the same story. Weaving the threads of the joy of scientific discovery, the political conflicts and the moral implications of the A bomb. And showing it in an expertly written sequence.I was impressed by the acting by all the actors from the leads to the extras the entire cast really embodied their characters. In simple terms it would be amazing to see more films like this!"
"Christopher Nolan has already made a case for why he is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time with films like Interstellar, Inception, Dunkirk and Prestige. Now he has come up with another film that elevates his one of a kind of filmography and pushes the envelope of what defines him as a Filmmaker.Oppenheimer is not your run-of-the-mill Nolan film, it's a character study at it's heart, a film exploring a peculiar mind and the rather unusual circumstances it found itself under.Every detail is carefully crafted. The first half of the film was a bit tedious at times but it all plays out in the end beautifully. The way the multiple subtexts of the film were driven home is as fitting as it is engaging.I Absolutely loved Robert Downey Jr's performance, definitely one of the stand outs. Cillian Murphy lived and breathed as J Robert Oppenheimer, there is not a cell in me that isn't convinced the man on screen was the father of the Atomic Bomb. The Visual flair that Hoyte van Hoytema and Nolan brought is so fresh and welcome especially considering how none of it's CGI. I have heard complaints about heavy exposition but I never noticed any.It's less of a Crowdpuller and more of an Award winner than it seems, it might help to tune your expectations."
"Directed and written by Christopher Nolan. A runtime of three hours with an R rating.This is the film about American Scientist ""J. Robert Oppenheimer"" played by Cillian Murphy. The brilliant brain that helped make the Atom bomb. The same atomic bomb they dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to cripple Japan. Resulting in America and its allies winning WWII.You see a young ""Oppenheimer"" navigating through life going from one elite program to the next. Always trying to further his knowledge by rubbing elbows with some of the smartest minds on Earth.""Oppenheimer"" was what Kanye West says he is a ""free thinker"". This caused him to dip his toes in waters some might frown upon. As well as meet people from all walks of life. Separating the person from their beliefs.""Oppenheimer"" was able to dabble in his brother ""Frank Oppenheimer"" played by Dylan Arnold communist party. He even meets his mistress ""Jean Tatlock"" played by Florence Pugh and his eventual wife ""Kitty Oppenheimer"" played by Emily Blunt there. He toed the line perfectly never committing to the organization.You watch how ""Oppenheimer"" met great minds some allies and some future enemies. Seeing how his path crossed with future frenemy ""Lewis Strauss"" played by Robert Downey Jr. As well as how working at Berkeley and across from ""Ernest Lawrence"" played by Josh Hartnett subsequently help him meet ""General Leslie Groves"" played by Matt Damon. Who eventually appointed ""Oppenheimer"" as director of the ""Manhattan Project"".You see the makeup of the man the world grew to know and love. You also see the consequences of his and his subordinate's actions. In this masterful film.""Oppenheimer"" was one of Christopher Nolan's best films. I'm biased toward the ""Dark Knight"" franchise. After that, it's ""Inception"" for me. But this might beat that. There were so many great actors and I mean a ton. This is one of the first films that the extras were great actors.Throughout the film, I kept saying oh that's such and such. It was a long film but I think it needed to be that length. A lot of things happened, and they had a lot to cover. I pride myself on knowing a lot of things about the Second World War. But I don't know much about the Atomic bomb's inception.This film was so knowledgeable. I also wondered why did Russia and America go at one another after the war. This explained how America and Russia had issues before the war. They only became Allies of convenience. Something I didn't know prior.Robert Downey Jr. And Cillian Murphy put on an acting clinic. You can tell Cillian has worked with Christopher Nolan for twenty years being in multiple films of his. Christopher said he didn't write the film in mind for Cillian but boy did he fit the casting perfectly.I didn't like Robert Downey Jr. Slighting Marvel while doing his shortened press run. He mentioned because of Marvel he didn't know if he could still act to do this role. Well, you were rich before but Marvel made you filthy rich. Don't slight them because you're done with them. Oh and to just put it out there you didn't lose your acting capabilities. This role will probably earn you a Best Supporting Role nomination at the Oscars. Hopefully, if the strike is over by then.Lastly, I talk crap about writers that are directing the film too. It doesn't always come out well. In this case, Christopher Nolan is seasoned at it and I have the utmost confidence in him when he's fulfilling both duties. For goodness sake, he created black-and-white Imax films.Excellent film. A film that shows you what a masterclass in acting looks like. Expect this to clean up at all the awards. One of my favorite films I've seen all year. I found it so intriguing. I have to say it was devastating and a travesty how ""Oppenheimer"" was treated. Especially for showing his moral compass was still intact. Anyways I give this film five mor fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin

"The Movie is good overall, but my talk about the notes and negatives, which they are:First I wish they had more scenes of the effects of the bomb on people and showed the human tragedy that happened. They showed part of it, but in my opinion it is not nearly enough compare to the scale of the event, as I was on the verge of crying in these scenes, and I think it would be better if the abomination of the actual event was presented in a larger way.The second thing is that the Movie is over switching between timelines, which made tracking the events very difficult, especially at the beginning, and there are no clear indications or hints to inform the viewer about what time the scene is taking place.Except for that the movie is great, but I think I need a second watch."
"In my opinion, Oppenheimer is most likely the best movie we will watch in this decade. Everything about it is so beautifully handcrafted. To think this movie uses 0 cgi is mind blowing to me. The story is not boring at all; for three hours my eyes were stuck to the screen and not for a single moment I was tired or checked my phone. Oh yes, of course, if possible watch it on the biggest screen possible. But just please go watch the movie you will not be disappointed!Ludwig Göransson went above and beyond with the score. My chest and my soul were shaking and felt satisfied after feeling such beautiful score. Chris Nolan has outdone himself!"
"It is very long, unnecessarily. There are too many irrelevant scenes, too many time jumps that don't help to the development of the film. I'm interested in the subject, and that helped me not to fall asleep, but it could be explained all that in half of the time.And, in all that time, it seems that the development of the bomb was an easy job. You can watch ""Shadow makers"" to see this in detail. It's a better film, from my point of view.I will not explain much more, but at the end, like in many American films, the developer of a weapon that could be considered by itself a war crime, it's not prosecuted by a government who wished use this weapon to dominate the world, but by a man who hated him for personal reasons. Remember, the system works! (repeat it, if you need it).How different would it have been, if it was the nazis, or the soviets, the ones depicted in the film! (a man trapped in an evil system...)"
"I was excited to watch a Christopher Nolan movie on a big screen for the first time. I'm glad, there is no IMAX near my location as it would've been a complete waste of money.This movie is an ATOMIC mess. Story is being told in a non-linear fashion which has become the norm these days but that made it more confusing. There were no subtitles and most of the times due to changing accents and speaking very slowly it became very hard to understand what they were saying at all.You don't feel ANYTHING about ANYONE. Women come and go like a flu. What was their purpose in the movie and Oppenheimer also had one of the most bizarre sex scene I've ever seen. Oppenheimer's wife's character is so badly written it's laughable. You don't understand anyone's intentions.Movies dealing with science are going to be complicated that's a given fact but they made it more complicated than it needed to be.I don't understand how are critics rating this movie so highly. This movie is not for an average audience that's what that implies."
"The film is a study of the genius mind of Oppenheimer. The first third covers his character at a good speed, from his ways of being a womanizer to balancing it with his immersion into the Quantum Universe. The 2nd third of the movie focuses on him being onboarded into one of the world's costliest govt projects: The Manhattan Project overlooked by Leslie Groves played by Matt Damon. We see the successful testing of the bomb in the 2nd half along with the laying of the same in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.We might think the film would focus on the completion of the grandest project. However, this is where it shifts gears and becomes a courtroom drama with a tug of war and some power plays.The film is a brilliant study of the conflict in the human mind on whether to explore the pursuit of passions or repress them if they stand in the way of your morals.Many pointed out that the film is slow in parts. I only found it too fast leaving no breathing room. One scene after another, there is always something developing. Because of its long first half before the interval, you got to take care of your loo breaks as the movie with its high speed spilled interesting details across the timeline, you cannot afford to lose a minute. I detested the blaring music used for dramatic scenes in the initial parts of the film but over time the music reduces and also goes completely void at times. I still believe Nolan over-uses the strength of the background score, almost taking it to noisy levels. The dialogues are sharp yet real.Nolan's films are notorious for their exposition-spewing scenes and cliched heroic moments. However, it is much subtler this time. I never thought Matt Damon could act weak, but with Cillian Murphy living his performance, he seemed slightly out of touch. RDJ might have been overshadowed by the glowing reviews that have come for Cillian, but I think he has delivered one of the most career-defining characters. The wife of Oppenheimer has a unique character arc that is wonderfully brought to the screen by Emily Blunt who I believe is one of the best actresses of the current generation exhibiting great versatility with Edge of Tomorrow, Sicario, A Quiet Place and the more recent Mary Poppins.This is not for everyone, it's too talky in parts but talky like The Social Network. These dialogues are worth paying attention to because they're leading to somewhere interesting. Many dialogues also get diluted with heavy BGM, issue that has been noticed with past Nolan films like Tenet and TDKR. You have to lip read there but missing them don't really confuse you as it did with Tenet.Another interesting thing to note is how many stars have been treated like no bigger than the characters of the film. Emily Blunt is sitting behind Cillian in interrogation room while she's almost out of focus. She is smartly brought to focus after her character emerges. Nolan has played some genius moves here. The Oscar winning Casey Affleck comes for a super short scene and disappears. I prefer the camera work of Hoyte (who's the new regular for Nolan) over his previous regular Wally Pfister who had a much cleaner take on shots.It is a very complete film that executes all the parts beautifully to bring an overwhelming poetic closure with a metaphorical visual spectacle."
"There's a point in the second half, right after the interval when an eye piercing flash, golden flames, followed by an earth shattering sound send tremors through the behemoth theatre where I watched this film. All eyes glued to the screen, some sighing out of the wonder that they had just witnessed. That recreation of a milestone moment in US and world history that changed the course of the World War II and the world order in general has been able handled by the brilliant hands of Christopher Nolan. Those five minutes or so truly stand out as one of the most epic moments in cinema history and in the Nolan universe in general.Nolan's collaboration with a long-term associate Cillian Murphy is a stuff of cinematic brilliance. Murphy, who had proven himself as a reputable actor through his performances in the television giant ""Peaku Blinders"" and in shorter roles in films like ""Dunkirk"" and ""Inception"", was the perfect choice for the protagonist in the eponymous film. He executes every scene, every emotion with a sheer brilliance that we have come to expect of him. Murphy effectively brings to the screen a brilliant mind, an enigma to his associates, a man torn between responsibilities to his country and to mankind, a man willing to rip off all strength from Nazi Germany using the atom bombs but unsure whether using them on Japan serves the cause any longer, a man who has to wear the medal of a scientific genius and America's hero but be bigger down by an aching sense of guilt over the immediate and long-term catastrophic effect that his invention has led to. An Oscar nomination and a potential win is on the cards.It has been rightly pointed out again and again that underneath all the science and physics and time travel, Nolan's ventures have an emotional core, tied to a guilt-ridden or guilt-driven protagonist. Nolan has mounted ""Oppenheimer"" on a massive scale but he never let the emotions get suppressed under the grandeur. There are scenes that will shake your emotional core. He is ably supported by a plethora of talented artists: Hoyte van Hoytema's black and white and colour frames facilitated in building up a top-notch ambience for the project; Ludwig Göransson's score took the film to a different level, his music is haunting with an inherent sense of urgency, anxiety-inducing, and prophetic of an imminent catastrophe; the sound designers took the film to greater heights befitting a story on the father of the atom bomb. Nolan is known for using practical effects and he mounts those effects exceptionally in the Trinity testing scene at Los Alamos. It has been evident now and again that he is a creative genius and with ""Oppenheimer"" he delivers a groundbreaking film cementing his status further. He also took full control of the screenplay this time and it doesn't falter for a moment. Three hours went by without a twitch. Nolan has hardly made a film with a linear narrative, a rule he doesn't break in ""Oppenheimer"" and Thank God he didn't as a chronological narration would have defeated everything that the screenplay and the editing of this film have achieved.The film rides high on Murphy and Nolan's shoulders but it would be unfair to not give a shout out to the supporting cast. Robert Downey Jr. In an unrecognisable make-up is viciously good as a bureaucrat willing to make it big in the US Senate and makes waves, particularly in the last act. Emily Blunt is effortlessly brilliant in the few scenes that she has and so is Florence Pugh. The latter casts a stronger impact in her limited screentime. Matt Damon does well as an officer in the US Army and also gets to deliver some comic relief. The rest of the supporting cast gave their best throughout.""Oppenheimer"" is not about the science of it all. You won't get to see the actual creation of the atom bombs or their application on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. You get to see the world around its creation, application and consequence through the lenses of Robert Oppenheimer. The science and horror of it all and the resultant consequence that US politics has on the creator of these bombs become palpable through the exceptional direction of Nolan and the cast and crew. It is a team effort that didn't go wrong."
"As I sat in the emptied auditorium reflecting on the movie and would begin my car ride home. One word kept popping in my head, ""awe struck,"" but not of the film but rather of the history the film is portraying.In my high school days, my favorite subject was history, and my favorite subject in history was World War II. I would soak up any knowledge I could get my hands on, and whatever was taught in class was never enough. I always wanted to learn more. Although one part of World War II history that I never looked twice at was the Manhattan project. For some odd reason, the atomic bomb never quite interested me... until I saw this film.This film left me with a lot of thoughts that I will to the best of my ability compact and literate in this review.I will start by stating that if you know anything about me, then you will know how much of a die-hard fan I am of Christopher Nolan. I damn near worship the ground he walks on, I would hail him as the single best director of our time or the DaVinci of filmmaking. But I have recently promised myself that I would judge Nolan's works with the same subjectivity and objectivity as I would any other filmmaker despite my strong feelings towards the man. With that being said, it brings me no pleasure to say I found Oppenheimer rather underwhelming.So before I get into my reasoning for why I will first mention the positives of this film...Nolan brings together a star-studded cast. The cast is just tremendously stacked, and everyone involved gave great performances. With Cillian Murphy as Robert Oppenheimer leading this incredible ensemble. One thing I've always loved about Nolan is how he works a lot with the same actors from previous projects. If Murphy doesn't win or isn't at least nominated for best actor in a leading role, then that would be a crime.The story is strong, the writing is great, the cinematography is great, sound design, and score both great. Everything I would come to expect from a Nolan film is all here. Though I must say I am genuinely looking forward to Nolan reuniting with Hans Zimmer. While I did enjoy the score from Ludwig Goransson, I still felt the absence of the unique touch that Zimmer always brought to a Nolan production.But where I struggle the most with this film is the structure and how Nolan would tell this story. We would jump back and forth a lot between Oppenheimers hearing to his early days as a student, then back to the hearing to go back to his days on the Manhattan project to the hearing and etc... you get my point. It's all this jumping around that never let me feel settled. It's also this jumping around that I feel prevents the film from finding sure footing. As well as contributing to my inability to attach myself to this fantastic ensemble cast of characters because the characters weren't always there and are constantly fleeting. I really wish Nolan would've stuck to a linear timeline of storytelling here as I think it would've been a far better way to experience this narrative than the timeline jumping we are presented with.Also, the nudity and scenes of sexuality also felt, at least to me, unecessary and not needed. Now I love to look at a beautiful woman as much as the next guy especially if she's Florence Pugh but it added in my opinion nothing to the film and if it wasn't there I don't think it would've affected anything. That also includes Florence Pughs' character in general, I love Pugh she's a great actress, but she just seemed so wasted and unnecessary here.The emotion never really hit me either, except for three sequences. The film hit me the most during the trinity test, the ensuing celebration of the success of said test, then the eventual bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I feel I must stress this that the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not seen. They are touched upon during a radio broadcast.This is where I would like to discuss those sequences because out of this 3 hour film outside of these three sequences, the film didn't quite grip me as past Nolan films have. But I must say these three sequences left me with a strong bitter sweet emotion, and I will definitely give Nolan praise for doing this. I don't know if anyone else in the auditorium felt this way, but I know it affected me for sure.The trinity bomb test was incredible and such a intense sequence even though we obviously already knew the outcome of said test it was still terrifying and how Nolan captured the incredible blast was a spectacle to behold on the big screen.After the ensuing success of the Trinity bomb, Nolan captured a scene of celebration, though in my heart and mind, I felt no such thing. The fact that they have succeeded in building this bomb and successfully detonated it left me with a sense of alarm. This great destructive power now not only exists but is fully armed and ready. I felt utterly overwhelmed with the feeling that this destructive force should never be in the hands of man. But unfortunately we live in an imperfect world and at the time we found ourselves in a place when it was needed.Then, the third sequence where Oppenheimer gives a speech upon the bombings of Japan. It was incredibly well done by Nolan and acted to perfection by Murphy. The cheers and the applause from the crowd as Oppenheimer tried his best to keep his composure as he began feeling the destructive cost of what he unleashed upond the world. The sequence was very heartbreaking and brought me to tears as I thought of the actual history of this moment. It was again very bitter sweet as it brought an end to the war but would also bring about the opening of another.Nonetheless, I fervently believe the war in the Pacific would not have ended when it did, if not for the atomic bomb. The Japanese were fierce in their fighting and I think would have never surrendered until as they mentioned in the film we would have taken the Island of Japan and God only knows how many lives that would have cost.Lastly, I will say this is a very purposeful, slow paced, heavy dialogue, story driven film, so it is, and I can not stress this enough, not for everyone. I would say that unless you have a heavy interest in history, this film may not be for you. Also, this film is more biopic than it is historical drama, which I was not prepared for, but that didn't really impact my score, just something I failed to anticipate.Furthermore I genuinely hope audience members don't treat this as a normal outing to the cinema and actual take the time to think upon the actual history this film portrays and to reflect upon the immense power and devastation that these weapons cause. While my finger or yours may never touch the button it's important that we as American citizens are responsible enough to elect true God fearing men and women to the oval office who will fear and respect the power of these weapons.Well, this review went on longer than I anticipated, so if you read all this, then I thank you for your time.So I will wrap this up in saying this film is being hailed as Nolan's best from multiple outlets and is receiving outstanding scores from viewers. But I just can't fully agree. The most I would say is this film is far from his worst but not his best.Irregardless, I very much look forward to Nolan's next film in the next three to four years.PS. Perhaps after a second viewing, I can increase my score, but for now, I'm confident in my rating.IMDb: 8/10
Letterboxd: 4/5Watched in Theaters."
"The second best movie from christopher nolan, but if you an action boy please dont watch it this movie is a masterpiece and it dosent contain the action you want. Cillian Murphy that's one of the best performance i've ever seen and everyone watched the film will confirm this .I want to praise the sound effects of the movie, they are from another world and make you fit into the movie in an indescribable way.And I strongly recommend that you watch the movie on an imax screen. I know that you will say that it is not worth it, but after you watch the movie, you will thank meIn the end this movie is the best biographical film of all time."

"I wanted to watch this on the release day, but my brother wanted to watch it with me and he said he will take some time. So, my friend saw it on the release day and told me it's the worst movie he ever saw, but I knew better than to believe him, and said that he might not have understood the movie since this is the first movie of Nolan he watches.I've seen it yesterday on 11:00 pm on IMAX, and I never even felt of sleepiness. It was always gripping, thrilling, and the music is one of the best I ever heard in a movie my entire life, even better than interstellar. The plot twist is the best executed plot twist in a movie, even though it might have not been the best plot twist specifically, but the execution made it the best for me, the music when (spoiler here) they revealed Strauss never liked Oppenheimer was literally the best as well.If you claim to not have liked the movie, go watch it again on IMAX and try to focus, because if you haven't liked it, you didn't even understand what was going on."
"Oppenheimer is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan, based on the book American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. It stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who led the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, and explores his personal and professional life, his moral dilemmas, and his legacy.Oppenheimer is a fascinating and impressive film with an incredibly visceral pacing to it. It is a testament to Nolan's vision and craftsmanship, as well as Murphy's acting prowess. The direction, editing, sound, cinematography... everything in this is just top tier. It is a film that is certainly worth watching for its cinematic achievements and its exploration of the human condition in the face of scientific discovery and moral dilemma."
"The combination of Christopher Nolan, Cillian Murphy and Ludwig Gorranson without any doubt leads to the very best, which it did. Amazing, excellent, best qualities if every element in cinema. A movie made by a genius. The music is so good, other gorransin's works i had heard were book of boba fett and mandalorian, unique . This one also is really excellent. It was great seeing cillian on big screen after peaky blinders. As usual, at his best. Mat damon and robert downey were amazing. Emily blunt. They really worked as a team and created this memory long lasting movie . Bravo, i really enjoyed it and recommend it to everyone."
"The first hour and a half felt like a fast paced movie trailer, not the actual movie. I kept waiting for the intense music and the fast scenes changing to stop, but it just didn't. It was very chaotic and made it rather hard to remember characters and get a deeper understanding of interpersonal relationships. For example, we were shown that Oppenheimer had a complicated romantic relationship with a communist woman but as an audience we never got to experience it with them, and thus, it just felt flat. I guess, the fast pacing was supposed to represent the countdown to the detonation but it was just extremely annoying to follow.Then, we have the biggest letdown of the movie - the atomic bomb, which definitely needed CGI, and I even wondered if that was THE THING that was so widely advertised. I was waiting for the movie to show Heroshima or Nagasaki and hoped that maybe there we will see the THE THING. But no. There wasn't a spectacular bomb detonation.The movie after that becomes just extremely slow paced.Another big letdown is the IMAX experience. It was so widely advertised that we HAVE to see it on the biggest screen possible but the truth is, the IMAX screen doesn't add anything to the movie. It can be just as easily watched on a smaller screen and it would feel the exact same way.The idea is great, the moral undertones are what is expected from a movie about the atom bomb, but the execution is just... disappointing. It sparks good conversations but the movie experience is just not enjoyable."
"I was expecting there to be more about the development of the bombs. One thing I was certain was going to be in the movie, for example, was not even mentioned: tickling the dragon's tail. That is the sort of content I was hoping for in this movie. If you are not familiar with this, do a search for Slotin, Daghlian, and tickling the dragon's tail. Essentially, what Slotin did was to carefully move two hemispheres of nuclear material ever so slightly closer together in an attempt to see what happens just before criticality. Oops! Yeah, major oops. I suppose these things weren't include because they actually happened after Hiroshima and Nagasaki by which time the movie was mostly over. That's fair, I guess. Still, that is the type of thing I was hoping for.Instead, what was shown was basically a soap opera. And the music was annoying. Music is masterfully done in such movies as the Star Wars movies, where the music plays a large role in the production value of the film. Here, though, it's mostly used to fill dead air. Almost all dialog in the movie is nearly overwhelmed by meaningless music. I think the movie would have been far better with at least half the music removed entirely. Let us hear what people are actually saying.I can't fault the acting. It was superb."
"This movie was a great one directed by someone who in my opinion is one of the best directors of our time. The story was very well timed and payed out with the development of all of the characters and their relationships with each other.Before this movie I did not know anything about the man who the movie is named after but, now after seeing it I am drawn to conduct some research on him and his work from that time period. Chris Nolan's does an incredible job unrolling and unfolding the plot and twists without allowing his audience to know or expect what's coming next. In my opinion this film may be up for and win the title of Best picture this year at the Oscars."
"This might be Christopher Nolan's most personal movie yet and it's absolutely brilliant.It chronicles the life of Robert Oppenheimer who is regarded as the father of the atomic bomb.The film occurs in 3 timelines- One showing a closed security hearing initiated against Oppenheimer to remove his security clearanceOne showing Oppenheimer's days as a student in Germany, then becoming a professor in Berkeley & finally becoming the head of the Manhattan project which made the atom bombs that were deployed on Hiroshima & Nagasaki to end the 2nd world war.The 3rd timeline is about Strauss's hearing to become the Secretary of Commerce by using Oppenheimer as a pawn by proving that he was a communist spy but the hearing backfires on him.The performances are brilliant especially by Cilian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. & Matt Damon.The movie is much more than just the Trinity tests & the Japan bombings but also about the politics of the World War, Cold War and the lethal use of science in geopolitics.We see all the famous scientists like Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, Lawrence,Teller, Feynman in fascinating,interesting cameos.The only flaw in the film I would say is that the first half is a bit slow but other than that, it's absolutely perfect.The movies last lines spoken by Einstein to Oppenheimer are so true & fascinating-""Eventually they will celebrate you, but it won't be for you but for them""It's one of Nolan's best films and will be regarded as one of the most important films ever made.👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
"Wow, just wow. This will go down as one of the best films of the decade. The direction and screenplay is phenomenal by Nolan and it's about time he gets an Oscar for it.The cinematography is great and the music is brilliant. Ludwig has had some great soundtracks of late and he continues that trend.Acting is top notch of all actors and I would surprised if RDJ and Cillian Murphy don't get nominated at least.There has been so many great films this year which I have enjoyed in their own way however so far there is only one best picture winner and that is Oppenheimer.Watching in imax was incredible and truly shows Nolan as one of our finest directors of the 21st Century."
"First off, some absolutely stand out performances. The ensemble cast was excellent. Cillian Murphy and Matt Damon were excellent (I am absolutely here for post action hero Damon!). The score is also beautiful.I think my only critique for the film comes from how little focus was put on the sheer devastation these bombs caused. I think it would have given another element and potentially somewhat of an understanding to Oppenheimer's moral position for why the H bomb should not be created. I think it would have given a bit more perspective on just how big of a deal these bombs were.That said, great film and keen to watch it a second time. I always find Nolan films more interesting the second time around."
"I just had to share my thoughts on ""Oppenheimer."" In my opinion, it is hands down the best film of 2023 so far, truly ending the first half of the year with a bang. For the past three months, I've been yearning for some quality content, but most movies have been either too commercial or just plain lackluster.The wait for ""Oppenheimer"" was completely worthwhile, and I won't spoil the plot for you in this review. It's a biopic about the father of the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer, but what sets it apart is Christopher Nolan's exceptional treatment of the subject matter. This is far from a popcorn flick; it delves deep into character study, making you feel like you're inside Oppenheimer's head, experiencing what he goes through. It's a guilt trip for a scientist who created something that changed the world forever and how we are at fingertip/button away from explosion.I must say, Nolan outdid himself in many scenes, making this, in my opinion, his best work as a director to date. The second half, especially after the trinity test, had some of my favorite moments, with the court drama unfolding brilliantly, and the ending haunting and thought-provoking.The screenplay was brilliantly executed, presented from a first-person perspective that allowed me to deeply invest in Oppenheimer's character and yearn to learn more about him. Nolan's choice in this aspect was reminiscent of his earlier film ""Memento.""The cast was outstanding, with Robert Downey Jr. Delivering a surprising and impressive performance, especially after his role in ""Zodiac."" Cillian Murphy was a force to be reckoned with, as always, and even Gary Oldman as Truman and the special mentions to Jeana did an excellent job.The music, composed by Ludwig, was simply mind-blowing. I was already awestruck by his work in ""Tenet,"" and now he brings an amazing score to ""Oppenheimer"" that haunts and adds an eerie atmosphere to the film.This movie is screenplay-heavy and demands attention to detail. Experiencing it in IMAX is highly recommended, particularly for the trinity test scene, which is mind-blowing. But it's not a film for those seeking heavy CGI and dramatic theater experiences. So, if that's what you're expecting, it's best to avoid it.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" will leave you deep in thought and silence for quite a while after watching it. It's an emotional rollercoaster that leaves a lasting impact."
"With over 1,900 reviews, do you need another one?For me this movie was better than most for the first two thirds, and then was in a class all of its own the last third. The last hour of this movie will astound you. The thoughts expressed are very, well thought provoking, like so much so that you want to see the movie again, and maybe again after that.The parts that got me the most were the celebration after the bomb worked, and after the bomb was used. It reminded me of the scene in ""Come and See"" when the church full of people was burning down and the Einsatzgruppen were celebrating their accomplishment of extermination.Also, what Einstein tells Oppenheimer which are almost the last words of the film blow you away. I don't know if this insight was in the book or an insight by Nolan, but it hits your soul.I will have to see this film at least three times, not in IMAX (only the last five minutes are IMAX worthy) but for the insights presented. It is a thoughtful film, rare for this time, that requires contemplation.Particularly now with Joe Biden egging the Russians on in Ukraine. He forgets, the Russians defeated Napoleon, the Russians defeated Hitler, the Russians know war, and the Russians know death by radiation poisoning. America knows nothing of war, it is always in another country. Let Joe know he is a total idiot because the Russians can deal with a nuclear war, America cannot."
"It is evident that Christopher Nolan is the father of genius cinema. The way he created coloured scenes and black n white scenes together to display that the world is not the same after creation of the deadly weapon.The story is gripping and goes through the life of Oppenheimer with highs and lows, defining his character in every aspect of life.The curosity to go ahead and test the bomb faster than Germans, communist Russian angle makes the Oppenheimer unique and multidimensional, of course the reference from Bhagwat Geeta - now I am the death...gives goosebumps and reminds us of the Mahabharat war where before the war Sri Krishna shows gigantic form to Arjun. It is not a coincidence that there were deadly nuclear or more advanced weapons used back then before that knowledge was vanished from humans.The only negative about the movie could be that it is a screenplay and dialog heavy film and not for everyone. It could be shorten by 15-20 mins to make it more power packed."
"Being one of my most anticipated films of 2023, I wasn't disappointed.Christopher Nolan is an interesting filmmaker as his works on ""Memento, Insomnia, The Dark Knight, and Dunkirk"" are awesome. While not all of his films are amazing, Nolan has proven himself to be a good director who provides interesting concepts, styles and ideas throughout. Here, Oppenheimer is really great. Nolan continues to achieve success with his directing style as Oppenheimer contains great camerawork, visual and sound presentations, dialogue and strong performances from the cast members. Throughout, the camerawork was really good as the uses of black and white and color felt purposeful and unique. With Nolan being excellent at sound design, the sound design and many of the technical aspects were really good as it helps add to the empty time period and conflicted atmosphere. Many of the performances from the cast members were excellent as their performances were strong and helped to build personality on their characters with some great make-up and costumes.The writing for the narrative is pretty good as the story about Opprenheimer and the dramatic elements surrounding him and his works were pretty interesting as it felt engaging and intriguing to observe. Most of the characters were pretty interesting with their dynamics, personalities and purposes. Despite the sound design being good, there were certain moments of the sound design that were distracting which made some of the dialogue moments difficult to hear and including an illusion nudity sequence that was pretty cringeworthy.But overall, it's great."
"This movie is like if Terrence Mallick remade interstellar. It feels like the worse Nolan movie from a major studio. Watching it gave the experience of watching a three hour trailer. The non-linear storyline was interesting, and the movie is beautiful from a technical filmmaking standpoint but the story felt tired. The majority of the acting performances are top notch, with one exception, Emily Blunt, bless her heart is very inconsistent and stands out as the bottom of this illustrious class. By the end of the film I was waiting for the end card and this longing was not helped by the all too common terrible theater educate."
"If you are planning to buy tickets for Oppenheimer from an entertainment point of view, DON'T. This is a rather exhaustive deep-dive into the personality of Oppenheimer. It has got nothing much to do with the Manhattan Project and the Trinity Test.Also, all the hype about - go watch it in IMAX - fails when you are done watching the movie. A major part of the movie is all talk-talk-talk so all you get to see on that giant screen are close-up of actors and their aging face wrinkles and blemishes. Except for a few scenes of Los Alamos there is nothing here.The no-CGI Trinity Test scene build up tension with plenty of background score but when you watch it on screen it just passes.The screenplay as usual jumps frantically and therefore it can get confusing if you don't pay attention.At least I'm not going for a Nolan movie next time in a theatre."
"This is the pinnacle of modern filmmaking; everything from the stacked cast, the acting, the cinematography, the brooding score, and the editing all shines through and immerses you into the world of Julius Robert Oppenheimer. It's the culmination of Nolan's success; everything he's achieved has led to this moment, and my goodness, what a beautiful, haunting ride it was. It captivates you from the very first frame and doesn't release you from its vice-like grip until the end, leaving you speechless, in awe, and haunted by what you experienced.This is Nolan's magnum opus, and the timing couldn't have come at a more opportune moment. It's a film that everybody NEEDS to watch. You'll walk out of the cinema a changed person, guaranteed."
"Oppenheimer is simply an instant classic. It's difficult to follow in some moments, for sure but once you step out of the cinema, you realize it was worth it. Shocking, stressful, but mostly interesting. Every dialogue counts, every piece of historical insight is interesting. And the acting, just wow. This cast is so crazy that if you are not informed of the actors, you just keep getting surprised. I have to admit I'm not impressed by the filmmaking and the IMAX format and so on, but by the feelings this film produces. We will all leave the theaters stressed, because we now we live in a world in the brink of war, with nuclear deterrence playing a key role in keeping a ""Hot Peace"" but we can't fathom enough how dark and regretful the episode that the movie narrates was for human kind. Chapeau to Nolan, he delivered a movie for ages.PS: Get ready for Robert Downey's Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor."
"This film is made for the big screen. The sound design and cinematography are so good that it's a physical experience that left me with goosebumps.That said, it is an exhausting one. You feel the 3 hours and my adrenaline recovery took some time from the long build up which was, however, expertly delivered. Again, this is why this film was made for the big screen.There is some great acting, particularly from Cillian Murphy and with some surprisingly cameos - it's certainly one of Nolan's best works.The score is also worth mentioning, dropping his usual collaboration with Hans Zimmer, it was more minimalistic, gritty and perfectly interwoven with the storyline.If you plan on seeing Oppenheimer, get to the cinema if you can."
"It is difficult to explain my feeling after watching the movie, especially in an IMAX experience ... The Cinematography is incredible and the acting is beyond the professional from all the actors and actresses, as if you went back in time to watch the events... In every moment of the movie there is a story of creativity ... I have watched dozens of documentaries from the period of World War II, and several of them were about the nuclear bomb and Oppenheimer, but this film was more than excellent at delivering events with all suspense and without any complicated dialogues.... A wonderful cinematic work that we will always remember, and as history remembered Oppenheimer and his apex addition to humanity.... The film carries a valuable message to everyone who watches it and adds to the world of cinema a lot of genius and beauty... It is rare for me to give a rating of 10 to a movie in my life. Perhaps I gave a rating of 10 to 5 movies in my life, and this is the sixth of them... With all happiness, I am proud that I lived in the time when I was able to attend this movie in the cinema on the firt day .... And perhaps I will watch it more than once without getting bored ... Thanks to everyone who worked on producing this masterpiece, and thank you ... Thank you Oppenheimer for all you have done for humanity ."
"Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan returning to the absolute peak of his craft. You can say the same about Cillian Murphy, who delivers a performance that will hopefully be discussed or even studied in the years to come.The success of this film mostly lies on him, and what helps the star shine is the ensemble supporting cast. Nolan, with his tight screenplay and intimate direction, is able to get career-best performances out of Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, Josh Harnett, with an understated David Krumholtz and the limited screen precense of Kenneth Branagh.Editor Jennifer Lane's work allows Oppenheimer to jump from scene to scene, time to time, actor to actor ever so seamlessly. Nolan's one of two expertises displayed here is his significant use of time jumps. Sometimes the jump cuts in this film are excessively overwhelming. This might be an unconventional comment, but I enjoyed Oppenheimer best when it slows down to present a long conversation. Some scenes of the trial and testimony is tense because it allows the rapid-fire dialogue to flow naturally.And then the shattering sequence of bomb detonation arrives. It is a breathless few minutes. The audience were staring at the gigantic IMAX 70mm screen with culminating intensity. The other expertise of Nolan's is how he handles sound design. Sure, sometimes the audio is so bombastic that we feel the explosion in our core, but it is sometimes the alternative scenes with absolute silence that we feel the most effect of.As far as the plot goes, those who are invested in it might figure out some historical details that are missing, or that the subplot about the character Oppenheimer's personal life (with Blunt and Florence Pugh) feels half-baked. But as viewers, it won't take long until one realizes that Oppenheimer isn't simply a movie about making the atomic bomb. This character film is fundamentally about a man coming to terms with being the person solely giving people the power to destroy the world. Cinema is a powerful medium, and Oppenheimer uses it to its full extent to deliver a harrowing story that leaves us stunned."
"By far Christopher Nolan's best written movie to date! Oh man just the dialogue alone gets you going. You add in these new crispy black and white IMAX scenes. Such a fun movie with so much anticipation. The characters are all so layered and all the actors do a fantastic job (kudos to casting.) Fastest 3 hours for a movie experience I'm still waiting for Killers of the Flower Moon and Napoleon, but this is the front runner for best picture. I have so much respect for Christopher Nolan not just as one of the best film makers of all time, but just being loyal. I would be shocked if Cullen Murphy does not win the Oscar this year. Still a few more movies to come out but this was a damn good movie! Great time for cinema! At least 4 great movies in theaters right now. Please go out and support!"
"I saw Oppenheimer tonight, July 21, 2023 with my two adult children. We all enjoyed the movie very much, and the story was wonderfully told and beautifully shot. There were excellent performances by Cillian Murphy, as J. Robert Oppenheimer, and Robert Downey, Jr., as Lewis Strauss, and Emily blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer, and a tremendous and talented supporting cast as well.Though somewhat nonlinear, the story is divided into three primary parts: Oppenheimer's life before the Manhattan Project, during the Manhattan Project, and after the Manhattan Project. The scenes from Oppenheimer's early life focused on his unique vision and exceptional intelligence, and the scenes of his post-project life focused on his blacklisting and discrediting that he endured, because he dared to question the direction the United States was taking with regard to nuclear weapons.The part of his story that was arguably the most well-known, his supervision of the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, contained the most interesting and compelling scenes. Even though everyone in the audience knows that the Trinity atomic bomb test was successful, the dramatic tension in the film leading up to that point, was wonderfully built and stretched almost to the breaking point. The explosion itself, which we had really been looking forward to, was less-impressive than expected, but the sound design made the post-explosion shockwave frighteningly real in the theater. (This also serves as an apt metaphor for the development of nuclear weapons: the explosion itself does not last very long, but the shockwaves reverberated far beyond the flash of light.The sex scenes were unnecessary and gratuitous. While reportedly shown to help the audience understand Oppenheimer the man, the film had plenty of opportunities to show his lack of faithfulness for his or other peoples' marriages. However, only his relationship with Florence Pugh's character (Jean Tatlock) was told with explicit sexual activity. The film made it clear that Oppenheimer had illicit relationships with two married women, one of whom he got pregnant and subsequently married, but only his relationship with Tatlock was depicted with graphic nudity and simulated sexual acts. The scenes really detracted from the overall quality of the movie, especially since one of them featured Oppenheimer's most often-quoted line, ""I have become Death, the destroyer of worlds."" That line should have been one of the most powerful moments in the movie, but connecting it with unnecessary nudity significantly detracted from the strength and power of the quote.The third act, detailing the parallel proceedings in the Senate confirmation hearing of Lewis Strauss and the kangaroo court which tortuously denied Oppenheimer's security clearance, went on far too long. The only saving grace was the surprise performance by the otherwise-underutilized Rami Malek as Dr. David Hill.The attention to historical detail was quite impressive, and several characters and scenes which would in any other movie be fictitious, were actually very closely-based on real people and situations. For science geeks like myself, it was quite a thrill seeing Richard Feynman, Neils Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Edward Teller, Enrico Fermi, etc. Brought to life. Tom Conti as Einstein was a bit of mis-casting, as Conti lacked the appearance and gravitas and humor of the real Einstein.For performances and cinematography, I would score this a perfect 10. However, I deducted two stars for the unnecessary sex scenes, and for the agonizingly-prolonged courtroom-style drama of the third act. I strongly recommend that people go see it, but I know that due to the bleakness and harsh reality of the movie's overall message, I will not go back to see it again."
"This is how to make a biopic of a complex historical figure without boring the audience! Oppenheimer is my most favourite Nolan's movie so far.The chemistry between the actors is unbelievable, and the visuals are stunning. It's not just wide open spaces of New Mexico, but even elementary particles when Oppenheimer talks about them.I have to say that after the first part where everyone was a Marxist intellectual, the military were a welcome change. The secondary characters are as memorable as the leads. Everyone praises Murphy's performance for a good reason, but Matt Damon's Groves steals the show as a reluctant bridge between the two worlds on a cat-herding assignment gambling an enormous amount on money in the middle of a war. Brief but ominous appearance of Casey Affleck's Boris Pash is probably one of best parts of the movie. Also memorable, even if small, is Tom Conti's Einstein, with his bit of wisdom, and President Truman, played by unrecognizable Gary Oldman.One gripe I'm sure I'm not the only one having: after Tenet, you'd think Nolan would fix his sound problems. Most of the time the dialogue is audible, but there are still parts where I caught myself thinking, ""what did he just say?"""
"This in the minds of most critics is cinematic gold. The casting, score, set pieces, and direction is some of the finest in the business. The cinematography is out've this world. A beautifully shot film from start to finish.With all that being said, I have to gripe for the standard moviegoer. This is a long winded film. A lot going on with a mediocre payoff. I believe genuine interest in the subject matter is of key importance. WW2 has always interested me but this was just a little to drawn out for my taste.It is a movie about a renowned scientist so if science isn't that interesting to you this may be worth a pass. In regards to film making this isn't lacking. If you're looking for a slam bang action flick with bombs galore look away. This is just a well done biopic through and through.I am happy I saw this film, I just won't be in any hurry to see it again. It almost felt an hour to long. To each their own. Check it out!"
"I have no worldly idea who is giving this film mega stars!!!!????? The film has so many flaws; the number one being the star-studded (NOT) cast! Did everyone take downers before shooting the scenes? I've never experienced such a boring film with so many quality actors. Dear Lord! Also, the writing was messed up! Some of it was technical but most of it was fluffy and watered down. There is no personality in any of the characters. The topic itself is so interesting but not anymore!!! You could not ruin a film anymore. And the black and white scenes are ridiculous. No real reason for that. It looks weird and feels weird. Finally, Cillian, I still love you but this isn't your role."
"I found the movie difficult to follow at first. I've seen ""Fat Man and Little Boy"" and ""In The Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer"" so I knew pretty much the parameters of the story.""Fat Man and Little Boy"" (with Paul Newman as General Leslie Groves) is a fairly straightforward narration of the development of the atomic bomb in the New Mexico desert. ""In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer"" a 1968 stage play by Heinar Kipphardt about the security clearance taken away from J. Robert Oppenheimer, for his sympathies for the Communist Party, by Lewis Straus; I believe it became a PBS production. So, I had a fairly good background in the story. I thought to myself, as the movie unfolded with numerous flashbacks, how confusing this film would be without that background information and how easily lost the audience could be.What is the subject matter of the movie is a more challenging question: is it simply about the development of a destructive bomb or is it about the moral implications of scientists developing a bomb, and their regret for being involved in development of weapons of mass destruction?The movie starts out with a quote from the Bhagavad Gita: ""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."" And Oppenheimer quotes the line with the first explosion of the atomic bomb, July 16, 1945. But there is a refrain from the get-go of the film of scientists creating such a destructive weapon. And the response that quiets the argument, ""If Hitler had such a weapon, he would not hesitate to use it."" And there is something disquieting about a background chant that to me sounded like jackboots of marching Nazis, as if to reinforce the question. Jackboots of any totalitarian state. (And what seemed unthinkable in 1945, now in 2023 so many nations own nuclear weapons, that any flash incident can end in nuclear holocaust. And North Korea insists on developing nuclear weapons for the sole purpose of destroying America.)Peace comes to Europe in May before the Atom Bomb is finalized, but war continues in Japan. Truman orders the attack on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to bring a final and forceful end to what could be a projected battle to the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives.Oppenheimer goes to Truman to bemoan the loss of life, that he feels personally responsible for; Truman is less than thrilled and never wants to see the ""crybaby"" (his words) Oppenheimer ever again.Subsequent to the war, Lewis Straus, who in reality was indeed a very vindictive, mean spirited, petty person, wants Oppenheimer's security clearance taken away for his sympathies with the American Communist Party, of which his brother Frank is also an active member.I saw the movie at San Francesco Balboa Theatre (35mm print) and they allowed for two breaks at the hour and 2-hour point of the three-hour movie. (I wouldn't detect the difference between IMax & 35 mm, ...)It is not so terribly confusing a movie, it soon follows a straightforward narrative, but it is something of a challenge to follow."
"Without the doubt, one of the biggest masterpieces of our time. Taking such a sensitive story, and tell it the best way possible. That's signature Christopher Nolan. Needless to say Cillian Murphy was incredibly convincing and accurate. Definitely deserves an Oscar! It is so hard to make a story that is based on historical facts, this interesting. Whole movie keeps you on the edge. Build up is phenomenal, waiting for July 16th 1945 and when it happens, it all make sense. Timeline is not linear and in my opinion this makes the story even more alluring as it leads the audience to think ""why does he feel the way he feels in the future"". Now I've become death, destroyer of worlds!"
"There's no need to exaggerate the brilliance of cinematography in Oppenheimer. The casting and the music indeed is top notch. The knowledge of basic atomic physics will make a huge difference to the viewers' relatability to the plot. Also the fact that Nolan has tried to elevate the humanitarian aspect of Oppenheimer using the metaphor of Promethius is absolutely brilliant.Hats off to Ludwig Göransson for that incredible and rather immersive and engaging use of music.Hats off to Cillian Murphy for that brilliant acting and indistinguishable American accent and the rest of the cast, Director and producers for an out of this world commitment.Masterpiece indeed.#OppenheimerMovie."
"The plot is fine both for insiders who roughly know the story of Oppenheimer's and some physics as well for others who just might enjoy the drama(s) evolving in a fine visual way with strong dialogues.Oppenheimer's an independent mind, thus not fit for the ""normal"" world. But his academic brillance and courage gains him trust and support within his peers, so that this Jewish Lefty gets the task of organizing the atomic bomb for Roosevelt and the United States against Hitler, one of the first mega-projects in modern times ...Hence, we have a hero's journey here, especially as some ""normal"" people might try things (no details, sorry, you have to see for yourself).Recommendation? Yes, this movie does not feel180 min. The only sad thing that it relies on music and sound too heavily for that, a distraction and disturbance not appreciated by me in general."
You'll never see a movie like this for maybe another 5 years. Why? Because of nolan.This movie was so good that I actually forgot that it was a movie at the end.The acting 10/10.The score 10/10.The cinematography 10/10.The dialogues 10/10.I've heard some mix reactions abt the movie ppl said the movie was so boring cus it's 3 hours long and js full of dialogues but ppl this is a biopic abt the man who created the atomic bomb nolan rlly wanted to get in depth w this movie and he didIf cillian murphy doesn't win an oscar for his role as oppenheimer we riot cus he deserves it and also rdj he was phenomenal def deserves supporting actor at the academy.And also the rest of the cast even the ones that had like a line still u can tell that they gave their best at it.10/10.💯
"Christopher Nolan is one of my favourite directors operating today. He makes some of the most entertaining movies in modern cinema. Even at his worst, such as with his last film Tenet, it is still way more entertaining than a majority of movies released. After the Warner Bros same-day streaming debacle they pulled; Nolan left for Universal and this is his first film with them. Does Nolan continue to deliver or has he dropped a big bomb?Cillian Murphy has been a long-time collaborator with Nolan but this is the first time he is the main lead. He is PHENOMENAL as the titular character. He gives such nuance to his performance through body language and facial expressions alone to convey the emotion of his character. It is such a breath of fresh air from the normal yelling Oscar performances you see. He is genuinely perfect at Oppenheimer and if he doesn't get a nomination for his performance then I will be fuming! One surprising aspect of watching this film was how stacked the cast truly was. There are so many well-known actors in here that I didn't even know was even in the movie. Every supporting actor is terrific in their roles, even if it was a very minor role. The biggest standout amongst the supporting actors has got to be Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss. He gives a spectacular, compelling and even frighteningly realistic performance that makes his character stand out from the crowd. It is great to see him in a non-Marvel role and knock it out of the park. If he doesn't get a nomination for the best supporting actor then I will be also fuming!This movie is 3 hours long but you won't even feel the length because of the amazing pacing. Despite being a drama, it never drags or bores you. It moves from scene to scene very quickly in a non-chronological order but you're never lost either. There are lot of scientific jargon which is to be expected as this is about the making of the nuclear bomb. However, the excellent screenplay makes these relatively understandable so that non-scientist can easily comprehend what's going on. There is some great political tension in the 3rd act as well which was handled masterfully. In terms of story, it is juggling a lot with Oppenheimer's early life, the making of the bomb and the aftermath. Despite this, Nolan does an amazing job of exploring the character of Oppenheimer which shows all aspects of him, including his flaws. The constant build-up and tension to the bomb is incredibly engaging!Ludwig Goransson, the composer of Tenet, returns for this film. His music score is wonderfully haunting with his use of violins. His music score illustrates the horror of the actions of these scientists. Hoyte van Hoytema also returns as the cinematographer. His cinematography is visually stunning and this is thanks to the practical sets, natural lighting and real locations used. On that note, the use of practical effects and no CGI is just so awesome to see. Nolan thankfully didn't use a real nuke but he still replicates it practically and it certainly shows! The realistic explosion meant it didn't take us out of the movie as you don't question the look of the explosion as it is real. When the explosion occurs, it is weirdly captivating and frightening to look at just like it was for the characters. The sound design is also a highlight as the sound of the explosion is impactful and even terrifying. The sound itself is the jump scare and it works. The only nitpick I have with this film, which is a common problem in Nolan movies is sometimes I just can't hear what the characters are saying because of the weird sound mixing. It isn't as bad here as it was in Tenet but it is still a problem.Overall, what an amazing movie from Nolan! This is a monumental and engrossing achievement from him. Nolan is one of the few directors whose name alone is enough of a reason to watch and Oppenheimer does not change that. He successfully made a 3-hour biopic drama, the most entertaining film of 2023. Oppenheimer isn't one of those Oscar-bait movies that were made to just win an Oscar. It was made to be enjoyable for everyone and that is why this film should win best picture. This is a must-watch for everyone as it is the best movie of 2023 so far!"
"An eye-opening historical epic that not only takes the audience on a character driven journey into the psychology of America's very own Prometheus, but also an inquisitive commentary that places viewers in the witness stands, whilst Nolan expertly questions the morality, and ethics, of America's power driven politics.With a keen eye for detail, delicate hands to guide, and a compassionate soul to lead, Christopher Nolan directs his latest gargantuan cinematic feat to perfection, immersing viewers in the mesmerizing beauty of auteur craftsmanship and the very art form itself, at every chance he gets.There isn't a single moment throughout its three hour runtime, where you don't feel the insurmountable scale of what is happening before your very eyes. Every frame leaps from the screen, and burrows into your mind. Every sound ripples through your core. Every thunderous bellow of Ludwig's transcendent score sears itself into your soul. It's a marvellous achievement for the magical medium of cinema.In this intricate three-hour tale, Christopher Nolan skillfully intertwines themes of inflated ego, fear, power, scientific breakthroughs, and moral dilemmas. It is, without any shadow of a doubt, Nolan's talkiest film to date, but don't let that worry you, because your attention will never wane. In fact, prepare to be entranced, for in ""Oppenheimer,"" the mesmerizing allure of Cillian Murphy's chiseled jawline intertwines seamlessly with his Oscar-worthy portrayal of the enigmatic Oppenheimer. Yet, the film's spell extends far beyond Murphy's captivating presence. As the story unfolds, you'll find yourself drawn into a captivating exploration of the profound science of morality, a riveting journey bolstered by a stellar ensemble cast, led by the sensational Robert Downey Jr. The orchestration of emotions further intensified by a compelling score and unparalleled sound design. A feast for the eyes awaits with stunning cinematography, sweeping you into the grandiose portrait of a haunted man. And remarkably, these enthralling elements converge, granting you the privilege to savor an all-encompassing cinematic experience of epic proportions.Immersed in the realm of cinematic brilliance, ""Oppenheimer"" achieves an enchanting fusion of narrative, visuals, and audio, akin to a symphony conducted to perfection. As the story unfolds, a kaleidoscope of sounds and images harmonize, gracefully transitioning through various tones and intensities, all the while gathering boundless momentum with every successive scene. The film's forceful and relentless crescendo propels the audience towards a climactic finale, leaving them captivated by the sheer artistry of this extraordinary cinematic experience.Phew... Now all of that is out the way, I can finally leg my hair down, and just express my love and gratitude for particular aspects of the film. Benny Safdie is absolutely incredible, and I'm so happy he received a - slightly - bigger role than most of the other supporting cast members. I hope to see him in many more film's as he is yet to disappoint. Josh Hartnett is having his comeback moment, and I'm all here for it. He's sensational here and people aren't talking about him enough. RDJ turns in such a fine performance, I want a spin-off with him leading it. It's easily the best, most mature piece in his filmography. He demands your attention every second he's on screen, particularly when it's told from his POV. Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography is next level - but do we really expect to get anything less than an immersive masterclass with him at the lens. The sound design is unlike anything I've ever heard or FELT - like right up in my bum cheeks, rattling its way all the way uo my spine and out of my mouth. Now, my favourite aspect of the film, and perhaps my favourite score in a long long time. I was absolutely blow away, every single time it thundered in. There were moments where I felt like I had become one with the symphonies, momentarily closing my eyes just to live in that space. You don't just listen to this score, you feel it. Nolan is a king. What he, and his remarkable cast and crew has accomplished here, is truly something special.My one and only qualm comes in the form of a nude, and absolutely stunning Florence Pugh, or rather, the two sex/nude scenes in which her character was involved. I felt they added nothing to the story, and were completely disconnected from the rest of the film. The first time was very jarring, and the second was more unnecessary than the first. To me it felt like it was the only way Nolan could notch this film up to a 15 rating, to attract an older audience. I understand Jean Tatlock played a pivotal part in Oppenheimer's life, I just wish she was incorporated into the story in a more natural way, that fitted with the rest of the film. However, this minor discrepancy can be forgiven, considering the many gleeming aspects outweigh the one."
"Finally, another Christopher Nolan film. I always look forward to going to the cinema and once again he didn't disappoint. After Tenet, which I thought was really hard to understand, this was a treat. Well made with good moments and made even better by the fact that it is history. I was sucked in right from the start as the various cuts that followed were nice and overall it grabbed me right from the start. I enjoyed every moment and waited until the explosion of course. That's what interested me the most. Again, I wasn't disappointed, but what mainly improved it was the audio. I was expecting a nice spectacle. I got that. I had pretty high expectations there, so it didn't wow me that much, but it appealed to me very positively with Ludwig Göransson's music, which always drew me into the story. At one point, he had me pretty well riveted with his music as well. I was a little worried about how it would turn out without Hans Zimmer, but it turned out that it wasn't only Tenet who had such a great soundtrack, at least in my opinion. I liked the music."
"What went well:
great performances from star studded castamazing visuals including special effects black and white camera filterscaptivating soundtrack from Ludwig Goransson.very informative in the sense that I walked out of the cinema knowing more about the life Oppenheimer, the story behind the atomic bomb and the Cold War than I did going in.Even better if:
it's a very long movie. BLIMEY! I feel like we definitely could have trimmed off an hour or so without affecting the quality of the movie.I felt like I lost track of the story a few times because it was told out of sequence and they kept shifting from colour to black and white (and they never really explain why)."
"I've got bad news for ya..."" Oppenheimer "" is not an epic or deep Christopher Nolan film about a controversial figure and an influential moment in human history...nope...it's like your average political drama with Robert Oppenheimer being the protagonist ! ( and Lewis Strauss being the villain lol )...and on the side we got a superficial documentary like style approach towards the whole nuclear weapons thing ...The only thing that adds glamor or makes it a little fancy is Nolan's style of directing and the star studded cast of course...most of them were committed and gave solid performances ...and then you have Gary Oldman who comes in for like two minutes and steals the show lol ...so ,there you have it ...Oppenheimer is super disappointing to say the least...it's a big fancy movie about nothing ...Even comes out as pretentious and trying too hard at times...there's even a scene that I just can't stop thinking about how awkward it must have been to shoot !( you guessed it ,it has Florence Pugh in it lol )...tbh it feels like this was very a personal project for Christopher Nolan...like he read the biography and thought why not make a huge hollywood blockbuster about it !...if you ask me the only reason to watch this movie is probably the fear of missing out that's all ...* sigh *"
"I had the privilege to watch it yesterday in an IMax theater and it was a wholesome experience. This movie ranks for me among Nolan's top 3 films and there is nothing anyone could do to change my mind. Nolan jumped in a completely new genre other than the adventure, action and sci fi genre and he outdid most of the biography films I have seen. I also hardly watch any political films and surprisingly the movie could grab my attention that much. From the very first scene till the last the cinematography and the great Ludwig Göransson's score will take your breath away and I think the oscar for best cinematography and score has already been decided. Ludwig's score in this film overtakes some of Hanz Zimmer's top scores that I admire. The VFX is no doubt so well made as well and you already know that he didn't use a single CGI shot. The movie resembles Cillian Murphy's top lifetime performance and I doubt anyone could have done Oppenheimer better than him and I doubt anyone could top his performance this year and it would be a complete robbery If he didn't get the oscar this year. More importantly, this movie represents a savior for RDJ's career. The first half his time on the screen wasn't much enough and I started to doubt that he would be great at all, however, the second half of the film was ompletely driven by him. He will take your breath away with one of his all-time best performance and I doubt that he would!t get at least an oscar nom for this. Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh's time on the screen wasn't much and I actually didn't like Florence's character at all. Emily did a couple of great scenes within the time allowed for her, but still I actually felt this character a bit weird and her relationship and actions with Oppenheimer wasn't clear enough for me. The editing of this film was also one of the heros got all these elements together and of course all of that wouldn't haven been possible without the great mr. Christopher Nolan. He easily can transform any element and any actor to the best form he could ever imagine of himself. All in all, it's a cinematic meal that you wouldn't wanna miss and the I-Max experience was one of a kind. A solid 9/10 and one of Nolan's all time top films."
"This movie is a treat to eyes. Visuals are spectacular. Cinematography is top notch.This movie teaches us a lot about Atom Bomb and how it was made.The story is beautifully crafted. Nolan did a perfect job in writing. Sound work in this movie is probably the greatest part. We can literally feel in the theatre what is happening in the movie. For first time the story can be a bit confusing. But with more watching the story gets more clear (Classic Nolan Things 🙂)
Cillian Murphy, RDJ,Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Matt Demon, Rami Malek & many others did the perfect job. From all of them I think the character of RDJ is the most unpredictable one (There is a surprise, not giving any spoiler though)Go, watch this movie and experience this beautiful piece of history."
"I walked into this movie with the expectation of it being anywhere from a top 5 Chris Nolan film to a Top 5 film of all time. Seeing it in IMAX, witnessing, feeling and experiencing the film in full force. I can honestly say it's closer to the ladder than the former for me. Am I saying it's 100% a top 5 film of all time? No necessarily but I think it's of the cloth of all those films like the Godfather, 2001, Shawshank ect. I think this is the best Nolan film, I think he truly made his magnum opus here and I can't wait to see if and or when he trys to top this. This is also probably the best true story I've ever seen adapted. Cillian was oscar worthy and should receive best actor for how his eyes carried so much weight in this film. Watch this film and my review on deep thought productions on YouTube. Thanks."
"Exceptionally crafted movie with all sorts of Christopher Nolan's touches. Brilliant casting and scores were the key thing to experience from this movie.A must watch movie in the theatre to experience the horrific heart beat while testing the nuclear bomb.Movie said in Cillian Murphy's view projection made the movie never boring to me, even though the movie was 3 hours long.It keeps people to the edge of the seats to discover and explore about Physics and the way create the bomb.Visually phenomenal and the blended sounding make viewers to keep going through the movie until the end.One of the Nolan's best crafted movie until today."
"Ok I wanted to quickly review Oppenheimer while its still fresh in my mind. So much to discuss. Firstly the cast, WOW! I love all the actors I found here, at least one of each of their movies is something I've really enjoyed in the past. Really like Josh Hartnett thrown in, Matthew Modine as well. Especially good cast for movie trivia in relation to past movies and collaborations. Each one contributes a significant role whether brief or not to the story of ""The Father Of the Atomic Bomb"" J. Robert Oppenheimer. But enough about that, let me dissect this movie a bit and offer some quick hits.While presented as a biography, behind the prowess of the lens of Nolan it shape shifts into courtroom drama (be prepared, its talky) but also takes on the form of something far more sinister I can only describe as similar to the movie Shutter Island. A psychological mind trip that may have a lingering effect on the viewer for a little while after seeing this. No joke. Its meant to send a message and it hammers it home pretty hard pulling no punches. Especially the last 90 minutes of this 3 hour train. Its paranoia at its finest and to the maximum. The reality anyone in a position of power (especially a brilliant mind) who has a few disagreements about how the government goes about their business would have to deal with. It made me constantly think of the saying ""Do you ever get the feeling you've been had?"" Not everyone you call a friend is a friend, and someone will always be jealous of your success out there. Its a really somber movie but man is it captivating.And let's be clear, it doesn't glorify nor condemn the nuclear bomb which itself is a big part of the cast. I feel it mostly attempts at best to simply educate. Whether it be the horrors and lasting effects of war, the use of nuclear weapons for power advantages between countries, or more positive things like what great scientific minds can accomplish as a collective, and the advancement of technology. Practically evolution. It really is a well done movie that you can think about for days.I think this is Christopher Nolan's most award season geared movie. Much less confusing than Dunkirk, its not comic book related, and its not as out there as Inception. Oppenheimer will be for Nolan what There Will Be Blood was for Paul Thomas Anderson. A magnum opus will very little CGI, which was a welcome sight. It relies heavily on a captivating main character, a cast to die for, a really well played out story and the always assured hand of Nolan. And did I mention Cillian Murphy a long time favorite of mine as Oppenheimer himself? A very well-rounded bravura performance, an actor that shot from already great to Gary Oldman territory (is he also in this? Lol) with this very movie in my opinion. Surrounded with such great support, Murphy stands out in every scene he's in. What a powerhouse! A fantastic quality was the strong convictions he portrayed that Oppenheimer himself was all about. Deserving for an Oscar nom in my opinion and I would be ecstatic if he were to win. And I won't forget to mention the interactions with one Albert Einstein, critical moments in the movie for sure.So there you have it. I recommend seeing it for sure. Its extremely relevant as related to our past as the world population and a scary possibility to our future."
"I understand that many people were disappointed by the film because they were waiting a movie about the ww2 or the making of the atomic bomb, from the name of the movie you knows that its not, it about the story of oppenheimer. A little boring and a little too long and some time make so confused by the many names and informations that were thrown in some scenes, but it's intentional by nolan, he wants you to stay focus and enjoy the dialogue which you should if you are a true cinema lover. A masterpiece in every single way from music to cinematography to story telling....
Not the best film in the history that's for sure but it is indeed the most important story in the history of mankind."
"The summer block buster! Oppenheimer probably and should win a few awards. Old days Oppenheimer would be just another good movie! A bit over hyped, but because Hollywood is so repetitive and woke. The public is tired of another super hero c g i movie, and/or wokism's disjointed stories characters and lectures etc. In contrast, Oppenheimer is just a true believable, and interesting story of a complexed flawed genius! Murphy best role, Redeye was good too, of a arrogant, self absorbed, selfish complex man who carried the weight of helping make a dooms day weapon. One experiences the academic silliness of who's smarter, the insensitivity/naïve of brilliant academic people. If anyone ever teaches or works in a lab one has seen this! Oppenheimer at the level of being so smart almost insane we get a glimpse of the apple part of the movie! Oppenheimer goes from black and white of how others see Oppenheimer and colors of how the protagonist see himself. The story blends Oppenheimer personal struggles with the the enormity of building of Los Alamos! Communist leaning intellectuals, infighting with the staff, mixes with the military and the project and ending a war sub stories. A good mix part war movie, part 80's soap opera. Matt Damon's character pushes forward the story of the general who knew how to push the smartest man in the room forward. Matt should get best supporting actors here. Well written, acted and crafted by the director Oppenheimer goes full circle of the frailties of jealous, arrogantly self absorbed political side of film which is identical to the academic characters which hits Oppenheimer when the scientist is no longer of use. A good crafted story, a heavy watch, but Oppenheimer did not feel like a 3 hour movie. 7 or 8 stars."
"""Oppenheimer,"" directed by the visionary Christopher Nolan, is a thought-provoking cinematic journey that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist who played a pivotal role in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. With a stellar cast and exceptional storytelling, Nolan's ambitious project offers audiences an insightful look into the mind of a genius torn between moral obligations and the relentless pursuit of scientific discovery.Set against the backdrop of the tumultuous era of the 1940s, the film presents Cillian Murphy's masterful portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Murphy effortlessly captures the complexity of the man, showcasing Oppenheimer's intelligence, charisma, and unwavering passion for science. The character's inner turmoil is vividly conveyed as he grapples with the implications of his work on the atomic bomb, questioning the potential catastrophic consequences of its deployment.From the very first frame, the film's cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema takes center stage, creating a visually stunning spectacle that enhances the storytelling. The grandeur of the scientific world and the intimate struggles faced by Oppenheimer are both captured with meticulous attention to detail. The sprawling landscapes of Los Alamos and the tense laboratory scenes further immerse the audience in both the scientific genius and the moral dilemmas that haunt the protagonist.True to Nolan's signature nonlinear storytelling style, ""Oppenheimer"" weaves together key events from Oppenheimer's life in a non-chronological order. This approach adds layers of depth to the narrative, illustrating how the past, present, and future intermingle in the mind of this enigmatic figure. The director skillfully juxtaposes Oppenheimer's personal relationships, political pressures, and the weight of history to highlight their profound impact on his decisions and actions.The supporting cast delivers strong performances that complement Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer. Marion Cotillard shines as Katherine ""Kitty"" Oppenheimer, the physicist's supportive yet complex wife, who provides valuable emotional insights into her husband's struggles. Michael Caine portrays Richard Tolman, Oppenheimer's trusted advisor, with gravitas and wisdom, while Kenneth Branagh brings an authoritative presence to General Leslie Groves, the military leader overseeing the Manhattan Project.While ""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic triumph in many respects, its dense narrative and extensive exploration of historical events may prove challenging for some viewers to follow. The film demands an engaged and attentive audience, and casual moviegoers might find themselves overwhelmed by its intricate plot and philosophical undertones.Nolan's portrayal of the Manhattan Project, while compelling, leaves some critics desiring a deeper exploration of the ethical implications surrounding Oppenheimer's work. While the film does not shy away from addressing the moral quandaries, some argue that it could have gone further in examining the profound and far-reaching consequences of the atomic bomb.Despite these minor critiques, ""Oppenheimer"" remains a visually captivating and intellectually stimulating cinematic experience. Nolan's direction guides the audience through a complex web of historical events and personal struggles, effectively capturing the essence of Oppenheimer's brilliance and humanity.At its core, ""Oppenheimer"" raises questions about the role of scientists and their ethical responsibilities in the face of groundbreaking discoveries. It serves as a timely reminder of the potential consequences when the pursuit of knowledge is not tempered by ethical considerations.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a compelling and intellectually engaging film that offers an intimate portrait of a man who played a crucial role in shaping history. Christopher Nolan's direction, Cillian Murphy's outstanding performance, and the stunning visuals make it a must-watch for history enthusiasts and fans of thought-provoking cinema. Despite its occasional narrative complexities, the film successfully navigates the delicate balance between exploring Oppenheimer's brilliance and the ethical dilemmas that continue to resonate in our world today."
"This movie is definitely a gem and a unique film that deserves to be seen but viewers need to know what they are getting themselves into before watching it. This isn't a war movie and there's barely any elements of action, suspense, or thriller in this. This is history and autobiography from a cinematic and dramatic point of view. You go in there just to focus on the dialogue and the acting performance going on because that's what it's all about in this movie. It's basically two stories of Oppenheimer -
1) His involvement in developing the A Bomb
2) The suspicion of him being a Communist.This isn't a war movie. It's strictly about Oppenheimer and what he was and what he went through. I personally thought it was overextended and hoped to see more about the war, the actual effects of the A Bomb and its aftermath impact but that wasn't the case here.Basically, this movie is more of an autobiography with a course of history revolving around a specific character. It's worth watching but it's not something to watch again (unless you are obsessed with the actual character) and it's not cinema worthy (unless you really want to experience that 1 minute explosion scene) because it's all about dialogue and characters."
"Another film where the director is "" Hey look at me how clever I am"" Starting the movie from the middle of the story , then going back to start and back to the middle, short scenes , continually cutting from one scene to another, as if you were watching the trailer. Cringeworthy sex scenes, I really don't want to see a naked man sitting in a chair talking to a naked woman. The film is set in the black and white era of the 30's and 40's so why did we need to alternate from black and white to color? A let down in so many areas and gets drawn out to a 3 hour yawn feast. Had I not gone with friends I would have walked out after 30 minutes. Only saving grace was some good acting performances which is the reason for the two stars. There are many excellent documentaries on Oppenheimer and would certainly recommend you watch one of them instead of this movie."
"Oppenheimer was one of my most anticipated movies of the year! Why? It's directed by my favorite director ever: Christopher Nolan. He has never made a bad movie, makes consistently good movies, and gives the audience original and unique films for their jaw to drop! I love this movie! It's very dialogue heavy, well paced, beautifully shot, amazing music score, Oscar worthy acting, and a fantastic script! This film will definitely get nominated for a bunch of Oscars and I hope it wins a lot of them! Cillian Murphy is absolutely stupendous! This is his best performance to date as I do see an Oscar nomination coming his way. Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr. Are also excellent as I also see nominations coming their way! This film would not have been as great if not for the performances because basically everyone gives a performance to not be forgotten! Nolan breaks down this film into three different acts which work so well. The story structure is very smooth although it can be hard to follow during the last act. I was invested from start to end and I was really surprised with how well the dialogue was written! It didn't disappoint as it's my current MOVIE OF THE YEAR!"
"I watch most Christopher Nolan movies as they are long and in depth as he is a director that tries to state his case. His latest ""Oppenheimer"" is a well done look at a complex and important historical figure in scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer the developer who created and discovered the atomic bomb. The film is informative and it takes the viewer thru different time periods, while blending the life of a man with the current world. The cast and acting is all star form with Murphy who's great as Oppenheimer the chemistry is supported just fine by Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., and Florence Pugh. Along the way the scenes are tense as one can see that Oppenheimer has some regret and remorse after he created the bomb. It really takes one back to the days of the Cold War, communism, Hitler, and when Russia and Japan weren't friends of America. Over all any historical buff will enjoy this film as it leaves an impact just like Oppenheimer left impact."
"Saw the movie "" OPPENHEIMER "" at PVR Phoenix( Parel) on the first day second show of its release in India on Friday(22/7/2023). As a student of history found the movie true to its era of "" World War II "" but was also surprized regarding the bold sex scenes in the film. Definitely a bit censured to Indian audiences. The film was extraordinary in special effects while depicting the testing of the first atomic bomb and subtle in not showing the dropping of the 2 atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Having visited Zurich was amazed to see the Grossmünster church towers depicted in the initial introduction of the film. Excellent movie but could be boring for non history buffs. A Oscar contender and if a film addict don't miss this film even if physics is not your pet subject of discussion."
"In simple words, Christopher Nolan is THE GOAT... Oppenheimer reaffirms it again. With each film in his filmography, he has established himself as one of the best directors in the industry. Each new work surpasses its predecessor. This film is the synthesis of what Nolan is himself, cinema.3 hours of film that go by in an instant. From the first minute the plot grabs you and doesn't let go until the black screen appears that signs the creator of the wonder that our eyes have just witnessed.Let's talk about another kind of magic in the movie. An acting chair for the entire cast. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr straight to the Oscar. Allow me the comparison, but it is as inevitable as the creation of Oppenheimer himself. The rest of the cast, exactly the same. Each one appears at their opportune moment and gives their best to complete the work.What else can we talk about? The musicalization in absolute harmony with each scene, the narrative as impeccable and captivating as only Nolan knows how to do it and each frame teleports you to the historical moment that it shows you.Oppenheimer is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen and it has given me a cinematic experience that I will never forget. For someone like me who loves movies so much, Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is the most comforting caress to the soul."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. There is no denying that the acting by everyone involved is truly top notch from start to finish. The score is amazing. The cinematography is incredible. It is much much easier to list the very few things that I disliked than the numerous things that were extremely well done.First, I will say that I felt the 3 hours flew by. It was well edited (not perfect) and there was a lot of dialogue packed into the final act of the movie, which helped with the pacing. However, I found that a few of the climaxes towards the end were diminished by the sometimes complex/confusing timeline that Nolan used. I am normally a huge fan of this aspect of Nolans works, howeveri felt that some of the moments towards the end that were supposed to really hit hard were muted by the fact that I was trying to keep up with who/where/when.Other than that, it was still very good and I very much enjoyed it."
"Oppenheimer is the greatest cinematic experience I have ever had the chance to immerse myself in. It is an exceptional movie that gave me goosebumps and put me in a solid state of paralysis for 3 hours. Cillian Murphy's acting in this film is (beyond) Oscar-worthy. The visualization of the detonation of the atomic bomb was executed with uttermost brilliance and truly made me feel as if I am about to see with my own eyes, how perhaps one of the most dangerous weapons in the history of humankind is released into the world. Christopher Nolan has created a masterpiece and used IMAX technology like no other director has ever before."
The lead actor Mr Murphy was nearly as gaunt as the real Robert Oppenheimer. A similarity to Shawshank Redemption where the lead was born for the part. In Shawshank Tim Robbins excells and goes on to appear in not much. C. Murphy is unique and perhaps limited in future centre stage roles. My pick for the movies stand out is Robert Downey Jnr. He entertained us with his broad spectrum of thespian skills. This time a real snake in the grass. The authentic RDj was just under the surface busting to free range. Jason Clarke the Australian actor put in a subpurb performance as the hawkish prosecutor. Director Christopher Nolan is to the directors fraternity what Daniel Day Lewis is to the thespian club. A massive hands on effort. Gripping. The movie is looo...ng with little crash bang action. It's take up in many Asian countries/ communities would be limited. The ultimate dialogue spectacle. A thinking platform deluxe.Patrick.
"Let's be real. Everyone knew it was gonna be a 10. From the breathtaking visuals to the spectacular practical effects and incredible sound design; this film quite literally gives the audience everything.It's crazy how even after knowing how things really went down the intensity is still crazy. Literally everyone was in this film. It's as if Nolan assembled the entirety of the actor's guild and let them have their share of screen time. With that said, Cillian Murphy is still the heart of the film. He has very clearly given his all to the role. His mannerisms and stature are contrasting to that of his other portrayals, really showcasing how talented he is. As one would (should) expect, RDJ killed every scene he was in. Big up Florence Pugh. She really cooked in her surprisingly small amount of screen time. Now i have to talk about the experience that this film provides. Honest to god, my seats were rattling during the ""explosive"" moments adding to the already thrilling sequences. The fact that even the normal scenes are shot in IMAX adds to the immersiveness. This film really is a masterpiece. My only complaint is the fact that this film is long and when i say long i mean you can feel the length. To conclude, never bet against Nolan."
"One of the most anticipated movies, because of the man behind it, happent to know the story before going into movie. Frankly, the movie feels stretched, wanted to just leave the theatre about 2 hrs in, but stayed in respect of those 2 hrs. Legal proceedings just such a bore, shouldn't have been given this much significance, just flooded the movie, also I wasn't confident about where his wife's motivation comes from. For the first time ever I noticed this style of movie making that is present in this movie actually bothers me. Whole movie divided into 5-10 seconds scenes, what is it Mr. Nolan, don't trust your viewers to have longer attention spans?"
"I am afraid i am posting contrary to popular opinion. This is not one of Nolan's outstanding works. There is no unifying track and felt like all over the place.Couldn't understand Matt's role, just felt like he was there just to say his lines that's all. Inconsequential. And about Robert, didnt understand the seemingly artificial tension that was tried to be created and all of a sudden Rami Malek was airdropped into the climax to turn things around a bit but that was just to counter Robert and that was it. Why was the socialist propaganda stretched in the movie I am not sure, but if it was only to drag this in the dispositions, then thats overkill. That secret dialog with Einstein that he revealed in the end was so underwhelming...While his pursuit of science, regret and affairs etc are all there, somehow don't demonstrate the storytelling one would expect from Nolan. I cant believe Nolan made it, I want to know who Nolan delegated this movie to.This movie wasted a lot of genuine talent and great performances just because the storyline was not edited properly. Can't unsee it though. So much for imax."
"Have been here for quite some time (over 50 years) and have watched my share of very good films, but this might very well take the cake.My previous ""top choices"" were Godfather 1 & 2 and Pulp Fiction, but today I saw Oppenheimer in the cinema and it blew me away. I need some time and maybe a re-viewing to get it all into perspective, but it is such a good film on multiple levels. The story is told in a way that you don't get lost, but you also don't see all the pieces until the director wants you to. The acting is phenomenal (not a surprise with a cast like this) and for me (as someone that grew up during the 70's and 80's) the topic of nuclear war fare and the cold war is something that is very, very relatable. And then there is the cinematography and the sound effects that both tremendously enhance the experience.All in all, it would surprise me if this is not already the biggest contender for double digit number of Academy Awards and in my opinion, deservedly so."
"Masterpiece from mr.nolan
the direction of the film is amazing it is a bit confusing at first going into 3 timelines at the same time but it the film is so much fun when you realise it shortest 3 hours of my life enjoyed it so much just a complete masterpiece.Black and white was a bit of a change definitely enjoyed it.Soundtrack was top notch dramatic when needed thrilling when needed it just supported the story and dialog.Yhe conversations were so entertaining even though alot is physics related but still a whole lot of fun.I strongly advise anyone to watch this masterpiece personally my fav movie of all time till now."
"In summary, Oppenheimer fulfils its promise of portraying the story of the father of the atomic bomb, but it focuses more on Oppenheimer's life rather than being solely about the atomic bomb.Cillian Murphy delivers an exceptional performance, portraying Dr. Oppenheimer as a politically charismatic character facing complex ethical challenges. Despite Robert Downey Jr.'s brief appearance, he impressively portrays an intricate and cunning antagonist. Tom Conti also shines as Einstein, offering a fresh perspective on the iconic scientist. The film boasts a fantastic cast, featuring a remarkable array of A-tier celebrities, each delivering meaningful and captivating performances.The visuals are vivid and striking, effectively contrasting the beauty of nature with the destruction caused by man-made annihilation. The cinematography and angles used draw the audience into the film, making them feel like active participants in the story. The soundtrack, typical of Nolan's signature style, effectively builds up emotions in the viewer. The incorporation of ticking, banging, and marching sounds exemplifies the arms race between Germany and the US, while the shrill highs and low bangs heighten the uncertainty surrounding Oppenheimer's state of mind. The delayed explosion of the trinity test symbolizes the naivety of the Manhattan Project's inception and the devastating consequences that followed.However, the film falls short in addressing the consequences of the atomic bomb's detonation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, with many implications left unexplored. Nolan's focus on the US legal system and the political power play against Oppenheimer somewhat overshadows his emotional conflict and ethical complexity. The film seems more like a factual biopic, at times neglecting to delve deeper into Oppenheimer's inner turmoil.Despite its exceptional acting, great cast, stunning visuals, and compelling soundtrack, Oppenheimer's approach can be demanding and occasionally implicit, making it feel more like a documentary than a cinematic epic. While some viewers may appreciate this factual portrayal, others may find it lacking in emotional depth, requiring endurance towards its conclusion."
"The only thing keeping this movie from a perfect 10 for me is just personal taste. I'll always prefer a Nolan original story than an adapted true story. With that being said, Nolan made this movie as engaging and thrilling as any biographical movie could possibly be. Every element of this film is just top notch filmmaking. I can't really imagine any other movie releasing this year coming close to it, and I expect it to near sweep come award season.Even if you have no interest in this story and find a movie about J. Robert Oppenheimer to be boring, you'll still leave this movie feeling you just witnessed a creator at the top of his game. Not to mention, the gut punch the movie makes with its commentary on the past, present, and future of what nuclear technology is to the world we live in."
"J. Robert Oppenheimer was an american theoretical-physicist that was the main boss of The Manhattan Project. He worked on the atomic bomb that could stop the wars between 1939 to 1949. This movie was about Oppenheimers story and life, and how the atomic bomb changed the world forever. Oppenheimer was the worlds savior, but also the killer of a thousand people, innocent and not. It was a very well movie, and showed Oppenheimers moral thinking and how he made the bomb.I was really satisfied about this movie. 3 hours was not bad, for what they were going to show, and I wasn't bored any minute. The sound effects in this movie made the atmosphere very good, and the music was perfectly made for what the scene was showing. Great written and directed by Christopher Nolan, that have directed The Dark Knight and Interstellar. The casting was good also, with Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon and Rami Malek.The moral is very clever and it is also like a warning. That a bomb like that should not be made, and what the consequences can be for making something like that. And Oppenheimers look at the end of the movie, a look of eternity in destruction and madness. That look is something you are going to remember.I did not see it in IMAX, like it was filmed in, I have heared that it is very good in it, but if you watch it in normal 2D I guess it is also good and I recommend to watch this movie anyway. Amazing movie, amazing story, acting, and it was very good directed. Should win an Oscar. Definitely."
"In the realm of cinematic brilliance, few films can boast a roster as astounding as Oppenheimer. Directed by the visionary Nolan, this movie is an absolute treat for cinephiles, but not for casual viewer. But what sets this film apart from the rest is the awe-inspiring performances by a multitude of S-class actors, who deliver their roles with such astonishing realism that it's hard to believe they are merely ""acting.""The storyline revolves around a gripping tale of love, loss, betrayal and redemption, set against the backdrop of World War II. However, it's the actors' performances that truly elevate this film into a realm of its own. Each S-class actor seamlessly becomes their character, breathing life into them with such profound authenticity that the audience is transported into their world.Leading the pack is the incomparable Cillian Murphy, who portrays a brilliant theoretical physicist who was pivotal in developing the first nuclear weapons and then finds himself torn between two conflicting paths. His journey leads him to a pivotal moment that demands an excruciating moral decision, one that can alter the course of not only his life but also the lives of those he cares about. His portrayal is nothing short of breathtaking; every subtle emotion is conveyed through a single glance or a quiver in his voice. It's as if he is genuinely experiencing the turmoil of his character, leaving the audience completely engrossed in his journey."
"In a year that saw the release of movies like John Wick and Mission Impossible, Oppenheimer stands out as a shining gem. Throughout its 3 hour duration, I found myself literally on the edge of my seat, immersed in a well-crafted storyline and a stellar cast.Without revealing too much, the highly anticipated nuke scene was executed with perfection, leaving pretty much everyone satisfied...The performances of cillian murphy, RDJ, and matt damon were nothing short of Oscar-worthy. Notably, Nolan provided RDJ with an opportunity to showcase his acting prowess, breaking away from the role he had portrayed for a decade, and he delivered magnificently.The film boasts beautiful cinematography, and Ludwig's masterpiece original score keeps you engrossed throughout the entire movie.My suggestion is to refrain from reading reviews and simply go watch the movie, as it is definitely worth it. If possible, opt for the best screen available, such as a 15/70 IMAX or some other form of IMAX, to fully immerse yourself in the experience."
"Single handedly beats Titanic, Avatar or any other piece 3 hours long. Few of the scenes are difficult to pen down on a paper, or even imagine leave alone making them into a reality. Should go in the Top 5 Movies of filmmaking history.Not even a second is boring, repetitive or shaky. Personally I don't think anybody on this planet could have come up with such filmmaking if it wasn't Mr. Nolan.Beautiful ensemble, imagination, storytelling and score. Can You Hear the Music, one of pieces in score is phonetically sound, and increases its tempo every 6 seconds. The homesick chapter couldn't be more immersive experience."
"'Oppenheimer' could have been great. And here's how. Shave off 30 to 40 minutes. That's it. That's all it would have taken. I don't want to find myself impatient while viewing a film as important as this. Nor do I want to check my watch. More than once. But I did. And did it again. And maybe even a third time.Point is, the message in Oppenheimer is repeated again and again. And it's: Not everyone who worked on the Atom Bomb was a blond-haired blue-eyed All-American Boy. The scientists and engineers had backgrounds that differed from the American stereotype. Their values and beliefs were different from 'ours'. Some were Communists. Others were former Communists. Still others were Anti-Communists. Some were great family men, others were womanizers and brought pain to their spouse. But about two things they agreed. (1) World War II had to be brought to an end. And (2) Nazi Germany could not be allowed to beat the Allies to the technology to build and use The Bomb.Again and again, through character after character, that message is brought home. In government hearing after hearing that message is brought home. I wanted to stand up and yell, 'OK OK I got it.' No more. Let's move on. But moving on took quite a bit of time. And it's there, in those Post War government hearings and interrogations that the film seemed to slow. By this time we knew who the film's heroes were, we knew the villain to be unmasked. And knowing what I knew I was anxious for the obvious to be stated. But the film's final hour refused to give us what we wanted until - it seemed - the production ran out of film.Other observations:a. Cillian Murphy is great as a hard-to-define Oppenheimer. He's odd, but odd in a way that's hard to pin down; we like him and respect him but there's something going on in that mind of his that I found disquieting.B. Florence Pugh is sensational as Oppenheimer's lover; as sensual a performance as has ever appeared on the screen.C. Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife is equally good but in a vastly different way. She ages, and ages badly, right before our eyes. She suffers and we suffer right along with her.D. Robert Downey Jr. As a hopeful member of the President's cabinet is fabulous. He was one with his character. Best Supporting Actor qualities.E. There are many - too many? - foreign scientists. Truth be told I could not always tell one from the other. Not a good thing. As one of them is a spy for The Soviet Union and when the spy is uncovered, I had no real idea of who it was. Or how important was his role.F. Christopher Nolan's films play with time. Think Dunkirk. Think Tenet. Think Interstellar. They all took hard work on the part of the viewer to know where and when we were. Likewise Oppenheimer. We've got flashbacks by the dozen. Flashbacks within flashbacks. Maybe a flash-forward as well. Too much playing around with time for me. Just tell the story, Nolan. Stop being cute.Anyway, See Oppenheimer. It's heart and mind are in the right place. It's an important film. Well made. Good to look at.But long. Too long. By far."
"The poster is better than the film. The excitement and anticipation of this film had me gripped for weeks with its stellar cast, a decent subject centered up Robert J Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. What can possibly go wrong, I asked myself ?Quite a lot, it seems. The film just doesn't gain any momentum throughout the entire thee hours duration. It's very hard going for the viewer, in my case I fell asleep twice and I have never fallen asleep during a film at the cinema before in the 59 years I've been on this earth.Trust me, don't believe the hype is a clichéd statement but in this case it's very much the truth.Three hours of your life you will never get back.You have been warned."
"No film is perfect but Oppenheimer is close to perfection. The dry source material is elevated with brilliant cinematography, art direction, editing, excellent cast, direction and superlative sound design.There are lots of breathtaking moments. The pace is incredible. Entire set pieces only briefly glimpsed. It feels like a Hollywood film from yesteryear. It never outstays it's welcome and there is so much going on, it throws so much at you that even though some of it doesn't stick, the stuff that does will keep you thinking for days after.Chris Nolan is, hands down, the most important and innovative director working today. This is his most personal film yet and should definitely be seen on a large screen with loud speakers. Outstanding."
"Never seen so many people sitting so quietly in a movie threater. 3 hours of pure connection with the film is guaranteed. The music is fab. The dialogues are amazing with the facts, science, politics at a particular timeline is thoroughly covered. It has everything one can ask from a movie. The actors are amazing, seeing so many familiar faces, Hugie from The Bois series, the boy from the film Heridertary. The kid from the Assassination of Jesse James the scientist Papa from stranger things, Matt Damon, Iron man himself and Mr Robot Rami Malik and Emily Blunt. So many familiar faces such great team. The actors gave their all. Going to watch it again in IMax after refreshing the famous political terms."
"Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, the story centers around physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) who was appointed as the director of the Manhattan Project by Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr (Matt Damon) during a pivotal time in World War II. They gather a team of scientists spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. The aftermath of his creation not just changed the world but also turned his personal life upside down.Walked out of the theatre, I imagined how it feels like to be able to watch movies that are always considered the best of all time or even defined the cinema at its recurring time. Because that's how I felt after watching Oppenheimer, I'm just glad I got to experience the movie to the fullest. From Tenet to this, I don't think that's a comeback anyone can top in years to come. Oppenheimer is Nolan's most significant work thus far, I might need another viewing to make sure this's his magnum opus though it's certainly close. He brings his infamous nonlinear storytelling structure once again and captivates the audience to this epic, dialogue-driven three-hour biopic that delves into the moral dilemmas of a man who's haunted by a burden from something he invented whilst everyone around him keeps glorifying the man for what he has done to the country.Cillian Murphy reunited with Nolan for the sixth time but in this one, he finally takes the leading role, he absolutely deserved it. Without a doubt, Murphy delivers a career-best performance, he might be getting that Oscar nomination after all these years or perhaps he'll bring it home which I think wouldn't be a surprise for anyone familiar with his work. And i think people aren't giving enough credit to Benny Safdie who also shines opposite Murphy, the two always clashed throughout the time while developing the bomb in Los Alamos due to their difference. The ensemble cast is probably the most impressive of this year, everyone gave a solid performance and builds a great chemistry even the ones with less screen time.With a hefty 180-minute runtime, writer-director Christopher Nolan wastes no time since most of it consists of time jump and some people might lose track of the time or events that take place but he didn't let that slide by shooting key sequences in black and white giving more clarity to the narrative as the movie progresses. Nolan teamed up again with his frequent collaborators, cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema and composer Ludwig Göransson. Together, they present a technical marvel that'll make an unforgettable moviegoing experience, from awe-inspiring cinematography to a heart-pounding musical score.I highly suggest you to see it at the biggest screen you can get, there's a reason why he shot it with IMAX film cameras, he doesn't want you to just watch but also make sure you get immersed into this very moving story."
"The intensity with which this film and the actors deliver is nearly off the chart in every scene. From the back-and-forth in time, to the studied nakedness of some characters, to the outright hostility sometimes shown: this is great film-making and great acting. The pace changes, but does not languish. The nuance of self-doubt is played epically by Cillian Murphy, and the suffering Mrs. Oppenheimer is played brilliantly by Emily Blunt. Nearly all the cast are engaging, with hidden sides or fears, faults, and even valor.The juxtaposition of the celebration at the detonation of the bomb, and the Japanese surrender, against the agony of Oppenheimer's descent into an emotional hell is well done, excruciating to watch as a man who set Duty ahead of personal preferences is so evident. And the final scene is so poignant as to make you see how, indeed, ""patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.""Oppenheimer worried about the consequences of the bomb. Rightly so: anyone who develops or uses weapons must always grapple with the reality that war is inhuman. I would have been disappointed had the movie sought to glorify the project. We did a disservice to Oppenheimer's legacy. This movie has done much to reveal the human side of his experience. Well done."
"My first 10! During World War II, Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. Appoints physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer and a team of scientists spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. Their work comes to fruition on July 16, 1945, as they witness the world's first nuclear explosion, forever changing the course of history.Just a little heads up before I start, I would like to make sure you know that I found it difficult to write this review. Anything stated as a review of its magnificence would be an understatement. Words truly can't describe the brilliance of this movie.Christopher Nolan has established himself as one of, if not the best director in Hollywood nowadays. He was able to transform a biography into a brilliant mind-bending movie that leaves the audience thinking about every frame for a very long while. The movie just leaves you in a statet of disbelief; no one could directly leave the theatre right after the movie ended. The timeline and the story in general were so messed up and confusing but it came together like puzzle at the end. The cast was so good. Everysingle cast member had one of the best performances of their life. The dialogue was so good. The visuals were stunning (0 CGI was used according to Christopher Nolan). It was all just so good. I can go on and on but I can stop by just saying that this is my first 10/10 review.Score:10/10."
"It is a Nolan movie. It is a biopic. It is about the life of the most important man in the world at that time. His complexities, his flaws, his challenges and how he was treated. Those aspects cannot be changed by Nolan. It is based on a book. But Nolan takes the source material adds his flavor of intertwined timeline, epic visuals, brilliant dialogues (the best in any Nolan movie), mind-blowing sound and a fantastic screenplay.Add to this the performance of a lifetime by Cillian. His eyes under the IMAX lens sucks us into the shoes of Oppenheimer. We feel the man. Intensely. Some of the scenes bring tears to the audience's eyes, but Cillian just stares into the camera and pierces our heart. He looks and feels like Oppenheimer. Even in the interviews promoting the movie, he still looks tired from the performance.Robert Downey Jr shatters and breaks through his Iron man cage. You wont be reminded of his Marvel role at all. And that says a lot about the performance. His anger and ego comes out strongly as any other dramatic performance of the decade.All the other cast also have given their best. Emily Blunt shines in the few scenes that give her the opportunity. Matt Damon is also striking and a relief for the audience. Rami Malek, many of the Nolan constants (NO, Micheal Caine is not there ehre) have all done complete justice. The performances take the movie a notch ahead.The music is also brilliant and draws in the emotions from the visuals and fills our ears. Brilliant score, haunting where it has to be and epic elsewhere.Cinematography is a new leaf for IMAX where the focus is not on huge sets pieces or scenery but on the performances of the cast.Finally Nolan pulls of one of his most daring ventures. He challenges the audience to focus on every word and every visual, which is not easy for the people used to the short attention on their phones everyday. But it pays off. You get the experience of being in the World war era and in the shoes of the man who had to design to kill to save lives. And the fear and horror of Nuclear bombs is as relevant as it was then.Watch with an open mind and 100% focus. You will be transported elsewhere. And it will take a while to return to your usual self. And that is how great movies leave the audience."
"As one that loves Nolan's work, i never watched one of his films on cinema.I've never been to a film on IMAX before so i took the chance and decided to go.And that probably the first time that i enjoyed a movie a lot.The sound was amazing and the fact that there was 0 CGI was even more amazing.Murphy's acting was truly good and i enjoyed it a lot.The IMAX experience was so amazing I was stuck to the chair for the whole 3 hours and i truly recommend everyone to go to the IMAX version.The writing was very good and ill recommend it for people who doesn't necessarily love science.10/10."
"Finally a movie worth watching in theaters! I was so hyped that we went to watch this movie and the crowd it draw. Perhaps reviving cinema! Overall it was a wonderful movie. It started out with the character being an underdog physicist then a notable one and turned in to politician and revolutionary personality. Cillian played like a boss, the music was on spot, the shooting legendary. Christopher Nolan never disappoints in the quality he brings to the table. The cast he chose was great as well, RDJ was the hidden villain. He also showed how greed can influence your decisions and affect others. Thank you very much for the experience, so grateful 🙏 I did not know anything about Dr. Oppenheimer previously and knew very little about the process."
"The movie kept me on my toes the whole time. Although its long I had never the feeling that the movie drags on but rather than it took its time in the crucial moments and lets you hold the breath with the main characters true some intense occasions. While I understand some critics saying that it should evolve more around Oppenheimer itself and that the movie is trying to be more ""clever"" than it is with its time jumps, I felt that this was one of the movies great advantages.It's like watching three different movies in one. But in the end it is masterful composed to one spectacular experience. You see kind of a biopic of Oppenheimer himself through his younger years which is told in retrospective through his interrogation which channels in a politic thriller. And you see the happening of the trinity test through the perspectives of different characters that were involved.Unlike other Nolan films you never need to wonder at which point in time the story is cause its quite clear through the movie - thankfully so.Cillian Murphy is spectacular in carrying the emotions which Oppenheimer must have went through and is aided by an insanely talented cast.While the film might not be for everyone it is absolutely worth watching if you'r ready to let it be what it is and just want to take part in a moment of history that changed the world.10 / 10."
"As a huge fan of Nolan's work, and deep fascination with the Manhattan project I was looking forward to this.Pros:
The movie is at times quite riveting, with a haunting soundtrack. Cillian Murphy does an INCREDIBLE portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer. All the actors showcase their ranges varyingly from decent to truly great. Emily Blunt truly shines in this, as does Robert Downey Jr, Kenneth Branagh.Cons:
It was too densely packed with intra-professional and intra-personal politics, as well as Oppenheimer's personal life. Sometimes the retrospective scenes don't work very well. Except, I think they do help bringing context to why the future witch-hunt ties to events in the past. I just thought the execution of the retrospective scenes left something to be desired.There was not enough emphasis showcasing the healthy ""competition"" between the two teams: Implosion (Fat Man, Plutonium) and Gun Type (Little Boy, Uranium). Historically, there was a sense of competition in the sense of exploring different methods to achieve the same goal, but both teams worked on their designs in relative isolation and with mutual respect for the scientific challenges they were facing. There was a sense of uncertainty regarding the behavior of plutonium, because it was a much more recently discovered isotope than Uranium. Due to the simplicity Little Boy (Gun Type) was considered the ""safest"" bet, due to its simple design, and was considered the ""back-up"" in case the implosion gadget ""Fat Man"" failed.There wasn't enough emphasis given to showcasing the other tertiary (but important or famous) historical characters. For example, Richard Feynman barely has a few lines spoken. The only memorable scenes with Feynman was when he played bongo drums, twice. I would have loved to see Jack Quaid get to showcase his acting as Feynman. He already was well cast with a striking similarity. I would also have loved to see Leo Szilard and Einstein's letter read by Roosevelt. There was not enough time dedicated to the Klaus Fuchs espionage and treason, and subsequent detection by counter-intelligence. An interrogation of Fuchs' motivations would also have added to the strength of the main point that I believe Nolan was trying to get across with the movie.I was not convinced of Matt Damon's portrayal of the (historically much more corpulent) Leslie Groves. His talents are great, but his acting as Groves felt uninspired and forced compared to what I've seen him in previously. And, I do think prosthetics would have been in order as well.Insufficient cinematic drama and focus given to the technical difficulties and physics-challenges.I wish the movie would have shown the following technicalities, in a riveting dramatic form I know Nolan is more than capable of:1. The breakthrough of the Chicago Pile fission in 1942, following the German success.2. Uranium separation and enrichment. The operation of cyclotrons, and subsequent development of calutrons - with the famous ""Calutron Girls"" who operated them at Oak Ridge TN. Following that, the subsequent expansions into further methods of meeting the challenge of enriching uranium more efficiently. Such as diffusion. Then, there should also be the clandestine logistics surrounding this. The importance and talents of Leslie Groves as an engineer would have been highlighted here, as he came up with the idea of using the outputs of some plants as the inputs in other plants. Wouldn't even need to be very detailed, just a brief showcase of 3-5 minutes.3. Socio-organizationally: Not enough emphasis and detail given to how the secrecy was maintained fairly successfully for such a huge undertaking with at its peak 129,000 workers and scientists tied to the project in some form. Compartmentalization was mentioned as a word several times, but it was not showcased very well in practice. Nor how this compartmentalization was experienced by the thousands of people involved across the country, and the family members at Los Alamos. The level of surveillance would also have been great to see.4. The breeding of Plutonium from Uranium, and the challenges of this.5. The development of getting the explosion lenses just right and perfectly balanced for the plutonium implosion gadget. In the movie all we saw was what seemed like just testing if the lenses exploded at all, but not how they were testing and measuring for their precision and balance.Final words:
Understanding that it's a biopic about Oppenheimer as a person, I can understand the emphasis on his love affairs, and the subsequent politics and witch-hunt. But I think it went overboard with it. I had truly hoped this was going to be more of a movie about the Manhattan project, or at least 50/50. There could at least have been given equal time to the aspects I have raised here. Instead, it felt like it was 70-90% about Oppenheimer's personal life, and the witch-hunt politics. I sort of enjoyed it, but would not watch it again."
"Oppenheimer is 80% of interrogation between opphenhimer and Lewis Strauss assembled people to check opphenhimer loyalty to America. It's 10% of Trinity test and 10% some glims of Manhattan project. So it's a crap out of it. Don't watch it in theater , wait and watch in ott. Oppenheimer is much hyped crap. Even though the subject in public domain Nolan not delevared a good script. It's another fail movie from him.It's 3 hour move. Only half an hour can watch. I m fully West desspointed after watching it. It's waste of 100 million dollars cost. He did crap this time. Nolan will remember this failure."
"Christopher Nolan has once again proven his mastery of the cinematic art with ""Oppenheimer,"" a mesmerizing and thought-provoking exploration of one of history's most pivotal figures. This epic biographical drama takes us on a thrilling journey through the life and times of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant scientist responsible for the development of the atomic bomb during World War II.Nolan's direction is nothing short of breathtaking, seamlessly blending historical accuracy with his trademark visual and narrative prowess.

Christopher Nolan's direction, coupled with exceptional performances, a compelling screenplay, and awe-inspiring visuals, makes this film an unforgettable experience. A must-watch for history enthusiasts, cinephiles, and anyone who appreciates thought-provoking storytelling at its finest."
"One of the very, very few movies I give 10 to. This movie shows a new form of storytelling, one that is highly sensory and emotive. Nolan has broken the boundaries of conventional movies to create an experience beyond the pages of a script or the timeline of a plot. He shows he is in absolute control over what the audience catches and misses in every line of dialogue, in every shot, and uses that as his instrument to craft his symphony. The tension building throughout is paced in a well-balanced ocean of waves, rising and releasing, to carry the viewer to stranger shores. It felt as though the movie was written for the music rather than the opposite, which says a lot about the symbiotic effectiveness."
"Oppenheimer has left a profound impact on me. The film's storytelling and character study were brilliantly executed, drawing me into the life and mind of J Robert Oppenheimer. Cillian Murphy's performance was nothing short of exceptional, bringing depth and authenticity to the character.Visually, the film was a treat to behold. The cinematography, especially if you see it in IMAX, it adds that immersive quality that really enhanced the overall experience. The attention to detail in recreating historical settings was also commendable, making the film feel remarkably authentic.Oppenheimer managed to strike a balance between explosive action and cerebral depth, showcasing Christopher Nolan's prowess as a filmmaker. It's a captivating blend of thought-provoking themes and enthralling storytelling, which left me contemplating the implications long after the credits rolled.While the film had many strengths, I think that it could have been even more impactful if some of the female characters like Jean Tatlock had a bit more character development. This aspect felt somewhat lacking and deserved more attention in my opinion.Overall though, Oppenheimer is a magnificent piece of cinema that stands out as one of Christopher Nolan's best works. It's a film that engages the mind and emotions, and which will leave a lasting impression."

"""Oppenheimer"" is a three hour, dialog- driven narrative that's nearly the life story of the man chiefly responsible for inventing the atomic bomb. The movie gives Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey, Jr. The roles of their careers, as they become dueling scientists over the years. Emily Blunt brings a stark intensity to the role of Oppenheimer's wife. There's a twenty minute sequence just before and after the test explosion in the desert that displays the anticipated visual thrills, but viewers looking for mind-blowing effects throughout will be disappointed. Audiences looking for a rather sophisticated depiction of a troubled period in global history, however, might enjoy this. Gary Oldman is on screen for no more than 90 seconds near the end, but he gives a devastating portrayal of President Truman, who meets with Oppenheimer briefly, weeks after the end of the war. The movie not once falls into the trap of trivializing the subject by being a roller coaster ride of special effects, and for that reason alone, Nolan should be congratulated."

"They won't fear it until they understand it. And they won't understand until they've rewatched it. First watch will take you only so far.A lot to take in and absorb. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr have given their best ever performance. Nolan delivers again with his team in Cinematography, Techniques and sound editing. It would definitely take a second viewing to completely appreciate and or understand every aspects.The experience on first viewing is mostly positive and captivating. But Nolan being Nolan with his non linear storytelling and layered character study; this requires to be seen again at it's own pace to be fully grasped. 8.5/10 on first watch."
"This film is brillian; this is the first time a biographical film has my made my heart race this much!This film is not for everyone. It challenges the viewer, really: can you stay focused for three hours, even without action? If yes, you came to the right place--if not, this movie is not for you.Oppenheimer is an eye opener for me. Prior to this film, I would have never felt bad for people who are exceptionally gifted in the sciences. But now, I do. This film tells the story of physicists who were doing amazing things, but at the wrong time. The perfect time for governments to exploit their scientists for evil.It puts you in the shoes of physicists. You're told that if you don't contribute to the war, many will lose their lives. But once you do... you now have to live with the concience that you unleashed a weapon that the world will fear for the rest of history."
"The story of Oppenheimer itself is all over the media recently, so the whole plot was all known to me with all its intricate details.The photography, costumes are flawless, acting is very good, but not great in many characters.Following the plot is annoying. It is easy to be done, but jumpin back and forth on the timeline, learning many-many new characters every other 5 minutes just takes away from the experience of watching a movie.Personally I miss any technical details and science. Also much-much visual joy could have come from depicting experiences and the big boom.In summary, it way predictable, annoying, dissapointing, but professionally done."
"The cinema was full, properly full for the first time in at least 3 years, everyone eagerly anticipating this major Hollywood take on the world shaping events of the Manhattan Project.Within a half hour my wife was asleep, I was still hopeful that the film would step up a gear and start to build, only it never really does, it ambles along for well over an hour before we really hear anything about the project itself. Even then it remains pretty dull.Do not pay to see this film ! Its a sad fact that, along with the bomb test itself, the other major highlights involve Florence Pugh, playing girlfriend Jean Tatlock, and her most impressive breasts.The focus of the film is really the, largely irrelevant, aspects of Oppenheimers life before and after, his friendship with some left wing and communist party members."
"Nolan delivers a compelling biopic which keeps you hooked from the start to finish. Though 3 hours long, it keeps you glued to the screen. This is a movie to be watched n the big screen, nolan weaves a agical experience. The cienematography and story telly is is top nautch. This is one of the finest movie made by nolan.You get to know te internal details of the lide of Oppenheimmer and his achievements and dillemna. You will also know the background of what went into making of the A bomb and the bobing of Hiroshima & Nagasaki. The politics behind the action and thirst for Power.Ciliam Nurphy - Absolutely briliant in each frame, he brings the character to life. Conveying a lot through his expessive eyes which Nolan makes full use of. His scenes with Albert Eienstein will give you goose bumps.Robert Downey jr - Though a supporting role, he lends lots of sincerety to his role and does a good job.Matt Damon lends good support as Major general in charge of the Project.Emily Blunt as oppenheimmer's wife is a very strong role and she is very convincing. The hearing scenes where she is questioned on her link to communist groups is classic."
"I was entertained and amused. But the judgement from the judges who made this film was questionable to say the least! I was promised Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice doing a track but that never happened I was promised a Heated Oppenheimer remix but that never happened. I was promised a Albert Einstein did the thing, Kitty Oppenheimer my woman king, Oppenheimer JR you are a genius and Tatlock Jean you are all of us! But no not even Ariana Debose or Ariana Grande what is this behaviour stop licking donuts and men that have no right belonging to you! I was promised Gigi Hadid in the film in Manhattan with Ganja but Miss Hadweed failed! Not even Cher bothered showing up to play a seductive Harry Truman desperate for a role as Seymour in Little shop of horrors! Somebody lied to me several times about what was in this film I took my grandma and she agreed that she would rather watch Barbie and she once threw a whole KFC bargain bucket at Ryan Gosling and told him he had a Crimson Chin in Crazy Stupid Love! Even Matt Hancock a history nerd is at home lockdowned in the bed with his missus! Cheers folks Alexis Michelle is crying again cause she had to watch this! Team Barbie folks I tell it as it is if you want a film that is all cat and no mouse then Barbie is the one."
"Jaw dropping intensity and allure. A sequence filled with enigma. Sequences carefully curated in the highest quality. Filled with scenes and cinematic with the most delicate care, intrusive details, emotional intensity delivered in the most impactful way. Knowing little about the figure that is J. Robert Oppenheimer, or knowing far too much, this doesn't miss a dot. From perfect edge-of-seat timing, to precision of words and delivery by a profound set, this is an absolute homage to the complexity that makes this physicist and relative figures. Hero or villain, martyr or heathen, is beside every point, as this film goes to challenge every point of view and leaves a pondering, critical, thought provoking moment that in of itself leaves a most bittersweet feeeling."
"Big fan and highly recommend the TV series ""Manhattan"". Didn't think I had much left to learn. However, ""Oppenheimer"" brilliantly illustrates how rapidly the world of physics changed in the 30's and the urgency with which the, largely Jewish, group of scientists leapt into action to kick some Nazi ass. The pen is mightier...with the caveat, Gen. Groves also kind of a badass to make it all happen. Not a ten because I'm thick and had trouble following the story line involving Strauss/Oppy conflict. (the isotope story? I needed more info) Even though the Editor will get Oscar nom., Even though using B&W is a cue, I felt like I was playing catch up in all the Downey scenes. No fault of R. D.'s, he was pitch perfect. As was Murphy, Blunt and Damon. Assassins all. In a good way, this movie is very dense. I'm not a fan of having to watch something more than once to completely absorb the story. The naturalistic, quick, sometimes muffled dialogue, took a minute to get used to. But once I let go and assumed I was in good hands it got better. The three hours flies by. I saw the 70mm print, yes it's worth the extra bread. I wept for mankind after the ""successful"" test. So, mission accomplished there Christopher. Again, great flick, not a ten because I have to see it again."
"In a time of great uncertainty, the importance of this movie is unmatched. In attempt to highlight the gravity of this part in human history, it felt at times underplayed and in some minor instances lost in the duration of the film. However, overall the message was brought across very well albeit the duration and tidbits of humor. (i was somewhat disappointed when audience members in the cinema laughed at any point, as it exemplified some of the ignorance with regards to the subject matter and the implications of concepts and matters portrayed in this in film, or rather what this meant/means for humanity).The cast and their respective acting were top notch. Great casting, As was the accuracy of the science, and political climate at the time.Oppenheimer is more of a political thriller that floats alongside the morality and ethics in the pursuit of scientific progress. Most importantly though, this movie manages to accurately highlight the United States disregard for human life in the pursuit of military and economic hegemony, as well as the magnitude of what the science of the atomic bomb meant/means for the world.I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie in order to reflect what the US has done, how it operates and what it means to drop a nuclear weapon, on/by anyone. Let alone proceed to design an even larger one. Understanding that science is a gift in the right hands, but corrupted in the wrong ones.Thank you for everyone who participated in the making of this movie, and I sincerely hope it contributes to a more thorough understanding of the choices made by society."
"SCORE: 9.2/10This has been quite the disappointing weekend for me. Barbenheimer was supposed to a historic day in cinema history and go down as the day that the 2 best films of 2023 came out on the same day. Instead, we got 2 films that underperformed in comparison to the hype they received. You wouldn't be able to tell though, as the overhype is continuing to manifest itself in the scores people are giving both movies. As I said in my Barbie review, that is in no way saying that these movies sucked, because they were both good. It is also important to preface that Christopher Nolan is the greatest Director of all time, in my opinion, and he simply does not miss, Oppenheimer included. What I will say is that Oppenheimer is no where near his best film and has a lot more flaws than people are willing to see.This will go down as one of the most Film Bro movies of all time. Anything less than a perfect score will receive judgement that you aren't smart enough to understand what true cinema is, and that you probably just didn't like it as much because there weren't any cameos in it like those ""awful Marvel movies"". This movie was way too long. I found myself checking my watch around the 2 hour mark, wondering if it was close to being done. It was entirely too bureaucratic for my liking, and the jumping between timelines worked well, until it didn't. I was enjoying the hell out of this movie for about half of it and then it just became way too complicated with way too many people involved and I found it difficult to focus. You could tell Christopher Nolan was really getting deep into the storytelling, which led to some moments where you were just watching him cook and wondering where he was going with it all.With all that said, the positives far outweigh the negatives. Every single acting performance in this film is fantastic and brilliant, but this is Cillian Murphy's Oscar to win, and he damn well deserves it. He gave every ounce of himself to this role and it shined through in his historically great portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer. RDJ did a great job as well, but I'm not going to let him get away with saying this was the best movie he's ever been in. Over Endgame? Infinity War? And the original Iron Man? The Barbenheimer Actors certainly have a lot to do with the hype surrounding these films and the expectations they set up for themselves. The underlying story of the Atomic Bomb was spectacularly played out and peaked my interest the entire time it was explored. It felt like a history lesson that I wanted to go on forever so I could learn more, until it became all about the politics of it again.I truly thought Oppenheimer was going to be one of Nolan's greatest films. He was telling the story of the person he claimed to be the most important man in history and the historical context certainly set this film up to succeed. I don't know where the disconnect happened, and maybe it was the 3 hour runtime, but it went from a film that was so incredibly well put together to something that felt like it was dragging. I will probably not be rewatching this anytime soon, but I still think it was well done. Just like Barbie, I just don't think it met the expectations it set for itself. The audio and visuals were absolutely stunning as expected, and I'm happy for those people who loved this movie and think it's the best movie of the year. That's just not how I felt."
"Should I mark this review as containing spoilers? It's a historical drama and given that the movie is based on a novel that in itself is as close to historical fact as one can get, the move is basically pre-spoilt for anyone with a cursory knowledge of the events around the Manhattan project and the witch-hunt that pursued Oppenheimer and some of his close associates.All in all, this is a movie which one goes to see for the acting and the drama rather than the story itself. And boy, is the acting top notch! Downey JR and Cillian Murphy steal the show (as one would expect) but even the lesser known names have a lot to work with and they don't disappoint which is a testament both to their skill as well as the writers'.Faults?Well, being close to source can lead to a feeling of being rushed and it does feel as such. The movie rushes through Oppenheimer's life hinting at genius and brushing over faults, jumping at predetermined points in a way that feels quite artificial and forced. Indeed, Oppenheimer could have easily been an HBO TV series as there's a lot to take in.Science fan service includes name dropping of big names: Bohr, Bethe, Szilard, Fermi, Teller, Einstein, Feynman, Lawrence, Rabi and others. But Rabi and Teller aside, their relationship with Oppenheimer isn't explored nearly enough. I do love the attention in the portrayal of Oppenheimer's personality and also personal life and its consequences in the high stakes game around the Manhattan Project but it's a miss the fact that the movie simply brushes over why Oppenheimer even went ahead leading the project - all the more reason I would look forward to a series.Above all, however, looms the cheap drama that Nolan makes of Strauss' ""hidden"" witchhunt against Oppenheimer. It's cheap because there was no ""detective work"" needed to realize who pulled the strings. When Eisenhower offered Strauss the chairmanship of the AEC, his condition was that Oppenheimer was kept out of it. The animosity had already spilled over well before the month-long hearing used by the movie as the backdrop of the story.Consequently, Strauss losing the confirmation hearing was also no mystery whereas several scientists brought up the subject of Oppenheimer's brutal hearing.The movie's ""oomph"" could have easily been the internal drama of the morality of developing WMDs, their use and their later proliferation but it's understandable that Nolan, a true right-wing filmmaker that has no qualms about justifying the most questionable practices under the guise of security, would prefer to skip the debate.In fact, I was surprised to see the very question of whether WMDs should be used or not posed - it was hard to skip altogether but in the end we can still feel Nolan's efforts to brush it aside. After all, Oppenheimer not signing the manifesto initially makes it easy to paint him as being on the fence when in fact he went on to wage an all-out-war against nuclear weapons and proliferation - a battle replaced by the Strauss/Oppenheimer conflict.The ending of the movie is also just a bit too on the nose - but it's a fitting one."
"WoooowChristopher Nolan is back with a new masterpieceThe movies first of all haves great cinematography, great Sound and amazing actors
Like everyone does a amazing job.The way that leads you to the bomb scene was amazing. The movies haves a little twist in the end.The soundtracks was amazing to like this movies haves one of the best soundtracks.Cillian murphy deserves a Oscar for this.I hope the movie wins a Oscar.Only one thing it you don't like history or real cinema movies then don't watch it there are some people that only gonna watch it for the hype. But go watch if you are really wanna see a cinematic masterpiece."
"Oppenheimer is a decent film about an important subject that gets bogged down with minor politics, we also have the nolan cut... But a nolan cut with a poor pay off.Much of the film is full of close ups and facial expression but little else in the way of cinematography that we have come to enjoy in other Nolan films.The sound was good however and is purposefully jarring. The whimsical early soundtrack is slowly obliterated by orchestral, human or explosive rumblings. Everything utilised to nail down the power of the bomb.When the story follows the bomb and the challenges Oppenheimer had running the project it makes interesting viewing. The film constantly cuts between court like sequences set 8 or 9 years later. The problem with these cuts is that the pay off was of minor importance to the overall story.The acting was good, Murphy and Depp did a great job its a shame their rivalry was pushed under the carpet while also being at the forefront of the finale. Its difficult to try and create drama over such a small footnote in the titular characters life and then infer it rather than show it.The costumes and sets and the overall appearance of the film was very good and pulled me in a lot its just a shame the story wasn't as strong nor gripping as it could have been as well as failing to even mention many aspects of the real life project.7/10."
"So, I saw this this one after seeing many previews for it & had a feeling it would be good with an interesting story to tell, that & of course it was either this or Barbie (shudders), of course I went for this & thought it was average but only just that.During World War II, Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. Appoints physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer to work on the Top-Secret Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer & a team of scientists spend years developing & designing the Atomic Bomb.I found the film to be average, it's actually not bad & I'd have to say, the first Christopher Nolan Film I liked, if not the only. Though not nearly amazing, it's good & at least whipped the floor with that Barbie Film. But that's another rant for another time in regards to that flick, but anyhow, this film was enjoyable, but a chore to sit through. It's overly long & drawn being the main 2 issues I had when watching. The dialogue & the characters were the other 2 things, the former being too confusing & hard to get, though I did just about get what they were saying with the story & the latter, well, was in itself like the story of the film, a bit hard to follow & understand.The action in the film is good, but too few & far between. The runtime is a whopping 2 hours & 55 minutes, too long, way too long & that doesn't help with the dialogue & multiple characters being thrown in, not to mention the poor pacing issues this film had. But in comparison to Tenet & Inception, this was good & at least was mildly coherent, even though I did still find this flick hard to get, but it's Christopher Nolan innit? Rolls eyes...The eye candy & effects were good not to mention the visuals which were pretty impressive. Cillian Murphy done a great job at portraying Robert Oppenhiemer, so there's that at least.Overall, it's an overbloated film with poor pacing & a 175 minute runtime that could've used a load of work to it to make it snappier & more to the point, why it had to be stretched beyond breaking point is beyond me. The effects were good as with the eye candy, effects & the acting from Cillian & the others, but aside from that, it was average & at least better than Tenet, Inception & most importantly, Barbie...5/10."
"Now listen. I don't care who the director is, what films he made before or what he ate for breakfast. I'm not in the habit of being a fan of anyone. So, I'm not writing this because I think the director is a genius.This movie is quite amazing. I think the whole non chorological story telling is seriously overdone, but in this case it was a work of art that really served in highlighting various ideas and making some very interesting parallels.The movie is indeed long, and I saw some critiques that were speculating how there's no one to tell the director that it should have been cut, or that the last part of the movie was unnecessary. Well, in my opinion, there was not a single second that should have been cut. The last part of the movie brought home a big part of the movie's ideas and message. I suspect that some people just couldn't keep up with all that was going on. This movie would definitely require watching several times in order to get it more fully. I was stuck to my seat, enthralled, for the entire 3 hours. In short, 10/10."
"Oppenheimer is an unconventional movie for this time of year. It's not action heavy flick and it's mostly reliant on dialogue and conversation between the characters. My favourite part of Oppenheimer is that the story, characters and events were riveting despite the fact I knew comparatively little about the Manhattan Project going into the theatre. I was enraptured by these backroom political machinations and long conversations in classrooms, everything felt pertinent to the story and despite the contemplative pace, I couldn't turn away. If you're worried that some elements of Oppenheimer may go over your head, it shouldn't deter you from going to see it. I certainly didn't catch everything but when taken into context with the gravity of the stakes, the movie was no less entertaining or involving for it.We've become accustomed to CGI being part of the experience, it seems you can't have a big Hollywood spectacle without it. I wanted to comment on how beautiful Oppenheimer as a movie is through both its cinematography and its use of sound. The movie frequently cuts to chemical reactions, shots of the stars and towers of fire that underscore the gravity of what's being attempted. It also shows you something a little more tangible when they're positing theories about dying stars, atomic reactions and fallout. The visual sensibility makes things more dynamic and keeps the pacing up when it could easily slack. The use of sound in certain scenes amp up the tension. When Oppenheimer's guilt is clawing at him, he remembers the pounding of the feet on the bleachers when he was giving his speech at Los Alamos after the bombs had dropped. It made me jump several times as did the sound of the aftershock at the Trinity test. I think we all get that these men and women were developing something that would change the course of history but even in Oppenheimer's quiet moments, these effects serve as an eerie reminder of the eventual devastation that they brought onto the world.The ensemble that's been put together for Oppenheimer is unlike anything I've ever seen. This many recognizable actors in one movie isn't done unless you're buying a ticket for something like the new Avengers movie. As much as it may seem a little hackneyed, everyone is awesome across the board. There's not enough space to break down each one individually, Cillian Murphy is mesmerizing as J. Robert Oppenheimer. Murphy's physique and visage has always has carried a haunting quality and that lends itself well to the character. He plays Oppenheimer as a man who's grappling at several forces beyond his control and whose brilliance may never get the proper understanding. Instead of breaking down the whole supporting cast, I just wanted to highlight a few of my favourite performances. Robert Downey Jr. Transforms into Lewis Strauss. Oppenheimer is a nice reminder that while we all love RDJ as Tony Stark, he was once known as a prodigious rising star and he's completely up to the task as the vengeful politician. I was so pleased to see Josh Hartnett in a supporting role (the man who turned down Batman), I would have never pictured him as a scientist but he's great as Oppenheimer's supportive colleague Ernest Lawrence. Alden Ehrenreich is in top form with RDJ playing his Senator Aide. In another metamorphosis-style acting job, I really liked David Krumholtz as Isidor Rabi. Everyone in Oppenheimer is excellent but fairly restrained. Krumholtz is less muted, he exudes a lot of charm and warmth as the cautious but supportive Isidor. The only performance I didn't love was Gary Oldman as President Harry Truman. Oldman was great as Winston Churchill but he was a little cartoonish for me as Truman when he was harshly rebuking Oppenheimer for feeling guilty for his actions.Oppenheimer is so packed to the gills with memorable moments and vivid scenes that it's hard to find almost anything to criticize. I can't recommend that the length of the movie be extended but there were a couple of subplots I wish had gotten more fleshed out. I would have liked a little more time on Robert's relationship with his wife Kitty, Robert's love life is pretty unique (this is underscored by Emily Blunt's and Florence Pugh's terrific work as Kitty and Jean respectively) and it could have been given a little more time. I also would have liked some more coverage of the fallout in Japan after the bombs were dropped, it didn't hurt the movie's grade but it maybe would have added a little more gravity to the PTSD Robert was feeling post WW2.I was blown away by the experience that was Oppenheimer. Your expectations are going to be high going in, the project has all the pedigree you could want (the sparkling cast, Nolan's collective might as a director and writer, plus an important historical subject that carries overtones even today) but even with those high expectations, Oppenheimer surpassed them. There are nits to pick, every movie has them. But my eyes were glued to the screen throughout and considering the 3 hour runtime that Oppenheimer boasts, that's an accomplishment by itself. I'd rate it somewhere between a 9-10, I'd encourage almost anyone to check it out in theatres if you get the chance."
"Oppenheimer was a brilliant, intellectual, charming but controversial and complex man and Christopher Nolan did an amazing job capturing all different sides of him. This is probably one of the best movies I've ever seen. The movie did a great job of helping the audience feel, in a small way, how being a genius can be an amazing thing or debilitating. Women wanted to sleep with him and men wanted to be him, or probably, would or did sleep with him as well. He was very similar to a cult leader and could get almost anyone to like him, heck, I fell in love with him. I like how we still don't know if creating the atomic bom the right thing. Yes, Russia or Germany could have made a bigger one and detonated it over another country, including the US, but couldn't we have showed how much damage the bom could have done by dropping it in the middle of the ocean? Who knows, it's impossible to know, which is why the movie was so intense. I would have given it a 10 but there were some parts that were a little cheesy, like all of the celebrity cameos. In the end, this movie was well done and Mr. Nolan certainly delivered."
"Best line of the movie by Gary Oldman in a cameo that lasted less than two minutes. While Oppenheimer advertises on his creation, where it delivers is its exposure and reveal of the upper echelon of war and how something as concrete as us versus them can turn into you versus the world. Having that impending doom loom over his shoulders yet having to stand and listen to escalation at every level of more and more is where this film will make your hair fall out, and not from radiation but that which is much worse, stress. I love this movie and believe Nolan made a traditional documentary story into a riveting revelation about how the world is forever changed. We could all stand to watch this movie with held breath."
"Masterpiece. Movie is aboslute masterpiece. Cillian perfomances are stunning. In some parts of movie my heart was beating like it was Oppenheimer myself. That is because Cillian is masterclass actor. Movie is like a fine book or some badass fine wine, 3 hours of this movie fly by like it was 3 seconds. I think that if people is giving less than 10, they are just shittie idots, don't appreciate this movie or they don't have enough knowledge, experience or taste to see when movie is masterpiece. I think the messege is clear with this movie. How rutless world can be, when you are needed country will lick your balls, but once you are not gonna listen orders or having your own opinon. They will eat you alive. So also is with a friends or coworkers because of their own ego and jelousy they will do everthing to see your failure.😄"
"Christopher Nolan has returned and how!! Oppenheimer is another one of his beautiful creations. A movie which really is more than a movie. The intensity between the scenes, the slow yet powerful background... The creative mind behind the use of colours, and the impact it created. The movie is not just about a bomb or how is it build.. It's about the process one goes through while trying to make a change for his country. Cillian Murphy as Robert Oppenheimer has delivered one of the best performances of his career. But the x-factor comes out as RDJ. The emotions which were needed were perfectly delivered by him. In short, Oppenheimer is not everyone's cup of tea but those who love the reality stricken movie will definitely love it."
"FILM: 9/10.Oppenheimer has finally arrived, and once again I find myself captivated by Christopher Nolan's powerful storytelling. The film delves into the world of atomic bomb development and legal drama, unfolding through mostly conversational scenes that keep you engaged without relying on intense action sequences. Nolan leverages his influence in Hollywood to create a truly unique cinematic experience, utterly unlike any other July tentpole cinema event.Nolan's meticulous direction shines through as he presents a detailed study of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a complex man navigating through varied challenges during a turbulent period in American history. The non-linear storytelling, a signature Nolan technique, adds an enthralling layer to the narrative. What's intriguing is the Oliver Stone-esque touch of shadowy government conspiracies, weaving an air of intrigue throughout the film.Nolan's clever use of color and black and white scenes, reminiscent of his early film Memento, adds depth to the storytelling. The black and white sequences depict Strauss and his machinations, while Oppenheimer's perspective unfolds in vivid colors, offering distinct insights into the characters' lives.The performances in Oppenheimer are nothing short of outstanding. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of the titular character is simply brilliant, and Robert Downey Jr. Delivers an equally compelling performance. I wouldn't be surprised if both actors walk away with well-deserved Oscars next year. The remainder of the cast, spearheaded by an extremely effective Emily Blunt, all acquit themselves with ease and class.As the film reaches the momentous bomb test at the two-hour mark, Nolan manages to subvert expectations while still conveying the awe-inspiring power of the test. It's a testament to his storytelling prowess that he can keep viewers engaged without resorting to predictable outcomes.However, the final hour of Oppenheimer does suffer slightly from indulgence in the legal drama. While it showcases some of the finest performances from the cast, the prolonged focus on legal proceedings may seem excessive to some viewers, and it somewhat lessens the impact of the film's earlier captivating moments.Overall, Oppenheimer is an enthralling cinematic journey, masterfully crafted by Christopher Nolan. With its detailed character study, superb performances, and innovative storytelling techniques, it offers a unique perspective on a pivotal moment in history. Despite the minor quibble with the final hour, the film is undoubtedly deserving of the praise it's receiving, leaving me thoroughly impressed and reflecting on its themes long after the credits roll.FORMAT: CinemaVIDEO: 10/10.Native 4K presentation, Detail level: Excellent, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Excellent, Encode: Excellent, Master condition: ExcellentAUDIO: 10/10.Dolby Atmos audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Excellent, Surround sound presentation: Excellent, LFE content: ExcellentMOOFIEMETER: 9/10."
"I love movies that take themselves seriously, actually made with the intent of bringing something new or something unique to the world of cinema. This movie is most likely going to be my movie of the year due to Nolan's skill as a top tier director. The way that the film balances the black and white (objective scenes) and coloured (subjective scenes) is masterful and so well done. Even with no prior knowledge about Oppenheimer you will be surprised at how much you can relate to his feelings by the end of the film.Acting - 10/10

"The film's excessive runtime of three hours seemed to be filled with an overabundance of information, contributing to a plot that unraveled in a confusing and illogical manner. Detailed portrayals of the protagonist's conflicted wife, neurotic girlfriend, and unexpected child were overexposed and unnecessarily intricate. Furthermore, the use of nudity and sex scenes felt gratuitous rather than essential, detracting from the integrity of the female characters.It was particularly perplexing to see Oppenheimer carefreely cavorting with his troubled girlfriend in Los Alamos, only a stone's throw away from the tower set to trigger the world's first atomic explosion.The use of alternating black and white with color imagery was an unsettling choice. Rather than adding depth, it disrupted the film's continuity and created a sense of disarray. The film suffered from a lack of seamless transitions, hopping abruptly from congressional hearings to scientific forums, from festive parties to intense discussions with scientists, all while intertwining themes of construction, detonation, politics, and communism. It felt akin to attempting to assemble a coherent picture from a mix of unrelated crossword puzzles.The special effects seemed poorly planned and came across as amateurish. Recurrent visuals of billowing flames interspersed with bubble-like entities, a motif that began during depictions of Oppenheimer's youth, were repetitive and detrimental to the flow of the film. And it's as if the sound studio team was impacted by the same radiation emanating from the plutonium.The film's aesthetics also left something to be desired. Overdone makeup and hair styling, paired with frequent manipulation of film contrast levels, gave an unnecessary air of surrealism.Moreover, the supposed interactions between Oppenheimer and Einstein lacked credibility, and complex physics concepts, such as quantum mechanics and relativity, were reduced to cryptic symbols on blackboards, with no effort made to incite curiosity or comprehension.Despite these criticisms, I acknowledge the attempt, even if it fell short. In this instance, the transformation of a written piece into a cinematic narrative unfortunately failed.However, not all was lost. A commendable performance from Robert Downey Jr. Shone through the chaos. His portrayal was nothing short of brilliant, perhaps even the pinnacle of his career."
"This was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen.I truly do not understand the hype - I have loved ALL of Nolan's previous works but he's stepped far away from his comfort zone in this feature. It's a style of movie that I would enjoy if I was heading in knowing it was written by Aaron Sorkin - a movie of this pace requires such a talent in order to survive. However, as Nolan is not Sorkin, the script and pace are equally interminable to the point where I had to walk out after 2 hours just to save time in my life.Honestly by the time I left, I didn't even know what was happening in the story or, quite frankly, why Nolan thought it would be interesting enough to tell - I can now understand why this story hasn't been told before."
"This is the best of the best. Nothing else to say.Bravo, Nolan, Bravo.The pace, writing and direction of this movie is at such a professional level that I finally believe in cinema again.Credits to Ludwig once again for the insane and diverse score. He can make a launch so tense with just his maestro talent.The cast is insane. I don't refer to just having x or y in the cast. But how they perform their character. I was shocked by Emily Blunt's and Robert's Performances, insanely good. Cillian, I sincerly hope you get all the praise you deserve. I felt your emotion coming to life through the screen.A movie not to forget. Superb biopic."
"Oppenheimer is a new film adaptation of a historical biography directed, co-written and produced by Christopher Nolan, director of The Dark Knight trilogy, Inception and Dunkirk.American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is asked to help develop a new weapon around the time of World War II.During the war there is an arms race, in which different countries try to develop the atomic bomb first, to get to the top and win the war.With this film, Christopher Nolan tells the history and origins of one of the most dangerous weapons ever: the atomic bomb. In this way he shows why and how Oppenheimer, together with other scientists, eventually came up with the idea for this weapon. He also clearly shows the pressure that the government and the army have put on the scientists to be the first to finish the bomb.The story can seem a bit complicated during scenes in which the scientists are busy with their theories and elaborations to be able to experience the bomb. Despite these nature and chemistry aspects, as a viewer you can continue to understand what they are doing. It is not that after watching, for example, you know for yourself how an atomic bomb is put together or how it can be made.Surprisingly enough, Christopher Nolan did not use any special effects such as CGI or a green screen for this film. He only uses makeup effects to make the film cast look older over the years. Nolan has filmed real explosions to depict what an atomic explosion looks like, but then used fewer, violent explosions than a real atomic bomb. In this way he shows that films can still be made without special effects, which are often used in modern films today.Cillian Murphy does a great job as Oppenheimer. He shows well with his eyes and further facial expression how the character feels or what goes through him during the film. He deserves to be nominated for film awards for this acting. Furthermore, Robert Downey Jr. Also good acting as Lewis Strauss, who tries to steer Oppenheimer a bit, but secretly also influences a bit during his developments of the atomic bomb. He would also deserve to be nominated for best supporting actor. Emily Blunt also plays the role as Oppenheimer's wife well. Matt Damon plays Leslie Groves who observes Oppenheimer from the military angle. Furthermore, the film consists of a star cast such as Kenneth Branagh, Florence Pugh and Gary Oldman. Although some play more of a cameo role, the entire cast does a good job. In this way, each character helps to move the story forward, but Cillian Murphy really remains the main character that the film continues to focus on while he is designing the nuclear bomb."
"Wow! Just spent beautiful 3 hours in a theatre and what a movie experience!All hail Cillian Murphy.I'm a true Cillian Murphy fan and this he took it to another level.Engaging narrative. Excellent castSo white and black scenes are Strauss's narrative and colour stream is Oppenheimer's.History shown beautifully.I especially liked the actor who played Teller's role.A sneak peak into the whole atomic physics and the intensity of the happenings.Just enjoyed understanding, analysing, discussing, debating the whole movie.I'll definitely watch again once on OTT and I'm sure to get more perspective."
"I've seen this film twice. Once just simply isn't enough to truly appreciate everything. There is a LOT to unpack here. But let me first start by saying this movie isn't for everyone. In a world where people are used to over-the-top action movies, Oppenheimer is certainly way out of left field. It's very scientific, very historic, and frankly too high-brow for a large portion of the American public. But if you're the type that enjoys truly good cinema, you're in for a treat.Cilian Murphy delivers a career performance as the titular character. His demeanor, his mannerisms, his eyes (man, his eyes!), Murphy nails it. From a humble grad student to a middle aged man defending his actions against a ruthless counsel, Murphy executes the role with perfect poise. If he doesn't win Best Actor, then the Oscars are a sham.The cinematography was fantastic. Van Hoytema is at the top of his game in this film. Practical effects are used exclusively and to great effect. In a movie that's predominantly dialogue driven, it's important to nail the moments where effects take over, and he certainly did just that. The bomb scene was spectacularly executed. As was the subatomic symphony going on in Oppenheimer's head throughout the film.The set pieces and inclusion of historical figures was outstanding. We got to see all of the world's premiere scientific institutions and the world renowned scientists that studied there. It really felt as though you were watching the culmination of centuries of physics...because you were.The dialogue was exceptional. Murphy and Downey Jr. In particular delivered their lines with such mastery. Even the supporting cast of Damon and Blunt stole the show when given the opportunity.There were so many fantastic historic moments, excellent one-liners, and jaw dropping scenes, it's hard to even recall them all.This is Nolan at his best and a true masterpiece."
"Directed by: Christopher Nolan
Written by: Christopher Nolan
Production: Syncopy Inc, Atlas Entertainment
Distributed by: UniversalSUMMARYOppenheimer, a physicist, is approached by the US government to create the atom bomb. Oppenheimer gathers a team and creates the bomb at four different sites across the US, including a manufactured town at Los Alamos. Oppenheimer is portrayed as a troubled man, with both ego and morality. In the second half of the film, his wrestles with trying to hang onto his fame as the ""Father of the Atom Bomb"" while his image is torn down as a communist.RATINGB+Oppenheimer is a thrilling film about the creation of the atom bomb. The cinematic filmmaking is beautiful here, with thrilling sound design and chilling sequences where Oppenheimer wrestles with the guilt of creating a weapon of mass destruction. I would have liked the story to be more complex, not about reputation, but rather about the human cost of the bomb."
"I was not disappointed when I left the theatre and there wasn't a moment in the three hours I was there that I wasn't enthralled with the story. Some say that biopics lack suspense, but I found myself holding my breath. That's what good filmmaking is, and boy does Christopher Nolan know what he's doing when writing a story for the screen. This of course was based on true events, but the format in which Nolan shows us the story is reminiscent of Memento with the dual perspective black and white vs color, that I think works really well here. The women in the film were not reduced like they often are in historical biopics, but they were characters with their own arcs and developments. The practical effects were visually captivating, and film choices like camera angles, lighting, and soundtrack all helped add meaning behind the visual while at the same time immersing the viewer in the time period.Cillian Murphy was very believable in the role, as were Oppenheimer's feelings as they were portrayed not just by Murphy, but by the rest of Nolan's artistic choices. Robert Downey Jr. Made a very convincing Strauss, showing off his range as an actor as he departed from the fast-talking acting style he perfected during his contract with Marvel.While sound mixing has oft been a problem for Nolan movies played on differing formats like with Tenet, that was not an issue here. The bombs were realistically louder than the average volume of the movie, but the dialogue was all audible.All in all, I think this is a movie was if anything, underhyped and is one I'll definitely watch again. I hope Nolan chooses to do more movies like this."
The movie is a 10 anything lower than 9 is not accepted whoever gives it lower than 9. Either doesnt know anything about history or dislikes it or didnt understand a thing.My point-Its breathtaking this movie shouldnt be compared to anything that comes out this year.Give Cillian his oscar already and also Rami malek was awesome even he had so very little screen time he was amazing and Rober downey junior spectacular proved he was a very good actor and not just some actor whos famous for one roleThe movie was very deep.And oh my god the detail behind the black and white and colourful scenes is a must know before watching the movie.Thank you Christopher.
"I haven't been in the cinema much in last several years, but I wasn't sorry of 3 hours spent on it, and I'm glad I didn't wait for it to come to streams. I want to praise Murphy, but it wouldn't be fair to others, because all of them have done amazing work with this one. Answered so many questions I was always wondering about Manhattan project, about organization, and state of mind of these people. And how did they feel when they've seen results of it. It also shows how American politics can easily turn a hero into a villain, and how little common sense means in that surrounding.Plus, with resurrection of cold war, we need something to remind us what kind of treat is hanging over our heads. Something that we have almost forgot."
"When you go to watch a movie, you usually go with some expectations from makers' past work.If you want to see a typical nolan movie, you will get disappointed.But just go and watch it from a neutral point of view, you will love it
First of all this is an adaptation of book, American Prometheus.Obviously when you do such adaptation, you can't change much event to make it more dramatic.Fiction gives you liberty to add as much spice as you need.But when you judge a movie based on a book adaptation, you must have basic knowledge about the book.Read it or atleast get some briefing.This is probably one of the best movies based on a book.Dialogues were written so amazingly, you can see shadow of nolan in dialogues.This movie is 70% politics and 30% science but it's not makers' fault. That's how the book is narrated.Judging movie based on screen play, dialogues and acting, there is not a single fault.RDJ and Murphy both steal the show with oscar level performances.And i am glad nolan didn't try to put his opinions, rather he just showed reality and let us judge.."
"The acting was really good and I liked the cinematography, special effects and the settingThe conversations in this movie are unbelievably shallow, cutting is over-used to avoid anyone having any meaningful discussion. The greatest scientific minds of the 20th century and we barely get to see them interact.After the movie it was kind of unclear to me - what was Oppenheimer's brilliant contribution? Was he able to solve scientific problems that others could not? Was he an amazing leader who inspired the people to work towards the goal? Would have been more interesting to see scenes of scientific debate, failure, insights etc.The choice of the other plot (with RDJ, who was great!) was so confusing. The choice to intercut the plots took away a lot from the sense of urgency, the race against the Nazis to build the bomb.I just don't think Nolan has the writing skills to give the subject the deep treatment it deserves and I was really disappointed."
"This is another film made for the people that made it to show off , not for the viewer to enjoy it's has a lot of unneeded dialogue , a lot of stupid dream sequences , cillian Murphy is not engaging enough ,This is s film everyone tells you they love because other people have told them they love it , all hype no executionLike the Irishman , and banshees of innisheran it will be forgotten once watched , I would bet my house no one will be re watching this is a few years despite the unbelievable amount of waffle surrounding itAnd why do I have to type minimum amount of characters , waste of time , reviews on here should be allowed to be more succinct instead of these wanna be semi pro film critics."
"""Oppenheimer"" is an extraordinary piece of cinema that showcases the brilliance of Christopher Nolan's direction and the exceptional performance of Cillian Murphy. Nolan's intelligent filmmaking demands the audience's full attention, weaving narratives and time periods seamlessly to tell the captivating story of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Murphy's portrayal is nothing short of mesmerizing, earning him an Oscar-worthy performance as he navigates the complexities of this historical figure.Nolan's non-sequential storytelling style adds depth and intrigue to the narrative, immersing us in Oppenheimer's life, successes, and personal struggles. The film's runtime of three hours flies by, thanks to Nolan's expert pacing and the engrossing plot. The director's commitment to practical effects heightens the tension during pivotal moments, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.Supporting actors, including Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, deliver powerful performances, adding layers to the film's exploration of Oppenheimer's relationships and choices. Each character represents significant aspects of his life, making us question the price of scientific advancements during wartime.Nolan deftly explores the moral conflicts that shaped Oppenheimer's legacy, humanizing him beyond the label of ""the father of the atomic bomb."" The film delves into the consequences of his decisions and the burden he carried throughout his life. It successfully portrays Oppenheimer as a multi-faceted figure, neither a hero nor a villain but a flawed human whose actions changed the world forever.""Oppenheimer"" is not your typical biopic; it challenges the audience to ponder the ethical complexities surrounding the development and use of nuclear weapons. Nolan's direction and Murphy's performance make this historical figure relatable and thought-provoking. The film's brilliance lies in its ability to entertain while sparking meaningful discussions about the consequences of scientific discoveries and the impact of personal choices on a global scale.Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" is a captivating and intellectually stimulating cinematic experience. Nolan's artistic vision, coupled with Cillian Murphy's remarkable acting, elevates this film to the pinnacle of biographical storytelling. It serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of responsible decision-making and the enduring effects of our actions on the world. A must-watch for film enthusiasts and history buffs alike, ""Oppenheimer"" exemplifies the finest form of filmmaking that both educates and entertains its audience."
"Oppenheimer is indisputably one of the best films of the century. The production is an intense character study of one of the world's most complicated scientists whose mark on the world was lesser known to the general public, until now. Christopher Nolan creates a spectacular and unsettling story that is complete with suspense and ethical difficulties. Cillian Murphy is amazing in one of the most enthralling performances of his career. The story has numerous characters and each cast member brings a spectacular addition to the story. RDJ plays a disturbing role, Florence Pugh plays a tragic part, and even Tom Conti plays a charming Albert Einstein. The final scene is so impactful it will leave a lasting imprint on your psyche."
"It feels like the end of the world, without the end of the world. This is not only an huge and twisted story that had and still has global consequences, it's an look inside the mind of the man who gave mankind the power to destroy themselves.Oppenheimer is a genius, and within every scene we are confronted with that. Robert isn't the kind of man which is interested in science, he is the science. He does not think in normal therms, he see's the world in atoms. Especially the first half gives incredibly insight into this. There's a montage which describes his mind and being beautifully.Nolan's hugest strength is his reliability on real facts and real life. His films never are just pure entertainment, and for me that's what makes him stand out, because he gives me a better understanding of a topic I'm merely interested in. I always tend to inform myself about the science behind the ideas of his films, and I love that. Especially in Oppenheimer, when it comes to the scene where the discover nuclear fission, I LOVED it, and I wanted to hear MORE of it.The Los Alamos part is where things get disturbing. That whole build-up to the detonation was heart-pounding, Ludwig Göransson's score builds that tension so high, I was scared for that bang and shockwave. It felt scary and unreal, and when it happened, I had goosebumps all over my body, that look of Oppenheimer without his glasses into the fireball, repeating the Bhagavadgita line, you could feel his infinite regret.That's what makes the film outstanding. The moral conflict of Oppenheimer, you can see it in his eyes for the whole film. Cillian Murphy Is Oppenheimer.It is an extraordinary film of an extreme important topic that every human being which is interested in communism, science, most importantly physics, politics or history should've seen.The world since then never was and will be the same. And my mind simply can't comprehend the thought that there was a slight possibility that they could've caused a chain reaction which would've end the whole world, and they still pushed that button. That thought does not leave my mind.The examination that comes full circle towards the end is outstanding. It's an hyper-realistic representation from the world of politics. Nolan could've dived even deeper into the nature of every character that sits there. Which role they've had, which strategy the followed. Some stand beside Oppenheimer, some against him. Some just needed to protect themselves or were forced or convinced to be against him. Everyone with their own background and own reasoning. Just like in real life. And you can't escape that when you're important. Even when you just want to be a physician. There's only one person who could escape that, Albert Einstein.In the end, Oppenheimer is a film that demonstrates that this event shaped our lives for infinity. We are the most dangerous species that exists, because we gave ourselves the power to destroy ourselves. No mouse ever would've built a mousetrap. It's a testament, that the people leading nations will always strive for more power and might. Scientists always thought about the bad consequences of their experiments but most of the time they forgot the most dangerous thing of all, the human ego and selfishness."
"I love this movie so much! Its that feeling you get when you know you are watching greatness on the movie screen. It grips you from the very beginning and doesn't let go. I truly didnt feel like it was 3 hours, I could have watched more. All the actors did a wonderful job, but Cillian Murphy should be nominated for best actor for sure, and Robert Downey Jr for supporting actor. The sound effects are amazing! I truly didn't think it would be that great, I didn't have any expectations, but I'm so glad I went to see it. This movie has to be seen on the big screen so you can feel the sound. I want to thank everyone who made the awesome movie."
"Oppenheimer was a fantastic excellent and visually compelling piece of cinematic art; I saw it in IMAX. It was awe-inspiring in that format was very visual, loud, and realistic. It was really loud and really visually stunning I had to sight in the front row where it felt like you were really getting hit by an atomic It was great but I would recommend sitting in a middle row. The film overall had excellent performances from its cast, especially Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey Jr all of them were fantastic, and the IMAX experience really heightened it since it was how the film was intended to be seen instead a lower quality digital version."
"I'm going to see every Nolan movie the first chance I get, no questions asked. Not only is he the best current director but he's one of the best of all time. He's rivaling Spielberg at this point with his consistency and originality. I've loved all of his movies except Dunkirk. His movies are either action or thriller or both so I was wondering what this one was going to be like. I thought this may be his ""serious drama,"" like his Schindler's List or something, but I had no idea.Nolan is as Nolan as ever and only expands on his style. This movie is made like an action movie. It's fast, with quick cuts and pounding music. I read that with Dunkirk he wanted to maintain the same tension throughout the entire movie, I think he failed but he succeeds here. And at three hours, it's all the more impressive.The movie is jumping back and forth from many different timelines so there is never a dull moment. Nolan has done this before but never for the whole movie. The story isn't linear, and you are shown what's important for the subject at hand. Thinking about it now, I guess it does basically go in order, but there are a lot of sidetracks along the way. I wasn't sure exactly where we were in the chronology all the time, but it didn't matter because I understood what was happening.Nolan has an amazing ability to know what the audience is going to pick up on. He doesn't over explain and he doesn't under explain. Tenet put this to the test. With so much information that the human mind can't take it in in one viewing. Sorry Nolan we're just not on your level. This movie gives you a lot of info really quickly and never lets up for a second and it all makes sense. I never felt lost.The black and white was a very simple and effective way to let you know that you are in a different POV. I figured it out like half way though. Maybe a little too long but the movie doesn't give you any time to think.Of course the acting is great. And a great cast as well. A lot of familiar faces with a lot of unfamiliar. And a lot of people cast in roles you wouldn't think of them for. And a lot of people that I really like but don't even know their names. Robert Downey Jr was really good. It was good to see him in something substantial. His usual Iron Man thing he does really well, but I've soured on it. Cillian Murphy was great and it was good to see him front and center. Alden Ehrenreich is someone that I think should be better known. I've seen him in very little but this guy's got it.One of the coolest things was the delayed sound of the explosions. Realistic and scarier actually. When the nuke goes off and they're watching the fire, it's obviously a big moment, the only time the movie kind of stops, there wasn't an explosion sound. I kept waiting and waiting and it didn't come. It made me think, ""Oh, I guess they're not going to do it for dramatic effect."" Then a voice over of Oppenheimer saying, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,"" and then the explosion sound comes in was very cool.The opening quote, ""Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to man. For this he was chained to a rock and tortured for eternity."" Was very good and set up the direction of the movie. Usually quotes happen and you don't know what the hell their relevance is.The part that really sticks out is the end. The close up of Oppenheimer as Einstein is talking to him is very cool. And he says something like, they'll forgive you but it won't be for you, it'll be for them was kinda scary and an ah-ha moment. This scene is built up very well because it's in the movie a few times and you don't know what was said and you want to know, so when you finally get to hear it, it's not what you thought and it's very true. And it's true to what happened to Oppenheimer.This was a very important story about a very important man. I'm 37 years old and I didn't know much about him. People I talk to don't either. So I'm assuming that most people are in the same boat. I knew he made the A bomb and that he might have regretted it. The complexity of his character and his thoughts about making the bomb feel very realistic.For generations like mine and a few others who grew up in a nuclear world, I found it interesting to see how much this changed the world and the fear of the intellectuals of what this would create. And the nativity of the politicians and military is scary. I don't know if the scene with Truman is accurate but if it is, it's scary. But then of course their thinking to end the war makes sense. And it did work, it did end the war.Who knows what Oppenheimer could have accomplished if Lewis Strauss didn't screw him over because of a personal vendetta? He could have advocated for responsible use of weapons of mass destruction or who knows? A man of this intelligence wasn't allowed to rise to his full potential and cash in on his accomplishments because of a petty individual.It was strange to see a three hour, drama as a summer blockbuster. That alone was a blast from the past. I can't wait to see it again."
"I went to the 10:45PM showing in IMAX and was surprised that it was nearly sold out.I was delighted to see that there were people of various ages there eagerly awaiting Nolan's latest.Within 20 min I knew I was watching an instant classic. I felt much the same way when I viewed Momento over 20 years ago.Oppenheimer has set the bar for storytelling of historical figures and events. Personally I was always drawn to the story of The Manhattan Project and the potential horrors of its aftermath.At times I was in awe, laughed, learned, and boarded on tears.Everyone in attendance was there because of Mr Nolan , their familiarity with the subject matter or both. I hope this film reaches a wide audience in a summer filled with Barbie and Mission Impossible.When Oppenheimer was over the majority of the Audience clapped and left the theater in a manner I haven't noticed since Schindlers List.I sat in my car and just thought. Yes this movie will compel you to think.Robert Downey reminds us that he truly is a great actor. He'll get a supporting actor nomination. Mr Murphy Best actor.Oppenheimer will get nods for Best director, adapted screenplay, cinematography, sound design, editing and YES Best Picture.Kudos Mr Nolan the bar has been set."
"Films like Oppenheimer are the reason to go to a cinema to enjoy a film to the maximum. Perhaps at the end of the year it will turn out that Oppenheimer will be the best film that 2023 has produced and if not it will definitely end up in the top 3. Do not expect a film with a lot of action, because Oppenheimer has become a biographical film with a lot of dialogues and political issues in it. They are Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. They impress in the film, but the rest of the cast also does an excellent job under the wing of Christopher Nolan. The soundtrack may not be as memorable as Tenet's or let alone Interstellar (of course Interstellar was made by Hans Zimmer), but all the elements are on board and the crackle of the Geiger counter under the music really adds power and gets completely under the skin. If you get the chance to visit the film in IMAX, it is absolutely recommended, but if there is no IMAX theater nearby, the regular silver screen will also suffice. In any case, Oppenheimer is a film that you should not miss in the cinema, because you will spend three hours watching this feat in amazement."
"This is more a rant than a review,The short...go watch this...if you're a fan of Nolan's or Biopics...its worth a go.The long...Oppenheimer is essentially 3 films (shorts) edited into a coherent narrative. The three periods are before, during and after the main event and each period has its own colour pallet, a subtle visual que that definitely helps.This movie has so much to unpack.The dialogue is rich and every interaction is important. Character arcs, development and moments so satisfying, played by a talented and competent cast.Apparently all effects are practical...and the way some were used to show how he experienced the world made for very intense scenes.The score belongs to whatever category has the one for Arrival in it . Sound and at times the complete lack of it, is so carefully placed its feels inspired.6 out of 10 because maybe there was too much going on and this isnt going to be for everyone. Even though I recommend it, I'd be hard pressed to watch it again.*Thoughts on Florence Pugh's character
Its the scenes shes in that seem colour saturated...the vibrant colours could be how he saw her. The road not taken...the life he wanted but couldn't have because she couldnt decide if she wanted him and everyone but her told him it was his responsibility to lend his skill and intelligence to what they thought to be a higher calling."
"Massive Nolan fan, TDK, inception and interstellar among my top 10 films, with others not far behind.Oppenheimer is well acted, looks great, but my god it's boring.I've rewatched all of Nolan's film over an over, but I will only put myself through Oppenheimer once.It's just does nothing to pull you in, the subject matter is obviously significant and important, I just think it would be better served as a documentary than a 3 hour film. The characters and story in this film are just not that interesting. I didn't care about anyone.It's a real disappointment, and no one is more upset about this than me."
"I'm 45, worked in military roles in the 90s, I understand the gravity and horror of the implications of nuclear attack / war more than most. I watched this in a quiet cinema on a midday showing, two teenage lads close by watched too, deeply curious yet not understanding what the true horror of an atomic detonation meant. Watching this movie reminded me of why humanity must, must always realise just what nuclear weapons are, and can do, and what corruption this infinite power to obliterate brings.Like many others, I adore Nolan's works, but this feels truly seminal. There's something about this movie that feels as if he and everyone involved have given life and soul to make it something truly extraordinary. And it is.It is a long film but it could easily have been double the three hours as Oppenheimer is such an extraordinary human being he deserves so much more investigation.What a brilliant, evocative, brilliant and terrifying movie."
"The acting in Oppenheimer is outstanding, from the top of the cast, through supporting actors, to the nearly and actually uncredited.Unfortunately, Christopher Nolan felt it necessary to remind us that the film is about The Bomb every three minutes. The special effects were very well done, but maybe deserving of its own Oscar (who's going to out-soecial-effect an atomic bomb?)Apparently Nolan didn't trust his cast enough to carry the film, which was a huge error. Nolan's direction of the cast, and their performances would have been enough to win a Best Picture without any more than a single flash of light and a BOOM. Let's just hope the incessant booms and overexposures don't wear out the Oscar committee."
"The performances and the effects are truly spectacular, the story of Oppenheimer is the most important story in the history of mankind and I think it was brilliantly handled by Nolan, the layers of each sequence was amazing and the scenes of the atomic bomb were chilling, the silence filling up the space where Oppenheimer felt the most anxiety and the score was truly amazing. The greatest part of this film in my opinion is the ending because never has another film had a message that had such a real message that is prevalent to this day. We do live on the edge of a nuclear knife and the sheer horror in his eyes was truly horrifying."
"Yes.... it was a long movie, 3 hours! But very informative and based on true story. I was glad to learn so much detail of an important history. Very well written script and great acting. So many emotional scenes and the casts really portrait these characters perfectly.Yes.... it was a long movie, 3 hours! But very informative and based on true story.

"In a steady and focused pace, Nolan tells the tail of the man who gave his country a superweapon and whose reputation was compromised by an envious government official. Politics, science, emotions, even humor build op this epic. As far as I am concerned, already a classic. I wonder how many Oscars this movie is going to collect. Cillian Murphy plays the role of his life. Robert Downey j.r. Must win the Oscar for hus role as Lewis Strauss, what a performance! The always sympathetic Matt Damon plays a very convincing hard boiled army general. And finally, Emily Blunt, IS the convincing wife of Oppenheimer, a person not to meddle with. Masterpiece."
"In Christopher Nolan's 2023 film 'Oppenheimer', audiences are treated to a masterful cinematic experience that delves into the life and work of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the 'father of the atomic bomb.' The film is a meticulously crafted biographical drama that explores the complexities of Oppenheimer's character and the moral dilemmas faced during the creation of the world's most destructive weapon.Uncharacteristic of Nolan's filmography, 'Oppenheimer' delivers its narrative through quiet nuances that demand the audience's attention and engagement. For instance, a poignant scene where Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) wordlessly observes the destructive potential of his creation, the atomic bomb, beautifully captures this subtlety. The scene speaks volumes about Oppenheimer's internal turmoil, showcasing Nolan's skill in visual storytelling.The performances in 'Oppenheimer' are nothing short of stellar. Oscar-worthy turns from Robert Downey Jr. And Emily Blunt powerfully anchor the film, with Downey Jr.'s nuanced portrayal of his character adding a remarkable depth to the narrative. Emily Blunt's performance is equally compelling, delivering a magnetic charisma that captivates the audience. Despite her limited screen time, Florence Pugh makes a significant impact, further demonstrating her impressive range as an actress.In his first leading role in a Nolan film, Cillian Murphy delivers an extraordinary performance that is both deeply nuanced and profoundly moving. His portrayal of Oppenheimer is so compelling, it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role. Murphy's performance is a masterclass in character depth that deserves an Oscar nomination.Unlike many of Nolan's previous films, 'Oppenheimer' is less about pyrotechnics and more about the character study at its heart. This dialogue-driven narrative creates a palpable tension that simmers throughout the film, giving it explosive energy even in the absence of literal explosions. This thoughtful approach elevates the film to a higher plane of storytelling, making Oppenheimer a richly rewarding cinematic experience.The screenplay, crafted with meticulous attention to detail, is another impressive aspect of 'Oppenheimer'. It blends historical facts with a deeply personal narrative, creating an engaging and thought-provoking story. The dialogue is packed with meaning, driving the narrative forward and revealing layers of character depth.This film's success highlights the critical role of writers in the film industry, particularly in light of the recent SAG-AFTRA strike. The strike underscores the need for fair compensation and treatment of writers whose creativity and labor are integral to the production of quality films like 'Oppenheimer'. Without their invaluable contribution, cinema would lack the richness, diversity, and depth that audiences around the world cherish.The film's one shortcoming, however, lies in the sound score. While the score itself is magnificent, its volume often overshadows the dialogue, making it challenging to discern what the characters are saying at times. This sometimes gives the impression that the characters are mumbling, detracting slightly from the overall experience.Despite this minor issue, 'Oppenheimer' stands as a testament to Nolan's vision and the cast's stellar performances. It is a thought-provoking, character-driven film that cements Nolan's status as one of today's most visionary directors."
"Great performances (obviously) and visually stunning (nothing new here. It's a Nolan film after all). What really had an immense emotional impact on me was the score (well done Göransson) and the soundscape as well as the use of silence. Very effective (and affective), very intense. Brilliantly executed.On the Trinity test scene:Nolan did a (in my opinion) very clever thing playing with viewer expectations during that Trinity test scene. I am - of course - talking about the use of silence during that part of the film, which I think worked really well.The entire build-up to the detonation is incredibly intense. This is in large part accomplished through score and soundscape. The tension is growing continuously throughout these moments, having you - quite literally - on the edge of your seat and then, when they hit the infamous red, round button: Silence. A silence that is in fact so deafening, that it felt like the entire audience was holding their breath. This is of course also more truthful to how this would play out in actuality. The immense blast needing time to reach the people watching from afar. Still, these moments do feel prolonged and are void of any score or soundscape save for someone (presumably Oppenheimer himself) calmly breathing. This is a conscious, stylistic choice on Nolan's part. All you get now are visuals. It's beautiful, almost peaceful. At the same time you're still in a state of immense tension that has been building up throughout the past minutes. You're almost waiting for the destructive force of the blast to hit you. You need that sort of release. And when it finally hits you, it really hits you. Not only in an ""awe-inspiring-force-of-nature"" sort of way, but also - emotionally - in an ""oh-my-god-what-have-we-done"" kind of way. Especially with the festive, cheerful scenes that immediately follow the detonation. Oppenheimer, with all of his conflicted feelings written on his face, very much in the middle of it.Very well executed and a great example for how silence can sometimes be just as important and significant as sound.The appropriately implied social and political criticism concerning (nuclear) weapons as well as their disruptive and destructive use by military and state is as relevant as ever.I would've loved to see a bit more of Jean Tatlock and her political activity but Oppenheimer is genuinely a fantastic film and a great biopic that will stay with me for quite some time.It's long though. Brace yourselves."
"In his latest masterpiece, Christopher Nolan brings the life of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer to the big screen with exceptional performances from an ensemble cast. Through astounding visual effects and practical in-camera techniques, Nolan delivers a cinematic experience that immerses viewers into Oppenheimer's world. While requiring multiple viewings to grasp its nuances, Oppenheimer remains a must-watch for cinephiles who appreciate the artistry behind filmmaking. With a perfect balance between hero and villain, the characterization of Oppenheimer tugs at the audience's emotions, leaving them invested throughout the three-hour journey. Despite minor sound mix issues, Nolan's exploration of history and science makes Oppenheimer a thought-provoking and visually spectacular cinematic delight. 🎬"
"Watched it twice now. It's definitely a very very good movie technically, amazing cinematography, brilliant acting from everyoneBut at least in my opinion, the whole story is just quite meh I guess. I could summarise the story in a paragraph without missing many details.Oppenheimer was a Jewish, ""suspected communist"", who brought Quantum Physics to the USA. His left wing mindset brought him some scrutiny from government officials and the like. He visits many univieraities and top minds through Europe, after which he returns to the California. He is recruited to head a top secret Nuclear Bomb project at a Los Alamos, NM, where a town was created for the scientists. At Los Alamos, the many scientists argued with each other on various things, some threatened to leave and others did leave. Oppenheimer had some trouble with his security clearance due to his ""communist links."" Eventually they complete the bomb, test it, it works. The US then bombs Japan twice. Many people are happy about the bombing, but many, Oppenheimer included are torn. They had built a WMD that killed countless innocent civilians. Oppenheimer is then scrutinised, through the doing of Strauss about his ""communist links"" and views about the H-Bomb even while he wasn't a communist at all. Strauss is testified against for wrongly bringing the case against Oppenheimer. The movie then ends with Oppenheimer realising/considering the weight of what he has done.I feel strauss didn't really add anything at all to the movie. Completely remove him and nothing really changes.I know it's based on a historical event, but like it's so obvious what would happen, scientists build a WMD that's scrutinised because it can be used for evil. They use the bomb, they realise what they have potentially just done. And that's really it.It's pretty obvious to me that building a WMD would bring about some morale conundrums.I think It was much too long, the third act was almost entirely unnecessary."
"We came away from watching Oppenheimer with mixed reviews and everyone agreed the movie was confusing. First, the narrative about a famous, soft spoken American is masked by ""mood-music"" throughout most of the film. As a result, the viewer is forced to read lips in order to understand the plot. Second and typical of Nolan's films, the plot skips around to the point where it becomes difficult to follow. This Hollywood ""Hop-Scotching"" produces audio & visual enhancements, but it also shrouds the spinal message of the movie. Additionally, the film also contains dozens of actors making it impossible to track who is who and what their positions are. Oppenheimer is technically accurate but not smooth in its presentation. I would recommend to those who have't seen it to read up about Robert Oppenheimer beforehand so you can gain an appreciation of his controversial biography. Oppenheimer is worth seeing, but it'll be awhile before I'll view the film again, perhaps with captions, so I can digest what message Nolan is trying to portray. Non-fictional movies about a major historical event shouldn't be fragmented in its message, as the Trinity test suggests."
"Saw the film this evening, found a theater (one of two in Texas - they even flew in a projectionist from San Francisco) that had it in Nolan's recommended format - IMAX 70mm. I spent the week watching and listening to Manhattan project related content...here are my thoughts:1) Visually, it looks awesome. Seeing it in 70mm IMAX helped I'm sure - but the exterior shots that filled up the full picture looked awesome and really were impressive. Hopefully someday digital cameras will be able to replicate the scale and resolution so the same grand scale can be brought to indoor sequences.2) Audio - heard some reviews saying the audio was too loud, at my theater they had it set up just right I think. I could clearly hear everything and was only startled by the blast of the bombing going off when that came to screen. Like other Nolan films however there are some words that are hard to make out...even though this didn't take anything away from the picture for me - I do feel that watching this with subtitles at home would bring about a better understanding of the movie as a whole.3) Story - the first two hours were great and I could feel the whole theater was engaged. The third hour however had no action and was focused in on a big experience in Oppenheimer's life in relation to his relationship to the US government. Personally I found the final hour a bit boring but if you're into history and especially if you grew up in the Cold War then you'll find it cool and relevant.Overall I think this is on-par with Nolan's Dunkirk - his movies prior to that are legendary so don't go in expecting that and you'll leave happy. It has amazing actors/actresses and has a compelling and important story. - just didn't nuke my socks off like I expected."
"""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds""Behind the battle of countries during World War II, there was a scientist who made history and ended the war. Unfortunately, he also created a weapon of mass destruction.Robert Oppenheimer's story was unveiled thoroughly in this Christopher Nolan masterpiece. From how he got the idea to creating that idea and making history. Oppenheimer's success sadly was his tragedy as well. (SPOILERS AHEAD, well if they are) A series of hearings questioning his loyalty became his battle as he made his greatest invention. As a complicated yet a man of science, he made friends with fellow scientists. But his idea of this ""ultimate weapon"" also made him work with the military which was later used against him. His friends, colleagues soon turned against him. Notably, Lewis Strauss was the villain of his story, hiding in the shadows but already plotting on destroying not only his reputation but his life as a whole. Despite winning on having Oppenheimer lose his security clearance, Strauss still failed to secure the votes he needed to be a part of Eisenhower's cabinet. Thus, Oppenheimer is regarded as ""Father of the Atomic Bomb.""The drama, the suspense, the thrill, the story, the science, the execution, everything in this movie is a masterpiece. Nolan knows what he's doing and he did it right. Cillian Murphy's performance as the great scientist was spot on. RDJ being the villain of this story was well executed as well and the whole ensemble cast was amazing in this film.Shot in IMAX cameras, this movie is really BEST SEEN in IMAX theaters (but it won't be in 3D).Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a 9.5/10 for me. Before or after watching the movie, do research for it to be understood more.""It won't be for you. It will be for them.""
-Albert Einstein to J Robert Oppenheimer."
"Despite being 3 hours long, I thought this was a fast thriller that had me on the edge of my seat. The visuals are amazing, as always, and Cillian does such an amazing job to represent a mysterious character that gets caught in the middle of a very complicated moral debate.There's no question that the bombs in Japan were horrendous war crimes, but the film makes you debate on whether you understand the decisions made or you just despise them. It's a rollercoaster of emotions and a psychological challenge.The part where the bomb is being tested is so nervewrecking and felt so real, as if the bomb was being tested right in front of us, and can possibly destroy all humanity. My favorite scene is Openheimers speech after the bomb on Hiroshima, where he sees the consequences of his actions and the damage he has done to those people. Such a cruel way to show the destruction of those bombs.You can clearly see an evolution in Openheimers character who starts as a very confused cientist, who doesn't know in what political party he believes and has little to no character. On the contrary , in the end he's more aware of his place and knows how to stand for himself."
"Full disclosure this might be a slightly biased review, I am a confessed Christopher Nolan super fan. This being my personal most anticipated film of the year I was expecting big things!I'm gonna get straight to the point! This is NOT one of Chris Nolan's best films! I know shocking right. After seeing ""Oppenheimer"" and giving it a day to marinade in my head, I came to this conclusion. I have a few issues with the film. Firstly is far far too long. Even for Nolan this is taking it to the extreme, 3 hours felt almost like 4 and a half! The other issue I have is the amount of time spent with Oppenheimer's early life as a student. I didn't feel that we needed to spend as much time as we did in that part of his life, I didn't serve much of a purpose! Could have easily chopped off 30 minutes, may have made the pacing slightly better too.However with all that being said this is still an incredible achievement for cinema. If this is the standard of one of Nolan's weaker films then we really are a spoiled audience. Just because, for personally, he doesn't hit the heights of some of his other films doesn't mean this is terrible or awful. Some filmmakers could only dream of making a film like this.Everything about the production, majority of the story, acting, effects and sound is truly remarkable. Especially the fact that Universal gave Nolan a huge budget and bascially said go have fun! Thank you for giving us this experience!I could list every single actor in this film because they are all absolutely amazing, however there is only one that deserves a bit more praise. That is of course Cillian Murphy. A performance that will go down as career defining!!!!Overall this film is a lot to make of and trust me it'll need a second viewing to truly appreciate and understand what Nolan is trying to achieve. For me it isn't one of his best though, due to its absurd length and unimportant focus on Oppenheimer's early student life. I'll give it a light 80% out of 100 !In a strange way I don't see myself rushing to watching it again for a while, it is quite a physical and mental experience to go through. Maybe that is the point!"
"""Oppenheimer"" proves that exceptional storytelling still exists amidst the mediocrity often dominating our screens. The film's three-hour runtime is masterfully paced, seeming to soar by in no time, an impressive feat that emphasizes the riveting plot and engaging narrative.The dialogue in the film is an exquisite display of intelligent scripting. It's not just engaging but offers food for thought, sparking intellectual pleasure that can sometimes be absent from modern cinema. This quality dialogue enhances our connection to the characters, making their struggles and victories resonate deeply.The test explosion scene is a tour de force in cinematic craftsmanship. The filmmakers successfully blend art and science, creating a spectacle that is as visually mesmerizing as it is symbolically profound. It's a scene that encapsulates the awe, terror, and destructive beauty of humanity's tampering with the elemental forces of the universe.Perhaps the most unexpected source of suspense lies in the political fallout that follows the test. It's a nail-biting sequence of events, subtly exploring the impact and consequences of such revolutionary scientific achievement. The exploration of power dynamics and political manipulation is expertly woven into the narrative, further enriching the viewing experience.In summation, ""Oppenheimer"" is a refreshing antidote to the more disposable content of today. It's a compelling blend of intellectual stimulation and emotional resonance, expertly brought to life through remarkable performances, adept direction, and stunning cinematography. In an era where the mundane often takes center stage, this film serves as a beacon, reminding us of the true potential of cinema."
"This movie, about J. Robert Oppenheimer and his role in the development of the atomic bomb, is a great drama movie!This is one of the most technically amazing movies I have ever watched. Wow! The cinematography, the sound and the practical effects made sure for a fantastic visual pleasure. All of these aspects combined with the outstanding soundtrack by composer Ludwig Göransson spiced up the already-impressive scenes even more. Speaking of the chemical reaction-scenes, they were incredibly epic! The sounds shook the seats, and the visuals were both beautiful and terrifying at the same time. I loved they way the movie showed how powerful this bomb was, and how destructive it could be. I have to admit that I expected more scenes of the those chemical reactions, to be honest, but I really enjoyed what I got.The acting was fantastic. I almost didn't think about the characters as actors at all, and that says something. I personally think the cast was perfect, and they without doubt made sure to make the story feel as authentic as possible.I think the storyline was well executed. Most of it was about the actual development of the atomic bomb where we saw an ambitious, motivated and confident Oppenheimer, but after the detonation on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Oppenheimer realized the devastating effects of it. He hid in the shadows filled with guilt and, but also with the feeling of getting blood on his own hands. Oppenheimer's co-workers had faith and supported him during the development, but some of them were also using him for his competence. Oppenheimer then became Death, the destroyer of the worlds.The story was mainly about Oppenheimer's subjective experience as a common man, but also the objective perspective of him as an important physicist. These two perspectives combined created a complex story that was often hard to fully understand, but also both very interesting and something one needs discuss after watching. There was a lot to take from the beginning of the second act, but things got clearer in the end. Speaking of the 3-hour runtime, I got a small feeling that I was watching a long movie, but I think that's mostly because I didn't understanding everything. There were lots of interesting lines and statements from the characters, and I wish I could fully process every single word to get the whole picture of the story. Anyway, I think a rewatch would most likely clear things up a little more.Overall, this is a technically impressive and thought-provoking drama that explores the complex moral and ethical implications of the development of the atomic bomb. The movie is beautifully shot and features outstanding performances from the cast. While the three-hour runtime can be a bit daunting, the movie is ultimately rewarding and leaves viewers with a lot to think about."
"I'm not gonna lie and say I was 100% excited for Oppenheimer because I wasn't at first, I remember seeing the trailer in the cinema and thinking ""yeah I'm gonna watch that one day"" anyway the whole Barbenheimer thing happened and my hype grew for the film (more for Barbie if I'm being honest) but I just left the cinema and wow.It is a masterpiece, it's so well crafted that it didn't even feel as though I was sat there for three hours, I watched it in IMAX and I feel as though you need to in order to fully appreciate Oppenheimer. The sound is mixed so we'll (which is usually the opposite when it comes to a Nolan film) and the performances of every character is marvellous."
"Comic books, Marvel, Remakes, Franchises, and garbage is the norm.No, Oppenheimer is not perfect, but what people who criticize it fail to reach is that it's a rare type of movie these days. It's a historical true story, biopic, and character study. It will also be a frontrunner for Best Picture that will surpass in quality if it wins all Best Picture winners of the last ten years in terms of importance and meaningfulness.Now, with that being said, here is why it is crucial. Heisenberg was the key factor.My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.-Heisenberg."
"A star-studded cast brings a very interesting although dialog heavy presentation of the trials of J Oppenheimef and his role in creating the automic bomb. The cast delivers stellar performances but the movie drags on partly because it is so thick in content and dialog, but also because as usual with a Nolan film, will likely require a second viewing to get all the nuances. Both it's strength and it's weakness, is the subject matter about the controversies surrounding the atomic boom: it will seem like an old rehash by many viewers, and like a fresh look to others. In either case, the acting and writing presents excellent and fresh content about the life and trials of Oppenheimer."
"Well, it is definetly the most capable Nolan has been writing-wise without the help of his brother.The more abstract sequences, such as Oppenheimer's recurring visions and Kitty's struggle with his affair are also welcome additions, even though they make up very little of the runtime. Actually got me wondering how Nolan would handle an erotic thriller.Unfortunately, the rest is still typical Nolan.Cold, unevenly paced with no sense of where to let the narrative breathe, dumping exposition at every opportunity, matter-of-fact filmmaking with little interest to go beyond the surface and above all, needlessly muddling with timelines so as to appear more complex. Shooting in black and white for ""Strauss's point of view"" was also completely unnecessary, as there is no other point of view or playing with an unreliable narrator, it's just the factual retelling of events, but in black and white.It is very much just a biography transferred into the medium of film, keeping focus on events instead of people, missing a lot of opportunities to emotionally engage the viewer.This might be enough for a lot of people who just like to learn about someone's life, but it absolutely isn't for me.At least the final act somewhat manages to convey a very important lesson:The line between hero and villain is always ambiguous. It all depends on where powerful people decide to put their blind spots."
"Before even providing my thoughts I will say watching this is a mental exercise in itself. Not only is it 3 hours, but it fires information at you the entire time. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing, but there will almost certainly be times where you are trying to figure out which character is which when they refer to them by name. Perhaps we could have got to know a couple of the key players better rather than getting lost in the static. Another aspect the viewer must deal with is trying to piece the timeline together on the fly. It's not that difficult once you get into it, but nevertheless a nuisance at times. It might be a movie where you get a lot more value on the second watch through, but at the same time it's hard to envision giving up another 3 hours to do so.On the other hand some things are done extremely well. The cinematography is stunning, and Murphy is great as expected. In the trailer I thought Matt Damon was out of place but was pleasantly surprised with the performance. The score also hits well.Overall I was satisfied with the end product, but whether fair or not I tend to hold Christopher Nolan to a higher standard based on his ability to include all essential elements of cinema while still being able to tell an interesting story. This is good work, but not his best."
"At this point I'm sort of in awe at just now much Christopher Nolan is able to put his own stamp on every single genre he touches. Oppenheimer is a 3-hour long dialogue driven character drama but it still has all of the jaw dropping spectacle of The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception and Dunkirk. The film just starts at a speed of 100 miles an hour and just keeps at that pace for the entire runtime and I can honestly say couldn't get enough of what Oppenheimer was offering.Nolan's obviously so well regarded for jaw dropping visuals and this film is no different; the constant shifts between colour and black-and-white never feel jarring but instead purposeful and gorgeously realised. The trinity test scene is as mind blowing as it was built up to be. It's basically a perfect sequence that I can honestly say left me in awe, everything from the visuals, the tension, the little character moments and the performance come together for what I'm sure is going to go down as one of Nolan's all timer scenes. There are very few times I can say my jaw dropped in a theatre but this genuinely was one of them.But I have to say the movie is just as good from a script perspective as it is from a visual one. The dialogue here is unbelievable, it's almost Shakespearean in how prophetic and atmospheric it is mixed with a good amount of dry humour Nolan's become known for. The script also does a very good job at condensing decades of history into a 3 hour runtime, it's definitely a lot to take in and can be overwhelming at points but despite the quick pace you really do feel the immense passage of time and toll that's being taken on the characters. That's not always easy to do visually and I'm amazed at how well this movie pulled it off.I was initially disappointed with the rather factual title of Oppenheimer but having seen the film now it's very clear why Nolan chose it. Every single scene features him in some way, shape or form, even when he's not on screen he's usually the topic of conversation and by the end of the film you really do feel like you've seen an entire life play out on screen.Cillian Murphy is absolutely incredible in this movie, I genuinely could not imagine anyone else playing Nolan's version of this person. He's very subtle and withdrawn for large portions and since Oppenheimer himself was such a flawed person Murphy has a lot that he has to convey emotionally and he hits every single beat perfectly. There's only a few select scenes where the characters psyche starts to break down and they happen just infrequently enough that they leave a lasting impression and that's something I appreciated about all the performances. They didn't feel the need give everyone an Oscar scene or moment; the outbursts are few and far between and most of the work is more subtle and poignant.When I say that the film starts at a break neck pace I very much mean that as a positive and a negative. I can honestly say I was never bored but I'd also be lying if I didn't say that I wished Nolan would've let some scenes breathe a bit more. A lot of scenes feel like protracted montages and felt like we were flying through scenes so fast that I didn't always have time to register the information and in some cases the emotional beats Nolan was trying to give off.Nolan works again with the same editor as he did with Tenet and I thought the editing in that film was particularly poor and while it's much improved here it still occasionally feels choppy and too quick cut for its own good. Even if it meant the film was longer I kept wishing Nolan would slow down and let some of these scenes breathe more because all my favourite scenes in the film feel like they have that space to play out in a more organic way.Oppenheimer might not quite crack top 5 Nolan for me but honestly it's not far off. You have an incredible performance from Cillian Murphy at the centre that ties everything together beautifully, it's just as good on the page as it is on the screen and as break neck as the pace was it never once lost my full attention. This felt refreshingly different for Nolan without ever losing his signature stylistic choices that make him so successful. I'll be seeing it again in a few weeks and this is the first film I'll ever be seeing in IMAX and I could not think of a better one to start out on."
"Just returned from the cinema, soaked from the rain, but my mind is still captivated by the masterpiece I just witnessed. Christopher Nolan has once again exceeded all expectations with this film, leaving me in awe during the entire 20-minute walk back home.The combination of an exceptional cast and mesmerizing soundtracks perfectly brought Nolan's vision to life. I can't help but hope that Murphy receives the Oscar he truly deserves for his outstanding performance.Admittedly, if you're not familiar with the historical context of the film's topic, you might feel a bit lost or uninterested. However, I assure you it's still worth watching for its sheer brilliance and cinematic prowess. Nolan has once again proven himself as a master storyteller, making this film an experience not to be missed."
"One of the few movies that I will suggest someone to watch to fall in love to cinema and movies!Thanks you Nolan for this deep exotic experience that made me check my schedule by the end of the movie to book another ticket in coming days, because watching this art piece once I'm sure is not enough.Thank you great actors and behind the scenes team for the performance, and without all of you, this masterpiece will not be completed.At the end, to make your experience more completed in my point of view is to read about the atomic bomb from scientific side, because this what I felt I'm behind at :))"
"It took me long enough to write this review, by now I've seen Oppenheimer 2 times at the cinema and I've come to the conclusion that Nolan is simply the best. He seems to be one of the few directors in history that keeps experimenting and tries to do something new for each of his movies and still keeps some sort of style in which you can recognise at any given time that you're watching a Nolan film. Very few directors get to actually get all the actors they'd like to have for their movies and Nolan gets to do it every time.This time for Oppenheimer he takes a bit from each of his previous movies to construct this one. After not having a developed protagonist for his previous 2 films, he goes all out for this one as Cillian Murphy really becomes Oppenheimer and you get to experience with him his rise, fall, guilt, sadness and so many other emotions as he goes through his journey of becoming the most important man in the world. The cast is amazing, filled with great performances with Downey Jr and Damon as standouts. The music is great and gives so much impact to the important moments and makes them fill somehow epic, it helps build up tension and releases you when not needed.Overall It is one of the most complete movies ever done by Nolan and it resonates with the international tension in the world today between Russia and USA. It is definitely the best film of the year so far, one of the best in the last decade or so and one of the most important films in the century."
"Oppenheimer is an interesting movie from Christiopher Nolan. It feels like him, yet not at all. The idea of tackling a real-life event and one of the most important geopolitical events in the history of man is so far from what I think of when I think of Nolan, yet the way it´s made makes it something just down his line. While not perfect, Oppenheimer delivers a thrilling and dark part of human history that is so interesting to follow and his full of emotions throughout.J. Robert Oppenheimer, the self-proclaimed father of the atom bomb is being questioned about his national security. At the same time the cabinet member Lewis Strauss is giving his two cents about Oppenheimer. We see everything of Oppenheimer's life, from his humble beginnings to the creation and reflection on the atom bomb.A thing I didn't expect this movie to be was a strong court drama. This is an incredibly tense movie where it´s mostly people talking and interrogating each other. While the movie is also about much more, the political aspect is in the forefront and the entire way of thinking in the atom age is called to question. How the American government wanted to make more weapons, how Oppenheimer delt with the creation of the atom bomb, a lot of moral questions that are all in a grey area. No one seems to be completely right here, even Oppenheimer is throwing away responsibility for what the atom bomb would be used for, instead of seeing himself as a ring in the water. The character assassination of Oppenheimer is interesting to hear, and the story is compelling.The character of Oppenheimer is very well done in this movie, yet I had some issues with it. I never felt like I got under the skin of Oppenheimer. I never really learned what he thought of anything, and he deflects most question thrown his way. This was a smart decision to me though, not leaving Oppenheimer as a character that was always right but leaving the viewer making their own opinion of the events happening. This neutrality isn't kept for all characters though, and this leave Oppenheimer in a more favourable position automatically. I wished the movie had worked more in greys.This movie has some incredible artistic shots and scenes that really impacted me. The lead up and the test bombing. The speech in the gym, the entire 3. Act court drama, the ending. All left me really feeling and truly showed the talented acting of Nolan. This movie is carried by strong performances, a strong score and some really incredible ideas that just really hit me the right way.I most admit though, the first act of this movie I found rather weak. The personal life of Oppenheimer, especially his romance, feels highly unnecessary for the movie. His ties to the communist party will be important later for the story but it feels misplaced in the beginning somehow. The pacing is also something you have get used to. This movie is edited and moves very fast. It becomes better later, but in the beginning, I had a hard time following along.This movie has an all star cast and everyone gives it their all. Every single performance is absolutely incredible, and everyone sold their emotions and characters to me. Everyone really disappeared into their role, and I really got emersed into this movie. My favourite performance was no doubt Robert Downey Jr. As Strauss. What a powerful performance from start to finish, what a wide range of emotions that had to be captured, what a captivating performance through and though. It´s been a while since I saw such a strong performance from an actor and RDJ deserves all the praise he can for this role, but as said, everyone hits it out of the park in this one. Although as a Dane I found the attempt at a Danish accent laughable.This movie wears it´s political stance on its sleeves yet observes it from afar. It reminds me of the ending of Don´t look up (2021) in that way, but instead the entire movie. Oppenheimer starts a humble physicist who just want to work with fission and fusion, then when he gets to work on it, although through warfare, he is excited until he sees what he has created. The journey of a physicist that most accept what he has done is interesting and the later political assassination of Oppenheimer really hammers home the changed geopolitical world we live in and have to really have to address one way or another in the future.The score is incredible in this movie and really feels like a part of it´s identity. It feels constant in the background and really underlines everything going on in the movie. Especially the buildup to the testing is phenomenal as well as that entire scene. Pure tension and art.Oppenheimer really surprised me to what it would be in a good way. The story and reflection to our time of living really hit me and the story I didn't know was interesting. This is a strong artistic movie with so many incredible aspects. It´s not perfect but has these absolutely incredible aspects that makes it such a strong experience."
"Watch in Imax... you will be blown away.This is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time, definitely close to top on my favorites. Cillian Murphy establishes himself as an A-list from this performance alone.Nolan's creative directing style in this movie was unbelievably grasping. How he told this biography makes every single second of this movie exciting. The acting by every single actor helps create this amazing movie. RDJ delivers one of his best performances in years. The cast Nolan got for this movie will have you in disbelief that they are all in this same movie together.This movie deserves every award from directing, acting, sound, effects, etc. 10/10 and no other acceptable answers."
"I just watched ""Oppenheimer"" and it is a masterpiece. I am not a huge of fan of history nor biography movies, but this movie made me reconsider all my life choices.""Oppenheimer"" started off with a quick pace, which most movies just ignore. The acting performance was on a high level. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Both deserve an academy award. Also, shoutout to the casting team. I did some research and the actors almost identical to whom they portray. And don't get me started on cinematography...
I am a fan of Christopher Nolan and I know how much he can do, but I definitely was not expecting such great job. This is a work of art."
"I think we're getting used to Christopher Nolan's movie making style now.Fantastic visuals with a strong, loud soundtrack that seems just enough out of place but actually works with rest of the material.I wasn't quite sure what to expect with Oppenheimer. How would Nolan approach a subject that yes, has had a profound effect on the world we live in but to many movie goers, might seem a bit of dull subject. The answer is somewhat of a lesson in abstract film making.Initially opening with popping visuals and loud soundtrack, the movie jumps around in time. These periods come more in the forms of itemised memories rather than scenes. They focus on Oppenheimer before, during and after the Manhattan Project and his struggles with his passions and his morals.Some scenes have a very abstract, artistic feel to them with a deluge of black and white for good measure.Through all of this, i didn't feel that i got to know anything about Oppenheimer himself.At times i felt myself fighting the music that never seems to relent. Scenes filled with technical dialogue that have a brooding, building soundtrack that at times made the dialogue inaudible.I will admit though that i did enjoy the movie. It is something to say that you've seen but there is little to no re-watch value in it.If you want Nolan action, this isn't it. This is something that Nolan clearly has an interest in and is now at a point in his career that he can make anything without question."
"Actors are doing good in this movie, however Nolan makes worse and worse movies lately. Half of the movie is COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY! What is even worse, the unnecessary part is the more interesting. Because what is the main plot? Some jealous scientists beef, what they are trying to solve with shady political backstabbing. That's it. The movie is 3 hours long, and the Manhattan-project is only a side-story, because Oppenheimer met with Strauss AFTER the war. I feel the movie wanted to grab too much: a little bit of documentary, a little bit of spy movies, and drama. But because of this, it can't achieve a good result any of these fields. And let's talk about, the movie is a 3 hours long dialogue between characters, without any pause. Camera change every 3 seconds. Maybe I'm too European, but come on, where were the long shots? Music? I know, Nolan didn't work with Hans Zimmer this time, but I cannot recall any music from the movie, everything what they played was just annoyed more me, because it was just stuffing more and more into the movie without any reason. Only good part of the movie are the actors, who did very good, but good actors can't save the sinking ship. I don't understand the hype around this movie, when its clearly has huge-huge problems."
"Just Brilliant, so intense from start to finish so much so you don't even realise you've been sitting for 3 hrs it's does not feel like that at allThe only slight issue I had was the trinity test explosion scene it was all leading up to that and I feel like I was underwhelmed I know he doesn't like using cgi but I feel like the silence then the effects didn't represent what I thought a atomic bomb would be like and didn't go on very long either, perhaps cgi would have been helpful to truely blow us away as I knew this scene had to illustrate what has now changed for all of us and the dramatic consequences of pressing the button and using oneOther than that utterly brilliant, highly recommended!"
"I should start by saying that whilst I've seen and enjoyed much of Nolan's work, I've long been waiting for the film of his that I truly loved. Oppenheimer is that film.Cillian Murphy is amazing in the lead role and is excellently supported by a star studded cast. A special mention to Robert Downey Jr who is almost unrecognisable in the role of Lewis Strauss.The timeline jumps about but the film is so engrossing that it's not difficult to follow the story, and although almost 3 hours long, it doesn't feel like it drags at any point.I saw it on the big screen - which I'd recommend - but can't wait for a second viewing once available on streaming platforms."
"This movie was an amazing treat. As with all Christopher Nolan movies, the filmography was excellent, audio shook you and really brought up emotions of despair and beauty in certain scenes. I watched this in an IMAX theater so all the sensory effects with amplified. The actors were amazing too.But a word of warning, please go in with the correct expectations. This is a 3 hour long movie that portrays the life of Oppenheimer through the good and bad.The only gripe I had with the movie was that the last hour could have been shortened to about 20 minutes, but that's more of a personal subjective preference.Despite the tiring 3 hour watch, its an overall an outstanding movie and will definitely stand amongst the classics against the test of time."
"Christopher Nolan breaks out of his bubble of fiction into the openness of realism. Put together: Motivation, lack of motivation, madness, genius, success, fame, conscience, regret, empathy, betrayal and many other scenarios and feelings in a single work bordering on the impossible, which the director should already know. Speaking and explicitly showing the political scenario of the Second World War era on the big screen is not an easy job, which makes it impossible to fully understand what one wants to convey through frames and scenes that are so opaque in sense, when at the same time full. The superficiality of the work has to be noted. A lot of elements were used, as there was no escape, so it makes the pace slower and more angsty, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Some things should have been more detailed, but they weren't. Cinematography? Flawless. Soundtrack? Flawless. Acting? Flawless. 8.5/10."
"Christopher Nolan gave cinema one of the most powerful and stunning biopics in history. In his 12th feature length film, Nolan takes on J. Robert Oppenheimer and his story leading, building and the aftermath of the atomic bomb. Definitely one of the best visual films in Nolans filmography and in recent cinema, ""Oppenheimer"" manages to turn one of the worlds most destructive weapons, into a mind-blowing, beautiful masterpiece. Nolan used two styles of visuals to portray the story, a first person perspective when the film was in colour and a third person perspective when it came to the black and white scenes, this helped to distinguish the difference between events for viewers especially with how much information was in the picture and really immerse the viewer in J. Robert Oppenheimer's position as these events unfolded and what he now carried with him as ""The Father of the Atomic Bomb"". I can easily say that Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Are clearly in the running for Best Actor and Supporting Actor as they both provide some of their best performances to date. However I will add that the entire cast was on their A-game anytime they were on screen. The fact that Nolan has addressed that there is no CGI used in this picture is phenomenal and after watching this film you can appreciate that so much more, everything was visually beautiful and the sound design on top of that was amazing. I have never watched a film and physically felt the magnitude of what was on screen. Every single explosion was felt as if you were in the observation area with the cast. My only issue that came with this film was the 3 hour runtime actually felt like 4. As some films manage to speed through 3 hours and leave you wanting more, this did not have that affect for me. However it is still a 5/5, it is in my top 3 for Nolan films and is definitely one I can rewatch no problem."
"Oppenheimer is a captivating drama helmed by acclaimed director Christopher Nolan and showcasing Cillian Murphy in the role of Oppenheimer as the renowned physicist overseeing the Manhattan Project-an undercover initiative during World War II to develop the atomic bomb. This thought-provoking film delves into Oppenheimer's dilemmas, ethical conflicts, and personal battles while shedding light on the political backdrop against which their groundbreaking work unfolded.Nolan's mastery of storytelling shines through in this gem, skilfully intertwining timelines, flashbacks and perspectives to present a multifaceted portrayal of Oppenheimer-a brilliant mind with his fair share of imperfections. Murphy delivers an enthralling performance as the scientist haunted by his past, tormented by his circumstances, and uncertain about what lies ahead. With subtlety and intensity, Murphy brings forth Oppenheimer's struggles-his passion, ambition, guilt, fear, and doubt-all laid bare for viewers to ponder.The film boasts an excellent supporting cast: Matt Damon embodies General Leslie Groves-the leader overseeing the project-with finesse. Florence Pugh portrays Jean Tatlock-Oppenheimer's lover with Communist sympathies-in a compelling manner that adds complexity to their relationship. Kenneth Branagh beautifully captures Niels Bohr's essence-a mentor and friend to Oppenheimer. Emily Blunt embodies Kitty Oppenheimer, Robert Oppenheimer's wife. Robert Downey Jr-portraying Lewis Strauss, the villain who tried to frame Oppenheimer as a communist. The list goes on. The actors bring a sense of depth and authenticity to their roles, making the characters truly memorable and believable.This film goes beyond being a character study; it also enters thriller territory. It showcases the challenges, obstacles, and dangers that the project faced, ranging from espionage to sabotage to almost insurmountable challenges. As the film progresses towards the moment of New Mexico's atomic test known as Trinity, the director skilfully builds up suspense and tension. Oppenheimer also explores the aftermath of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings shedding light on their consequences for Oppenheimer and the world.Visually speaking, this film is stunning. Nolan creates realistic and immersive scenes. The brilliant cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema captures the contrast between barren desert landscapes and claustrophobic laboratory settings with finesse. The score composed by Chris Fogel adds a haunting touch that enhances the film's overall mood and emotional impact. The soundtrack is the usual loud one characteristic of Nolan's movies, and it's occasionally difficult to hear what is said. But, overall, the movie's sound and music intensifies the experience. Colour is cleverly used to represent different perspectives. According to Christopher Nolan, black and white are used for the perspective of Lewis Strauss; colour is used for Robert Oppenheimer's perspective. This approach helps us, as viewers, to keep track of the complex interplay between the two characters.I'll mention a couple of drawbacks. Its length (three hours) may test some viewers' patience due to its occasionally slow-paced nature. The film assumes familiarity with physics and history and might isolate some viewers, but my advice is to sit back and allow the movie, as a whole, to wash over you; understanding the details of physics is not necessary to appreciate the story. The film doesn't extensively explore the ramifications of the bomb and provide the perspectives of its victims, which could leave some audience members disappointed or offended. There is some treatment of this, but it is fleeting compared to the rest of the material in the movie. Given that the story is a biography of Oppenheimer, this was probably appropriate, but viewers can decide about this.Oppenheimer is a movie that offers a captivating glimpse into one of the most influential and controversial individuals of the 20th century. It showcases Nolan's skills and Murphy's impressive acting abilities. It's engaging, complex, and powerful."
"Movie Oppenheimer by Director Christopher Nolan is excellent. The screenplay, acting, Direction has rekindled interest in Physics and thought process of making of atomic bomb in 1940s. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer and Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss did a great job. Matt Damon as Leslie Groves ,an engineer from MIT who went to West Point and as Lieutenant General who oversaw Manhattan project , is excellent. Emily Blunt as bored homemaker and mother of 2 kids is perfect as Oppenheimer's wife. Florence Pugh as Oppenheimer's physical weakness is good. The movie is 3 hr long and could be edited without losing content and high quality of ensemble and Direction.My favorite movie of Christopher Nolan is/was Dunkirk and now Oppenheimer ... great movie."
"What's up, Streamers? Today, it's the ""-Enheimer"" to your ""Barb-"". The other half of the internet phenomenon is a 3-hour, epic biopic from Christopher Nolan. Nolan takes his fascination with physics from the imagined worlds of Interstellar, Inception and Tenet and places it squarely in the terrifyingly real historical context of the development of the atomic bomb.In this corner, coming in at 5 ft. 10 in., it's American theoretical physicist and father of the atomic bomb - J. Robert Oppenheimer.Oppenheimer tells the story of the rise and fall of the tenacious and brilliant scientist and leader of the Manhattan Project, J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), as his team develops the atomic bomb and the subsequent personal and political fallout from it. The film tells the story through contrasting hearings that occur after the atomic bomb is used to end World War II: a hearing to strip Oppenheimer of his security clearance and the Senate confirmation hearing of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.) as Secretary of Commerce under President Eisenhower. Mushroom cloud and Communist witch-hunting hijinks ensue.For a dense historical biopic, Oppenheimer has the feeling of a taut, espionage thriller or like a psychological drama thanks to Christopher Nolan's direction. There's so much tension built up throughout the movie despite the fact that we know what happened to these people. Nolan does a really good job of connecting Oppenheimer's concerns post-development of the atomic bomb to our existential threats today. Beyond that, the budget of this movie was well-spent. There are a ton of familiar faces throughout. Even if you don't really know Cillian Murphy as a leading man, there's Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Robert Downey. Jr. And many cameos. The sound and visual effects that are used to enhance the science of creating the bomb and setting it off are amazing.At 3-hours, the movie starts to lose some steam when the focus shifts from developing the bomb to grappling with what the existence of the bomb means. This is an important and compelling question, but it is told through these competing administrative hearings that aren't as propulsive as the science driving the first part of the movie. Also, the motivations and connections between characters gets a little confusing because there are so many characters and competing interests to keep track of. Nolan does a good job of orienting the timeframes of the movie by differentiating between black and white cinematography and color and the editing keeps things moving quickly. On the other hand, there are a lot of similar looking dudes saying scientific and political jargon that it can be disorienting.Sidebar: Oppenheimer reminds me of something like There Will Be Blood except Oppenheimer, himself, isn't a complete psychopath like Daniel Plainview.Ultimately, Oppenheimer is an urgent and thrilling historical drama that makes relevant connections to our world today. Christopher Nolan puts his unique stamp on the stylish crafts and has assembled a sprawling cast. Although the movie is 3-hours long, it is edited well enough to avoid feeling slow or boring. It is worthy of a viewing on the big screen, so get a big enough box of popcorn to last you the entire runtime."
"A challenging film for sure... Not everyone's cup of tea.... I love a long and well layed film and I struggled with this one.. however I'm pleased I stuck with it.. not the best film I've ever seen.. not even the best this year, I have to say Mission Impossible was better or be it in different ways... But I stuck with it... Robert Downey Jr will win an Oscar for best supporting actor, im sure of that he was absolutely brilliant and Cillian Murphy will probably win the Oscar for his role in the film.. however I don't think it should get the nod for best film of the year, but it depends what's up against it... itIt looks and sounds fantastic on the big screen BUT it is half an hour to long... it just is... its a film you can sit and watch with company and be embarrassed by its ""nothing much happening on the screen"" bits... I liked it, I didn't love it.. won't be in a hurry to watch it again.. but im pleased I did.. if that makes any sense.."
"This must be the most overrated film of the year.Like every other typical American biographical movie, it glorifies its subject. According to Nolan, Oppenheimer is the most important person who ever lived. Really?The movie contains at least 1.5 hours of uninteresting courtroom drama.There are far too many characters.Not a single compelling dialogue about the moral impact of the bomb.The continuous music propels the film, but as a result there is zero emotional impact when needed.Excellent acting by all, though, and occasional nice directorial effects.Most ridiculous moment of the film: While having sex with Oppenheimer, Florence Pughs character randomly selects a sentence in a book in Sanskrit which just happens to be the infamous ""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"" quote."
This has to be the most Un-nolan esqe movie ever but still i cant process this a friggin masterpiece of a movie and surely deserves to be seen on the buggest screen possible. Cilllian oh cillian you genius that dead stare is peak acting with ludwig's score RDJ was Pheonmenal Matt damon emily blunt florence the cast did what they had to do. EPIC. The tension was throughout the film and thats the beauty of Chris Nolan's Filmography one of the very few directors who knows how to captivate the audience for 3 hours straight. Go ahead people you need to see this one absolute experience. And watch in IMAX.
"Directed by Christopher Nolan starring Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt & Matt Damon in leas role.The Journey of the Dead - A one line thought post watching the movieNolan travels us through the journey of the father of the atomic bomb J. Robert Oppenheimer.The movie adopts a slow pace approach so the 3 long hours will be proven fatigue but still the magic of Nolan makes us to watch till the end.Cillian Murphy as Robert Oppenheimer, when I aw the original Oppenheimer photo in wiki, Nolan had perfectly casted Cillian.Oppenheimer's agony during the process of atomic bomb formation, the grief he carries in his personal life every moment of Oppenheimer life which Nolan visioned to showcase to the audience, Cillian had given a bosting performance.Robert Downey Jr from a superhero Iron Man to an AEC head had given a decent performance.Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer wife, Matt Damon also portrays their performances in a neat manner.The 15 minutes sequence towards the end where we could see the test they incur before the final showdown was awe - inspiring.Overall Oppenheimer keeping aside the 3-hour journey, but if you are Nolan fan and if we want to know history then Oppenheimer would not be a disappointment."
"Christopher Nolan delivers an emphatic characterization of the most dreaded scientists in history with aplombMy Rating : (85/100)Oppenheimer is a deep, engrossing and captivating piece of cinema, powered by a remarkable sound design , intense drama and strong performances. It delivers a sense of horror and tension which binds the entire narrative of 3 hours, with powerful people people talking most of its runtime. This Nolan film apologetically as usual packs in a lot of information, names and complexity which might need a second viewing to get a complete understanding and may be overwhelming for people watching a Nolan film for first time. Cillian Murphy gives a performance which gives him the oscars next year. He just sinks into the character with a facile demonstration of how well versed he is with his craft. Oppenheimer might not be Nolan's best work but its one the best biopics I have seen in recent years.A gripe for me was the use of Bhagwat Gita while a character is having sex, this demeans the spiritual beliefs of Hindus to a certain extent. I could be more critical of it considering that scene wasn't necessary in the entire context of the film or it could have been hidden from the final cuts running in India. However a filmaker as huge as Nolan, could have been more sensitive to deliver such a scene. Oh I get it, its just a movie but there a difference between usual cinema and Nolan's films. We learn a lot from him filmography hence a concern. However, special mentions to Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon and Emily Blunt for their fantastic support performances in the film.Overall, Oppenheimer delivers a biopic with great and overwhelming detail, scorching score and powerful visuals of the chain reaction it lead to. There's no denying how dangerous the power could have been if it was only in the hands of the US. Now 9 countries including India and Pakistan are nuclear powers. If you want to understand the origin, then don't miss this film. Recommended.Instagram, Threads, Twitter : @streamgenx."
"We're all familiar with Chris Nolan's work and we certainly expected a lot from him in this historical film about the Manhattan Project and scientist Oppenheimer You have to think about the events and be shocked or watch it again when it is available online. Whatever the movie looked like to you, there was definitely a scene that made you feel strange in your place Especially when Oppenheimer talks to the crowd, this is the best chris' scene for me in his filmography. The mixture of it's soundtrack and the scene was so unique that you felt like you were in a horror movie... You feel very boring in the film. You feel too extended. Sometimes you don't feel like this film is about Scientist Robert. The romantic scenes were very strange Big stars ( Florence Pew & Emily Blunt ) I wish these romantic scenes would pass, not to mention Albert Einstein's scenes starring Tony Dalton I guess I felt that way... but on the other hand, because of the great acting of Killian, Robert Downey Jr. And Matt Damon at the top, I felt like in my film most of the time in the plots this Nazi rivalry and competition The making of the bomb and then the destruction of Hitler and its use against Japan was seriously very uniquely deep for this case the film was at its peak and then very uniquely playing with the time of the film Christopher Nolan brought to another era Without spoiling the story and shown very beautifully in the end it was really unique I was reminded of Memento, which is a Christopher Nolan film and this is how he plays with time without spoiling the story and very beautifully rewritten !He had problems in the end, but Nolan gave us many more unique scenes and retaliated with unique scenes such as the Trinity bomb test, the scenes of Sauntrack being wounded, and Oppenheimer's thoughts after the victory of Hiroshima and Nagasaki - These are all very unique scenes.The film deserves 8 to 9. More than this it's a loss."
"I was anxious to see this movie. So many great actors. However, the sound (whether the music or background noises) dominate the entire movie. I had a terrible time hearing the characters. To make it worse, the characters mumbled or spoke so softly that you couldn't hear them due to the dominate music. I don't know if the editors are hoping to win an academy award for best sound.Gary Oldman was only in the movie for 10 minutes but was brilliant. The only time you could actually hear the character's words.Great historical movie. Little too long as there were some scenes they could have left out.What was the need to show a sex scene during the security clearance hearings?Overall I give it an 8 out of 10 due to the acting and storyline."
"A Cinematic Symphony of Action and Emotion. As a fervent admirer of Christopher Nolan's work, I had high expectations for his latest cinematic endeavor, ""Oppenheimer,"" and I am thrilled to report that it not only met but exceeded every one of them! This captivating masterpiece weaves together a spellbinding tale of science, ambition, and humanity, cementing Nolan's position as one of the most visionary filmmakers of our time. In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a breathtaking cinematic symphony, an exquisitely woven tapestry of intellect, emotion, and history. Christopher Nolan's genius is on full display in this tour de force that showcases his exceptional storytelling, directing prowess, and unyielding commitment to the art of filmmaking. It is an absolute must-watch for cinema enthusiasts and an enduring testament to Nolan's lasting impact on the world of film."
"I'm not the type of guy to leave reviews... it's my first, but I needed to say this, this movie is my best cinema experience to date... it's simply breathtaking, the entire cinema was silenced, all sustaining their breath with the darkness of the movie... the music, the actors, the images it's simply breathtaking. The music was simply superb, it's on loop on my mind. It's a masterpiece that never feels like 3 hours long, leaving the cinema I just thought how I wanted to get back in there and watch it again. I thought the bomb scene would not surprise me and yet it did... and the final was so perfect , just go and watch it and don't loose out on this opportunity."
"As any Nolan films, you'd expect a certain amount of depth from his films, and i think this one tops it. Oppenheimer is anxiety inducing back-and-forth 'court-room' horror-esque , with majestic sound mixing. Whoever in charge of sounds, my guy deserves an OSCAR.I appreciate that Nolan centers the story around Oppenheimer as a person, and not just simply for the 'nuke'. Though, It takes a while to get a good grasp of the plotline, and i can see ways on how the first hour can be shortened as i don't think it's a necessarily needs to be a 3 hour long films.9/10.Cillian, Emily and Roberts are amazing, and also what's with these STACKED casts ??"
"Reel Tunez, The Radio Show All About the Movies - Movie Review (7/29/23): ""Oppenheimer""Lots of hype over this 3 hour movie. Yes.. it was a very good movie, but it also dragged a bit and felt more like a documentary at times.It's an interesting story.. which makes an interesting movie.. and the acting was very, VERY good. The production value was high and story flowed. But as mentioned, it did drag at times as it felt like it could have been more tightly edited to move the story along. The cinematography and scenery was beautiful, so I'd recommend it as a big screen movie.On a 1-10 scale, I'd give it a 6.5. Reel Tunez rates movies on a 1 to 10 with a point scale. Anything below a 5.0 isn't (by our rating) worth watching.. and anything over a 5.1 has merit and worth watching. Unlike some who seem to feel every movie is a 9 or a 10, getting a rating THAT high is truly ""cinematic art"" to get that score. ""Oppenheimer"" is very good and certainly worth watching."
"An intriguing character, an historic time, a chance to show what made the man whose name the film bears, squandered on an overbearing visual and audio production. Loud, building, ever-present music, probably to make up for the lack of dramatic dialogue in the script. No family back-story, none of the quirks of his character as a young man, just a series of short episodes in labs while music plays incessantly and too loudly. Jumping back and forth in time, to create a sense of mystery to demonstrate a great man taken down by pettiness. You can't make this movie without hitting some high notes and the test scene brilliant, and the sense of moral regret is well delivered. But the overall production, especially the editing, and the focus on the 'trial' and the decision to omit the early back-story years, creates a gap that is never quite filled, despite the brilliance of Cillian Murphy portraying a man struggling with the impact of what he has unleashed on the world, not to mention a host of fabulous cameos."
"While Oppenheimer is a very long movie at three hours (and often feels like it), the superb acting performance by Murphy holds your attention enough to endure it, all but ensuring his frontrunner status for Best Actor awards next year.The film has signature Nolan style, which can be both good and bad but are mostly good here. However, this is Nolan's most adult movie since Memento, as most of the consensus agrees it's his most refined and mature movie.For people who struggled to keep up with the rapid fire dialogue and timejump edits (timejumping could be the second top criticism of the film behind length), if you just stick with it and hang in there, you won't be disappointed if you are someone who appreciates endings that have a powerful 'moral of the story' as it's in the final five minutes that the biggest truth bomb drops, and when it does it's tragic, creating juxtaposing poignant images between a man who was once hailed a hero and praised by the flag-waving public and the devastation and destruction he has brought onto humanity. That ending alone paints the perfect description of the dichotomy between a man's ambitions and success inevitably leading to mass destruction."
"Once and for all.....Oppenheimer was NOT the father of the atomic bomb. The basic premise of chain reaction was Leo Szilard. Einstein did not write a letter to Roosevelt (he only signed it) Leo Szilard did. Fermi was only partly in charge under the bleachers. Leo Szilard saw his prediction completed there. Oppenheimer was a bureaucrat, a manager who was put in to co-ordinate a host of scientist, many of whom were Oppenheimer's better. And I wonder that not one person bothered to remember the first class BBC production made decades ago. If there is a father of this invention it was Szilard who in the end hated it."
"Christopher Nolan is the greatest single filmmaker of our time and here he shows exactly how well he has mastered his craft. The script for this film is immaculate. The cast is filled with A-list leading men and women, many of them in small parts with extremely limited screen time. The cinematography by Hoyt van Hoytema is breathtaking. The score by Ludwig Gorannson is stressful and beautiful at the same time. Cillian Murphy is a revelation as Oppenheimer, commanding the screen as the father of the atomic bomb. Robert Downey Jr. Gives the best performance of his career as Lewis Strauss. Emily Blunt is a standout as Kitty Oppenheimer, her own scenes often brilliant and powerful. The smaller roles in this cast are all great. Casey Affleck is incredibly unsettling when on screen, while Alden Ehrenreich is great. The standout performance of all of the smaller roles is Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock. This person, someone so important to the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, is often portrayed as this seemingly bi-polar, waifish, lost soul who drags Oppenheimer down. In this film, Pugh gives an incredibly nuanced performance, equal parts lustful and headstrong. Josh Hartnett is great, loved seeing him in a big film again. Rami Malik was great, really enjoyed him in this. Gary Oldman as Truman was an incredible portrayal; simultaneously the politician and the good old boy. This film should be the frontrunner for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Production Design, Best Sound Design, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Score, and Best Visual Effects (considering all of the SFX work was done practically!) Robert Downey Jr. Should win Best Supporting Actor, while Cillian Murphy should absolutely win Best Actor. One of the best historical epics I have ever seen 10/10!"
"Oppenheimer.Wow! Movie was truly an experience. The visuals with the black and white juxtaposed with color throughout and the sound effects were amazing. The use of sound is what really stood out.From the deafening sounds of blasts to the foreboding bass and other instrumentals throughout, the sound really set a great mood for the film.Cillian Murphy killed it with his performance, I think he was Oscar worthy. Robert Downey Jr., also was outstanding. Movie is very long but I felt the pacing worked well and the movie never dragged or got boring.Also loved how morality was highlighted and Oppenheimer's struggle with his own conscience in building the bomb.Best movie I've seen this year.8/10."
"Thousands of events have to conspire for a film to arrive on the screen. The craft takes a lifetime to master, the business is as tough and competitive as any in the world, hundreds of people have to meet, millions of ideas need to merge, and most films die before they're even born. So when we get a movie where such artists join at the pinnacle of their talents, in perfect timing, with the perfect story, and the perfect theme, when age and experience now allow them to give us a piece of work that is so far above and beyond the general output, craft-wise and thematically, then it deserves to be called ""something of a miracle"".A striking mastery has been delivered here by the team behind Oppenheimer. The standard of excellence is as high as it can be. The film absorbs and transports us, moves us, and terrifies us in a way only the best do, supplying the most emotional and exciting cinema experience. Nolan has become one of the most sophisticated and exciting dramatists that ever took to the big screen by extracting from such dense material many of the most suspenseful and engaging sequences put on screen. It is the most concentrated, virtuosic, and profound of his films.Most remarkable is that it manages to make an emotional epic out of minute gestures. Cillian Murphy's performance is perplexing. Every moment he creates, he encapsulates the depth and intensity of every thought pondered by its paradoxical protagonist. The real miracle of this film is that the perfect material finally met this actor to allow his potential to be revealed in its entirety. And part of what allows him to do so is the support of the most amazing ensemble of performances in recent memory; especially Robert Downey Jr's who finally shows us once and for all that he is among the most talented actors of his or any other generation.Melville wrote that ""to produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme"", but one thing is to dream of tackling such themes, another is to execute them at the visceral level that this team has. The subject matter here is so crucial that it forces us to face questions about our existence that mind-boggle even the greatest minds in the universe."
"Post The Dark Knight trilogy, Nolan has delivered consistency through diverse stories. Some of the films might have split opinions among some critics and audiences but there is no question on the making. Watching a Nolan movie in the cinemas is always an experience of a lifetime and he truly stands by his word of how these movies are meant to the big screen.Oppenheimer is a unique intense storytelling of an important part of world's history mainly through narration and a visual intensity to match with it. The trailer was very well edited and it barely gave anything about the movie. This movie probably may not have the same level of action sequences that most of the Nolan movies have but the adrenaline rush in this movie is served through intense moments between characters paired with classic background score. Ludwig Göransson excels again with the music in this after his collaboration with Nolan on Tenet. This movie probably has the most dialogue I have seen in a Nolan's film. It will take a while to understand where Nolan's going with the narration but the movie's climax makes it all worth it. The movie offers a great visual experience as it shifts through IMAX and normal ratio quite often. The practical efforts put in by the movie crew is clearly seen in the beautiful cinematography. Personally for me, this movie was not as entertaining as Nolan's movies of the past decade or so but it was definitely engaging.Oppenheimer boasts of a tremendous star cast and there is barely anything revealed in the trailer on the same. There are many brilliant actors playing very small but very important roles which I will not say much about. Over the years, Cillian Murphy has evolved into such a great actor and his performance doesn't really surprise the audience on how good it is. He devours the screen as Robert J Oppenheimer and the intensity in his eyes is a treat to watch. Robert Downey Jr's character as Lewis Strauss slowly builds up as the movie goes on and undergoes a unique transformation in the end. Florence Pugh's role left more impact on me than Emily Blunt's although the latter has the more screen time. Matt Damon offers a slightly refreshing shade to this intense film. This movie is indeed highly dependent on the actors and performances, Nolan brings the best and showcases the best as usual.Oppenheimer is yet another gripping tale by Nolan which makes you walk out of the cinema hall with some questions but a lot of retrospection."
"It is three hours long, but for a history buff like myself who knows his material, Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is absorbing from the start. Most impressive is the star-studded cast who bring the characters to life. Cillian Murphy is perfect in the titular role; Matt Damon is a believable General Groves; Robert Downey, Jr inhabits the part of Lewis Strauss; Tom Conti is transformed into a genial Albert Einstein. The only disappointment is Gary Old man, who had been so excellent as Winston Churchill but here plays Harry Truman like a caricature. Besides the cast, the editing is also amazing. The whole movie plays like a jigsaw puzzle, with different parts being assembled as each piece is put in place at different parts of the puzzle, until the whole picture is finally complete.Unfortunately, Oppenheimer the movie also left out important details for those too young to be aware of them. The problem with films like Oppenheimer is that they do history a disservice. The young people of today who watch Oppenheimer will go away with a warped view of the Second World War.The Second World War started with the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, which was preceded by the invasion of Manchuria in 1931. In Europe, the Nazi invasion of Poland only took place in 1939, after the Chamberlain appeasement.Among the many atrocities that were committed by the Japanese Army in China was the mass rape and massacre of innocent Chinese civilians in Nanking (numbering around 200,000), documented as the Rape of Nanking, in 1937-38.After destroying the US Naval Base in Pearl Harbor in 1941, the Japanese proceeded to conquer territories in Southeast Asia. Many people in Penang and Singapore, homes of my parents, were tortured and killed. For nearly 10 years, Japanese soldiers were responsible for the Asian Holocaust which involved them raping, torturing and murdering their fellow Asian civilians.After the War ended in Europe with the defeat of the Nazis, the USA and its Allies gave the Japanese government an ultimatum: unconditional surrender or meet the atom bomb. The Japanese refused to surrender, so the atom bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. If you thought that was enough to frighten the Japanese, well -- it didn't. Again, the Japanese government was told to surrender unconditionally or face a second atomic bomb. Obvious choice, right? Hell, no. More like, bring it on. Do they care about their people? So the second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. Ultimately, fearing a third, the Japanese surrendered unconditionally and World War Two came to an end.In the movie, Oppenheimer felt guilty being responsible for the bomb. But it was the Japanese wartime government that allowed their own people to be killed by refusing to surrender when given the option. The movie also gave a warped portrayal of President Harry Truman, with Gary Oldman's acting coming across as caricaturish, which is jarring when compared to the rest of the cast. Truman understood the might of the atom bomb and its implications. During the Korean conflict, war hero General Douglas MacArthur wanted to drop an atomic bomb on communist China for its support of North Korea. Truman put his foot down and sacked MacArthur for insubordination. It was an unpopular move he took to fire a war hero, but if MacArthur had his way, the dropping of atomic bombs would not have stopped at two till this day. We need to thank Truman for his level-headedness and for acknowledging the implications of nuclear warfare.And what if the Nazis or Soviets had been the first to develop an atomic bomb? I shudder to even think of such a scenario."
"Oppenheimer = 10/10Positive:-The entire cast is amazing and every actor gives an amazing performance-Cillian Murphy gives one of his best performances and portrays the character of Oppenheimer perfectly.-The film impressively creates a touching character study of the Oppenheimer and captivatingly portrays his inner conflict.-In general, the screenplay is awesome and manages to present seemingly boring court cases and mathematical processes in an incredibly exciting way.The dialogues are also brilliant and make every scene a masterpiece.-The film also travels with you on a staging level and captivates with great recordings and sound design and especially the atomic bomb scene makes you wince in the cinema chair.Negative:/Conclusion: The film captivates from second to second and, with the help of a grandiose cast, profound story and masterful staging and above all a great Cillian Murphy, it creates a modern masterpiece that will still be talked about in years to come."
"Another banger from the master of practical effect with his usual style of filmmaking that gives a massive middle finger to modern hollywood. Drama all the way to the end, yet the maestro manage to make it far from boring with the intensity and the energy not even today's action movies can compete, not even the fast and the furious latest film can make you sit down watching a three-hour movie makes you not sleepy as if watching a movie with only half the duration. If you think the atomic bomb here is scary, try to see the political intrigue that proceeds AND follows it, the very cost of being the modern version of Prometheus.8.5/10."
"Everything Nolan said about this movie almost does not match its truth, talking about IMAX technology, and the scene of the explosion that the audience will shudder at as if it were real, and about the scenes included in the trailer, all of which gives a very different impression of the movie ..! The huge publicity of the film made the audience (including myself) raise their expectations, and even get ready to watch a movie different from the one they saw in the movie theatre .. Yes, the movie is good, the performance of all the actors is excellent, Robert Downey Jr. And Cillian Murphy did amazing performance .. But this is not what they sold us in the trailer and the advertisements of the movie that almost tell about another movie completely .."
"This is my honest review, Just finished watching and nothing is good or great except Murphys acting. Just hype nothing else, Dont even compare to Barbie, which i believe was victim in this season.I have watched all of Nolans movies and definately expectation was more after his last one Tenet, but this is nothing close to any of his movies, Just effects and Hype cannot take any movie on longer race but looks like there is global support on this & every where people are praising this as one of the best.Also the recent note on Bagvad gita & protest is another way to advertisement for this movie and that kind of gimmics worked for other few movies,
Final suggestion don't go with too much of expectation just watch & forget."
"Another magnum opus from Christopher Nolan.A thrilling character study of one of history's most complex historical figures whose contribution to the world was viewed as a bit underrated, but not any more thanks to this movie. Nolan crafts a phenomenal, chilling, & terrifying exploration of scientific discovery, persecution during the McCarthy paranoia, and moral dilemma. Cillian Murphy knocks it out of the park in the most captivating and heartbreaking performances of his career. I will eat my foot if Murphy doesn't get an Oscar nomination. While the cast is filled with many actors, no matter how small their appearance is, they all bring their A-game. But the ones who made a large impression are Robert Downey Jr in a menacing performance (Oscar-worthy), Florence Pugh's small and tragic part, Benny Safdie's turn as a Hungarian scientist, and Tom Conti as the adorable Albert Einstein. I can understand that there will be criticisms towards the female characters in the movie, Nolan does put a lot of effort and sympathy towards them, and you can't change history for how they were treated or how they ended up.The cinematography is spectacular, especially in the black and white scenes, and the visuals were truly mind-bending, with the highlight being the Trinity test sequence; you can actually feel that there wasn't any CGI on screen. The tension is built perfectly with incredible sound design & another magnificent score from Ludwig Göransson.The final scene, and especially the final lines are going to stick with me forever and with everyone else.See it on IMAX!!!!!!!!"
"This movie is amazing, like really amazing and a masterpiece and not a disappointment from christopher Nolan. Howerver the movie is not for everyone, its sophisticated and not all people will grasp it from the beginning. It's twisting and you have to concentrate with everything begind said, every name and every character in the movie because this movie is like a puzzle and you put the pieces together to get the full picture. 3 hours long and really slow rhythm and that's it's only draw back. Sone dialogues were boring in parts of the movie but once you finish the movie you will realise that these boring parts were needed but towards the end the rhythm is accelerated and that was necessary. People who like the spoon like info and pop corn movies would definitely say that this was a bad movie and would give it a 1-3/10 but that would be a disgrace for the movie. And RDJ was giving the performance of his life. It is an oscar performance and he is going to be a strong nominee. Overall this movie can only be watched in the cinema because at home, you will never get the magic of it. The black and white scenes were my favourite in this movie."
"This film was my most anticipated film of the Summer, if not the year; and the film certainly did not disappoint! Christopher Nolan delivers the best movie of his career, without a doubt! It's a cinematic masterpiece, and I will be surprised if this movie DOESN'T win the Oscar for Best Picture of the year. It deserves that title. It's certainly is the best film I've seen this year, and takes the top spot on my list!The film delivers a stunning, staggering, and sometimes scary look at the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the ""father of the atomic bomb."" The movie is based on the biography of Oppenheimer called 'American Prometheus' by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin (which I read in a week last month to prepare for the film). Oppenheimer is portrayed by Cillian Murphy, whose performance is so riveting and nuanced and haunting that the 3 hour runtime of the film became an afterthought. His performance as the famous theoretical physicist who birthed the world's first nuclear weapons is haunting, so nuanced, and brilliant that I couldn't take my eyes off him the entire time he was on the screen! Murphy ought to make room on his shelf for the many awards that should be coming his way due to this incredible performance!The other standout performances amongst this massive ensemble star filled cast is Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss, a former political ally turned bitter rival of Oppenheimer. Downey commands the screen in a performance that allows him to stretch his legs and really gives him the respect he deserves as one of the best in the business, and he should receive a Best Supporting Actor nomination or award for his performance. Other superb performances in this are the the ladies in Oppenheimer's life, played by Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh!The movie starts with the hammer down and doesn't let up, and will keep you on the edge of your seat till the very very last haunting shot, in which Oppenheimer contemplates the potential future world ending way his creation may be used to bring an end to human civilization.The film, though 3 hours long (believe me, it doesn't feel like a 3 hour long film) is a masterpiece, and it could almost be broken down into 3 acts: Oppenheimer's origin story (where he almost sees things on a molecular level with molecules and atoms smashing and moving together, almost like a superhero), the second act begins with the start of the Manhattan Project, which begins an edge of your seat portion of the movie, depicting the scientist's race to beat the Nazis in the development of the atomic bomb (a race at the time during WWII Germany had an 18 month head start on the development of atomic weapons; act 3 begins after the successful Trinity Test (which is done with absolutely no CGI whatsoever). The 3rd act of the movie becomes a very tense and gripping courtroom drama as well as a bit of a psychological horror piece, as Oppenheimer and a few of the fellow scientists begin to contemplate the massive horror they've unleashed on the world. Christopher Nolan blends the 3 acts in the movie together in such a masterful way that those 3 hours go by pretty quickly.The subject matter is of course pretty dark, but you can't take your eyes off of the spectacle and the epic story of a man whose innovation allowed us to save human civilization, but also haunted him for the rest of his life, and the phenomenal performances by all of the actors involved.Some people may need a refresher on WWII and Cold War history before watching this film, but any cinephile and movie lover like myself should be more than happy to lose themselves in this film.Chris Nolan masterfully weaves narratives from different time periods while exploring the character depths of a man whose actions altered the world's history and trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us right into the mind and the complex psyche of Oppenheimer himself, and all the moral conflicts within him.Every single thing in the movie is flawless, including the score and music by Ludwig Göransson. It truly deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible. It's an unforgettable movie and my favorite film of the year! It's the best movie of 2023. Period!"
"As far as 2023 goes, and possibly my entire life I think I can safely say that this has been the greatest film I have ever had the pleasure of watching on the big screen.As far as narrative is concerned Nolan delivers a masterpiece of a story, gripping from the start to the to the exquisite ending allowing for a comprehensive telling of one of history's defining moments of the 20th century.As for it being the arguably the best in cinema experience I have ever been able to see, it was a stunning both audibly and visually triumph and can only credit to Nolan and his team for delivering something that can and will be remembered as one of the greatest looking films of this generation and probably for years to come.Nolan has seamlessly picked a cast for this picture that were able to deliver what i would call there best performances yet, both RDJ and Cillian Murphy were at their absolute best, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon are also able to deliver these exertional performances. A casting so well chosen and a break away from some of the usual suspects of Nolan's films is a joy to behold really.As for a recommendation I could not stress this enough that you must see this film. An expectational piece of work and one I believe will stand for a very long time, perhaps at the top for historical dramas and maybe even the crowing moment of Nolan's career so far."
"There are numerous occasions where Hollywood has gifted the world the stories that celebrate the human emotion, invention , the lives they lived and historical events which created an impact on human history as we know it but only a few of them have been able to create an impact on the viewer's mind like this. The opening scene of the movie which features a haunting background theme and Oppenheimer facing a bureaucratic enquiry on him against his appeal to revoke his security clearance in Atomic Energy Comission but rejected because of his affiliation with communist community. Seemingly lost in his thoughts , Noland took a dive to Oppenheimer's early days where he could be seen working as a researcher in Cavendish Laboratory under Cambridge University in England. Interacting with Neils Bohr , who suggested him continuing his theoretical research on Quantum Physics which wasn't much popular in the USA back then , he returned to his homeland where he worked with Ernest Lawrence who invented the ""Cyclotron"" after completing his PhD in physics in Cambridge, until he was approached by General Leslie Groves to get involved in Project Manhattan to develope the first neuclear bomb. Assuring Groves about his zero sympathy towards communism , Oppenheimer takes charge of the project and gathers all of the industrial might available in the USA to develop the first atom bomb before Nazi Germany could make one. The movie then proceeds with further Historical events towards the event where they successfully conducted the ""The Trinity Test"" . After the Hiroshima and Nagasaki event Oppenheimer finds himself guilty for the reason of the death of the countless people and starts to advocate the adverse effects of neuclear bombs in human civilization which was not received well by Lewis Strauss, a chairperson in Atomic energy commission who ploys his plan to strip Oppenheimer of his political influence.Ths is the history as we know it. But the benchmark screenplay from which uses a non linear story telling which is a very classic signature style of Nolan gets the audience hooked to the screen from the very fast moment combined with the absolute brilliant musical score that turns the biopic into a historical thriller that will stay as a prime example of brilliance. The cinematography and the editing work of Jenifer Lame will never let you move your eyes from the screen away. The nudity used onscreen could feel a little excessive and unnecessary at the beginning but as the story proceeds , we could see the relevance of it in the movie. When Oppneheimer was being stripped and judged because of his scandalous affairs more than the contribution he made , we can see the scandal sensanization of social structures that makes people vulnerable at their weakest without trying to whitewash the characteristical traits of him, rather Nolan leaves it to the audience. He doesn't judge his characters, he just told the story as it happened. One particular aspect of the movie is using black n white and colour for two main characters, Oppenheimer and Lewis Strauss. Differentiation of the two characters and their mindset by using this technique without commenting on them is the cinematic brilliance of Nolan of giving the audience que to how to receive them.Cillian Murphy became Openheimer totally. The usual mannerisms of Cillain Murphy was totally missing and when you will think that he stole the show , RDJ just set the fire on screen with his unrecognisable appearance and intense acting prowess. All the other cast did a fabulous job in their respective roles thanks to the brilliant casting.As usual every Nolan movie is incomplete without a little indecisive ending that leaves so many questions for audience. He asks the question to the audience because this Manhattan project had created a series of events , but was Openheimer ever able to forgive himself for being the god of death ?In a short conclusion , ""Oppenheimer"" is a masterpiece in every aspect , the technical aspects such as lighting , set design , sound design, costume design , colour and grading of this movie are too high standard that will always inspire other film makers forever.P. S. Thai movie is a must watch in Imax screens , especially for the Trinity test sequence. The tension building of that scene just can't be described in words."
"This movie was fantastic. Nolan confirms that there was no CGI usage. All effects were practical, including the bomb exploding. Friggin unreal LOL. The shots of the explosion's test was incredible. I am personally unsure on who is responsible, the cinematographer, editor, photographer, director, or all of them. Either way, they all should get so many awards.The acting was crazy insane. Cillian Murphy should get so many awards for this. Just with some mild changes to his eyes, he can go from sad, to angry, to confident, to happy, to guilt. The ""Big Stars"" like Damon, Blunt, Robert Downy Jr, all could've phoned it in and simply ride on the coattails of Cillian Murphy, but they all brought it.The only complaint, and reason for me giving this a 9/10 instead of a 10/10, is the oddly long sex scene. I am not a prude at all, but showing the sex scene, let alone the nudity all together was just very out of place. I understand letting the audience know when the character is distracted or seduced (in this case literally LOL), but as I mentioned, Cillian Murphy can portray being burdened by himself. But again, this is a personal thing, and a nitpick.But man this movie was great, props to everyone who was a part of it."
"A must watch movie for sure. It was a gripping story showing facets of history unknown to most of us. Screenplay, acting, background, capturing the vivid explosion moments- every aspect of the direction speaks of genius of Nolan! Overall stellar movie! C Murphy probably played the ""Best"" role of his entire career. Also, Robert D, Jr. , Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Tony Conti, Josh H, what awesome character plays!However, would like to mention the ""Hindu Phobia"" depicted in the movie. Being tolerant civilization, Hindus let everything slide but if it were some ""other"" religion, well certainly we have seen What happened in France.It's sad to see that Oppenheimer's dedication to ""Bhagwat Gita"" was trivialized to such low standards! It was really disturbing moment! Most importantly, artistic liberty aside it feels factually incorrect for someone who read the Gita to indulge!Hence, the call out to Nolan feels necessary to keep the review fair!"
"The long anticipated Oppenheimer finally arrived and despite the fact that I was expecting this to be some of the greatest cinematic feats ever I was still amazed at how much better that was than I expected it to be.The story is expertly crafted and structured. It utilizes non-linear story telling to delay clarifying charaters motivations and thus adding rewatchability to the movie. The movie is 3 hours long but that doesn't mean it is bloated. Quite the opposite actually as it keeps you at the edge of your seat for the whole runtime and there is not one scene that appears to be out of place.The combination of beautiful,expressive cinematography(credit goes to Hoyten van Hoytema) and color grading paired with the bonechilling score from Ludwig Goransson really complements the immersion of the movie.There are tons of stars in the cast and not a single one misses a beat. I will not even attempt to name all of them so I will say a word aboit the ones that left me with the strongest impression. Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh execute their roles in spectacular fashion. Matt Damon really put his all into the role and you can tell. RDJ is now officialy free of the Tony Stark public image in what is probably his best role ever. Hopefully he gets an Oscar for supporting role because he really does deserve it. I'm going to briefly mention Kenneth Branagh and Rami Malek who also deliver outstanding albeit small roles. There are also many more but I don't want to spend the whole review listing names.But the REAL standout was Cillian Murphy in the lead role. He potrayed such a complex and multilayered character to absolute perfection. One can really only watch and wonder how such a mastery of the craft is even possible.This is one of Nolan's best, probably since Inception. It is undeniably on of the greatest movies that I have had the pleasure to see. Truly a display of brilliancy and nothing short of genius.Absolute perfection 10/10."
"I found the pace of the film was almost like a chain reaction and perhaps that is the intention of the Director. Some brilliant actors, or movie stars, taking relatively small parts. Fitting as the film the science is about stars in the universe. Tom Conti as Einstein was very convincing. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer surely must be nominated for a major award.. Murphy looks just like the Scientist and appears in many scenes of the 3 hour film. The 3 hours passes very quickly as the script doesn't allow one to be distracted or one would literally lose the plot. I got the Science bit but must admit to coming home and googling what was going on politically and who the main players were."
"If this was not a Christopher Nolan movie, it would not even be noticed. It's hard to understand also why this movie would need to be seen in an IMAX theatre. It is probably mainly down to the subject matter, but I felt it was boring, predictable, and the void of any of the intricate storytelling and uniqueness that I have come to like about Nolan movies. One gets the impression that this movie is getting the attention it does because of the history of its maker, but not on the merit of its own performance. The hype is definitely over done on this one. There was some decent acting, especially from Downey Jr. And Damon."
"While this film is enjoyable, it might not be one that viewers come out loving. The majority of the entertainment value of this film is in the beginning leading to the creation of the atomic bomb. Once the bomb is created and tested the rest of the film becomes a bit underwhelming. The aftermath of the attacks on Japan were shared through dialogue and a bit of quirky visuals but nothing truly showing how those people were affected by the bomb. It would have been emotionally gripping to have those visuals or even real news reports from when the attacks took place.The events of the film do not follow a linear path and the use of greyscale and color help to distinguish those events. The use of sound in this film was also utilized very well to create tension and to set the mood. The acting by the entire cast was top notch which was elevated by the strong dialogue.However, the role played by Florence Pugh was unnecessary and served more as a distraction to the overall film. The story could have been told without it which would have decreased the runtime that dragged at times.Rami Malek's character was underdeveloped and it only becomes more apparent when his importance is revealed and one is left wondering why he only had two silly scenes.Other small roles such as the one played by Casey Affleck's provided just enough context to understand his role and significance in the story.Robert Downey Jr. Does a great job at his role but the motives for his character seem silly. While these motives might have been true to the real-life person it just took away from the character and weakened the story. Cillian Murphy delivers a well-acted performance but his character's personality is bland. Thus, making the film less interesting.In the end, this well-made film lacks rewatchability. It tells the story it wants to tell but it doesn't make it compelling enough. A well-made film doesn't make for a great story."
"Oppenheimer's key contribution to chemistry, physics, material science, engineering, and allied sciences was that he led an international team to build a weapon of mass destruction. Suspicions about his political views and loyalty to the conditions of his security clearance are, to me, secondary to his accomplishment leading such a disparate group of scientists to completion of the task, however morally repugnant the product and horrible its result.There should be a way of directing a film or mini-series that does a serious job of getting inside what that leadership looked and felt like without cutting corners on the science. The characters shouldn't resort to dramatic outbursts unless they're supported by fact and the science shouldn't be dumbed down or explained in ways that would not have happened among the most sophisticated scientists in their fields at that time.Is Oppenheimer an interesting film? Is it well made? Sure, but I'm left wanting so much more than a story about how he was dismantled by politicians."
"Though (brilliantly) closely observed, the movie is riveting. Even though you know the events that are going to happen--Oppenheimer and colleagues develop the bomb, the bomb is tested and then unleashed on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Oppenheimer has regrets, he is subjected to one hearing, and his antagonist is subjected to another--you don't know how it's going to happen. You don't know the mindset of the people involved or the steps that lead inevitably and inexorably to the world as we know it now: deeply conflicted, riddled with pockets of willful blindness, and horribly polarized.The movie puts you in the shoes of one of the most tortured and consequential human beings ever to grace the planet, whose thoughts, life, and dealings were far more nuanced than many of us have understood. How can Oppenheimer, a man of community-minded and pacific sensibilities, justify his willingness and even eagerness to build the bomb? The idea that the Germans might build one first goes only so far. And then the time comes when Germany has been defeated and the question remains only of how to bring Japan, which has only conventional weapons, to heel. The movie shows Oppenheimer give a rationale for detonating the bomb on the country that seems naive--granted that the appearance is retrospective. How much did he really believe it? The movie forces us to ponder the question and yet not resolve it, because perhaps Oppenheimer didn't.Cillian Murphy plays the tortured, reserved and yet passionate and fierce, Oppenheimer hauntingly and exquisitely. The many other characters are both written and played with intricate shading as well. You are in those rooms with them. The use of the hearings as the movie's scaffolding and the interleaving of them with the events they concern is sheer art."
"My first viewing of this was at a very late night showing at my local IMAX theater and as much as I really enjoyed it, I wish I would have seen it earlier in the day because I felt like I missed certain details while I was already feeling tired. I decided to see it a 2nd time at a different theater not in IMAX and honestly I found the 2nd viewing to be more enjoyable and the film felt like it went faster this time as my mind was more awake and engaged and everything clicked for me. Nonetheless, this is one of the most important films ever made and I really hope it continues to get the praise it deserves."
"To be honest, even though I regard Christopher Nolan as one of my favourite, if not favourite film directors, when I first heard that Oppenheimer was his next film, I was a bit skeptical. Oppenheimer is a drama/biography is a genre Nolan has not tackled before. So I was not sure how this one would come out, and was cautious to jump on the hype of the Barbenheimer craze.BUTAfter watching the film, I realise my doubt was misplaced and I have grown significantly more respect and appreciation for Nolan's work.Oppenheimer was an amazing film!Despite it being nearly three hours long, I was really impressed how they managed to give the film a fast pace. The film never really felt like it slowed down. The intensity was constant throughout. In a weird way, it felt like the ticking of a time bomb, always progressing to something bigger.Ludwig Göransson's soundtrack was impeccable. It just complemented the film so well and played a major role in maintaining the films quick pace. I don't think I could name a another film where the soundtrack was so integral to the film.All the actors and actresses gave outstanding performances! Cillian Murphy! My goodness! Oscar Worthy performance from him. I enjoyed the way the film kept me enraptured in his Oppenheimer's psyche. He brought such an emotional intensity to each scene, purely through his facial expressions and body language. I truly empathized with his moments of conflict where he gets caught in the thick of war and politics and how he is forced to grapple with the consequences of his actions.I was also throughly impressed with Robert Down Jr's performance as Lewis Strauss. He made it seem so easy. I believe he could be a contender for Best Supporting Actor.Credit must go to Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh, who did not have as big roles as Murphy, but did really well when they were on screen.I love that Nolan always opts for shooting using IMAX cameras because it gives his film a unique visual style. The shots didn't have insane composition but I enjoyed their shooting style. They made use of many closeups which kept me engaged and allowed me to sympathise with Oppenheimer more. The closeups ups also kept you absorbed in the tension and did not allow you to escape. I continue to enjoy Hoyte van Hoytema colour palette as well with the combination of greys, blue, black etc.This film is also a triumph in filmmaking because Nolan showed that even though there is no action but mostly dialogue, there are still ways you can use the film language to make a film engaging. On top of that, he still manages to share his unique artistic flair because even though Oppenheimer is a biography, it still felt like a ""Christopher Nolan Movie"" with it's sprinkles of espionage, special effects, surreal imagery etc.Oppenheimer manages to live up and surpass the hype in many ways and could honestly go down as one of the most riveting dramas/biographies ever made!"
"What is the creation of an atomic bomb other than harnessing life itself, hijacking the power of atoms and corrupting them to destroy themselves? Is this not the ultimate act of man becoming God, claiming ultimate dominion of the world that created him, possibly making man a patricidal creature?Perhaps physicists are the preachers of life and genius their gospel, their invention of the bomb their eschatology and the consummation of the peak man has sought to scale.Here we follow Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, from his early days as a brilliant and young intellectual to a man who creates perhaps the most consequential invention since fire - the next Prometheus - to the archetypal trope of the scientist haunted by his own invention. Genius is no guarantee of wisdom, as one character says in the film and just because we can do something doesn't mean we should.And he lives to regret it. A bright-eyed man becomes jaded and maligned by the world and zeitgeist he helped create. Just as Prometheus was tortured, so too will Oppenheimer suffer for his invention.An incredible biopic that sears into your mind. I was worn out from the viewing experience last night but have been pondering it with more clarity this morning. SEE IT. A rare, generational excursion into the Faustian and Promethian nature of humanity and creation."
"Just watched Oppenheimer.Prediction for Best Movie 2023It's amazing!The acting by Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr and just everyone is just outstanding, excellent.Predicting Cillian Murphy will win best actor 2023.The sound by Ludwig Goransson js amazing! The suspense and the drama and the tension is built so nicely. Prediciting best sound 2023.Christopher Nolan is amazing! With the transition and screenplay and cut scenes and his use of music and just everything about this movie is amazing!The story by itself is good, not great. Its a biopic, but he doesn't make it look like it. He with his non linear story lines and transitions makes the story so beautiful.Must watch movie."
"Saw OPPENHEIMER on Saturday in its 70mm large format screening. Really a phenomenal piece of filmmaking by writer and director Christopher Nolan, the story centered around the Father of the Atomic Bomb and leader of The Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, J. Robert Oppenheimer, played to perfection by actor Cillian Murphy. Worth noting, as well is the extraordinary performance by actor Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss. It wouldn't surprise me if both actors receive Oscar nominations for their character portrayals, they are that good! Also great in supporting roles, Emily Blunt (Kitty Oppenheimer), Matt Damon (General Leslie Groves), Jason Clarke (Roger Robb) and an appearance by Gary Oldman as President Truman. Returning as Nolan's DOP is Hoyte van Hoytema (Interstellar, Dunkirk, Tenet) whose cinematography in Oppenheimer is breathtaking. Love the new black and white photography created especially for the film, it is sharp, clean and crisp. Just like in Nolan's 2000 film, Memento, the black and white is juxtaposed with color, perfectly utilized for past and present scenes and as a way to interpret the lead character's moral struggles and ambiguity. I had no problem with the 3 hour runtime, dialogue was intelligent and the film moves at a good pace thanks to streamlined editing by Jennifer Lame (Tenet) and a strong, haunting score by Ludwig Göransson (Tenet). Oppenheimer is quite the triumph for Chris Nolan."
"My eye did not move away from the screen for a single moment, throughout the 3 hour film, not a single moment. The most immersive experience I've ever had. Literally. It will take you back to the times. Christopher Nolan really managed to visually narrate all the main events of Oppenheimer's life in the most excellent way possible. Think about that, decades of material put into 3 hours. That type of story demands a steady concentration by the audience.While we're talking about thinking, I remembered the ending of this movie. Man. That ending will haunt me and the music throughout not only that scene but also the sound design and editing at the same time are just literal milestones of leveling up a scene. Through the whole movie. It is just perfect.Yes. The ending is perfect. The beginning is engaging to say the least. And the introduction to quantum physics at the beginning is done so divine-ly (makes more sense cause it's from Oppenheimer's POV anyways) and the music played ""Can you hear the music"" just made me fall in love.TLDR for y'all mfs; TRUE CINEMA IS BEING PLAYED ON THE BIGGEST SCREENS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. The correct way you can pay respect is watching it on the biggest screen in your city, you'll be forever grateful for paying that respect which I guarantee, after watching it 3 times."
"We agree that this is one of the greatest films that we will mention in the coming years, integrated in all respects
First, directing: Nolan presented us with wonderful scenes using an IMAX camera
Secondly, the acting: Cillian Murphy was fabulous in this movie. I really felt that Oppenheimer's character was made for him. He was acting with his eyes. His looks at the camera were alone enough to know what he feel. The Oscar will be for Best Actor
As for Robert Downey, you will really forget that he played the character of Iron Man. It was a masterpiece for me. This is the best performance in his career. Also, he deserves the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.Thirdly, music and sound: If you are not interested in sound or music, then this movie is completely different. It was the best experience anyone could go through in any movie, and for me it was the best thing in the movie.Fourth, the scenario: to say the least, it was complex and woven in a wonderful way. We were moving from untidy timelines, going back to the past, then going to the present, and also going to the future. Some scenes were in colors that indicate something and were narrated from a person's perspective, while others were in black and white. And it indicates something else and the way he wrote Oppenheimer's character and analyzed his feelings and feelings of happiness, sadness or tension. I think that the film was able to present a biographical film in an unconventional way.The defect in this movie are two things. The first is the speed of the events in the first hour of the movie, as it was moving between times quickly, making this viewer in a state of incomprehensibility with the large number of characters. This may make some viewers upset, but it was not an important thing if you focused on the movie. The other defect, and I think it is not important, is the lack of focus on Oppenheimer's emotions towards his relationship with his ex-girlfriend and his wife. He did not give us enough time to get to know his character or even get attached to the character, but this is not important because the movie is not romantic.This is a first-class dialogue movie. If you are willing to watch a three-hour movie full of wonderful events, politics, feelings, tension, fear and anxiety, then this movie is for you. Advice before you watch the movie, try to know some information about the life of the scientist Oppenhaper and about the events Which was going on in the war so that you are sufficiently aware of what is happening in the film and focus on the film well. This is not written by any ordinary director. This is written by the genius Christopher Nolan."
"The story begins by introducing us to the main character, which I liked. It then excites us about a historic project: how it shaped. But soon viewer may notice things are happening fast & quick; Germany surrounded, atom is splittd...""What is happening"" a veiwer might ask? ""The movie is 3 hrs long, why is there so much hurry!"" They almost fast forward to tell you how USA gov screwed Oppenheimer. 3 hour movie and one of the biggest crime of humanity is made about a womenizer, narcissist and psycho who thought of a bomb 3 sec after he heard atom's been splitted.Furthermore, Nolan's movies are known to have different timelines, a movie like memento or inception needed that style to serve the story's depth and dimensions, but this one was an biography there was no need for such style, unless Nolan used it just as a signature. Also, such movies that are about the least important matter in an event where 200k people died, can only be a documentary, not a Nolan movie, I am so disappointed. Not the best use of resources.Lastly, come on, abondan the idea of a 3-hour movie already! Movies should never go over 100 minutes...or a rest interval in theatre should become mandatory."
"One of the best directors and an assemble of Hollywood talent, just to make an emotionless documentary.I can count on one hand the vaguely entertaining moments of this movie.There isn't anything that happens in the first 50 minutes, not even an interesting conversation, including the fictional ones with Einstein.I have an interest in Nuclear Physics and how the war was ended, which mean't I learned absolutely nothing from this movie.There is the side tale of the McCarthy communist witch hunts, but that's all been done before and much better.Cillan Murphy went from Peaky Blinder excellence to play a dead pan scientist. Why?Once the Nolan fan boys have stopped leaving reviews, this movie will drop like a brick, to a more realistic score.It's so poor, I wish I'd watched Barbie. Best thing in Oppenheimer is the poster. End your interest there and you'll be a happier person."
"Focused on the story of Robert Oppenheimer, his struggles and passion for theoretical physics, Christopher Nolan does an excellent job with his ability to portray the possible struggles and barriers a man of his intellect have to overcome.Other than the need to get used to the non-linear method of storytelling Nolan adapts, and the fast cuts between scenes I see no other issues with Oppenheimer.It is clear as day that this movie was not intended for an audience that wants a fun entertainer, rather was intended to an audience that is willing to revisit our history, and learn more about a man that was tasked with a job very few in history have been tasked with.If expectation are set accordingly, this movie can be rather inspiring."
"I'm not sure if I'm educated enough to review this film. That's how historically accurate it was, that's how successful Nolan was in terms of helping the audience visualize a 3-hour long biopic about one of the most important figures in the history of mankind.Murphy was fantastic. So was RDJ, Blunt and the rest of the cast. The script was well-written, and I felt Nolan intentionally made the audience jump back and forth between events occurring in different points of the timeline so that the audience have to connect the dots for themselves. This is, in my opinion, what made the biopic even more epic as you'd have to be attentive and figure out what's been happening by yourself. The thoughts it can provoke inside you - specially as part of the future generation - is remarkable. This is pure storytelling, in its most raw and accurate form.However, if you're only expecting to see irrelevant nuclear detonations and blasts throughout the entire runtime, you probably should reconsider. What history says, Nolan shows. Nothing more, nothing less."
"Audience in theatres in Japan cried uninterrupted while in America laughed at will yesterday while watching a 3hr 15minutes history. Two feelings amidst one earth and humanity! The sufferer and the attacker!Others shocked and confused for years of hard work get into research and manufacturing a BOMB and USA disowning it's scientists in a cruel way of credits which must shock current generation!Watched Oppenheimer without IMAX at Wave Noida, in the Uttarptadesh State of India, Earth. I think it's the biggest cinema hall in National Capital Territory of India!Oppenheimer is about more than just the man, a haunted, hard-to-know figure played with impressive backbone and clarity by Cillian Murphy in a career-defining performance. It's about confluence of events that led him,who one gets the impression would have been much happier doing obscure theoretical research for rest of his life,to a point in time where his abstract ideas about structure of reality and energy changed course of human history. Movie is also about how humanity itself deals with the questions that terrible discoveries raise, and what we do with the kind of power that was unleashed by the man and his vast team of scientists at the Los Alamos lab in New Mexico. The answers are depressing and shocking.It takes Nolan a full Three hours to get to those answers, but for a while it's not clear whether he'll get there. Oppenheimer throws so much incident and so many characters at you, particularly in its first hour or so, that it's almost bewilderingly obscure for a good chunk of its first act. It's flatly almost impossible to keep track of who's who of historical figures here, including hydrogen bomb creator Edward Teller, Nobel Prize winner Ernest Lawrence, quantum theorist Niels Bohr and physicist Richard Feynman among many others.We also meet the two major women in Oppenheimer's life: psychiatrist and Communist activist, Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), and Oppenheimer's eventual wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), neither of whom do much, although Blunt gets a rousing scene in support of her man near the film's end.Nolan's masterful skills at cross cutting, building of tension,interplay of music&sound,maximum use of IMAX 70mm compositions he and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema deploy all come to fore during this central portion of film, creating a genuine sense of dread and urgency. Nolan's conception of actual, successful detonation of Trinity bomb in New Mexico desert is almost understated in both its terrible beauty&fearsome power, we only get indirect hints at the unspeakable aftermath of dropping of the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki through Oppenheimer's eyes!What we do get in the final act of the movie is not just clear indication that we as a species are simply not equipped to handle the most powerful force yet discovered in nature but the destruction of the man who speaks out most fervently against its continued use.Oppenheimer himself, so frightened by his own creation, so rattled by its nightmarish potential, that he begins seeing horrific visions even as he uses his now high public profile to speak out passionately for a global ban on nuclear weapons.This Film is magnificent production, score by Ludwig Göransson is majestic& and intimate its almost feeling like a Greek chorus with each scene is spectacular. Nolan's cast also deserves kudos. Pugh and Blunt bravely work with what they've got, wringing empathy out of underwritten female characters, while Damon is reliable as always, others like Hartnett make most out of characters we don't get a lot of time to know.Amazing Nolan can use 70mm film format for mostly medium shots or close-ups of people talking&yet still make it seem epic.Murphy presents Oppenheimer himself as a genius who lives inside his own head much of time,commanding leader. A man deeply wounded by hurt of others, yet also remote&businesslike,a man who loves his country yet is willing to risk his own reputation for greater good of humanity.Last but not least Robert Downey Jr. Should walk away with an Oscar for his work as Lewis Strauss. Made up to look older&discarding nearly all tics that we've come to know from a decade of playing Tony Stark, Downey shows us why, although he was never less than great as Iron Man.Whether the generation that grew up with Downey as the leader of the MCU will go see this difficult, dense, and challenging movie,a film that's polar opposite of a ""summer tentpole"" is another question entirely."
"Oppenheimer was a surprising, pulse-pounding, twisting picture of both the human condition and the condition of all of humanity as we know it. The runtime and pacing of each scene has been constructed carefully, with great attention to detail.Oppenheimer uses its audio cues to great emotional effect, like rhythmic stomping and split-second explosions cut in at the right times. However, as with many recent Nolan films, it does suffer from poor dialogue volume and dialogue capture. Although not as bad as 2020's Tenet (in that movie every time traveler wears a gas mask that muffles them), I still found myself struggling to piece together sentences in the middle of a crowd or wide echoing room. I did eventually grow to understand these parts better as the movie continued, but I wish I didn't have to.Christopher Nolan's adaptation of Oppenheimer's struggle with human morality, political scrutiny, and personal decisions effectively throw the audience into his shoes and force them to see what he has seen. I was thrilled by its entirely practical visuals. Dream sequences and cutaways are never gratuitous and always manage to paint the emotions of its characters with a strong contrast to their more subtle expressions.FOOTNOTE: The movie works surprisingly well juxtapositioned after a showing of Barbie. Both films explored what it means to be human in both a micro and macro sense. Barbenheimer does work."
"Christopher Nolan does it again, he keeps you focused for 3 hours on the screen wanting to see even more, using a precise script, impeccable photography and a performance by Cillian Murphy that transports you to the very mind of the Head of the Manhattan project, his genius and his romantic and political dramas.His script, the backbone of the film, along with its extraordinary production design, as well as the costume Design , make one feel part of the world of the famous scientist, especially for those of us who were lucky enough to see him in IMAX.This is a MUST see Movie for everyone..."
"3 hours of breathtaking cinema. Ignore the criticisms around the sound, or the length of the film. This is a masterful cinematic experience. It's packed with stars who all play their part, most of them understated but all helping to move this 'movie of 3 parts' forward.If Cillian Murphy doesn't win the Oscar for this performance then there is truly no justice. His stoic, understated performance is best in class. Amazing.Nolan once again blows me away and I loved it.Lastly, if the central theme doesn't scare the hell out of you then gos help us all!! When the move ended, there was silence in the cinema for 5 minutes. Not a sound. Just contemplation around what was unleashed at Los Alamos."
"Nolan simply does not miss.The only complaint I can think of for this film is that it's a tad too long. Other than that, it's basically a masterpiece.Every single performance is off the charts. Downey Jr. Surprised me the most with his dramatic and aggressive role. Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh were all fantastic as usual and didn't miss a beat anywhere in the runtime.It's Cillian Murphy however, that gives the most memorable, emotional, gut wrenching and insightful performance of the film. He is absolutely sublime. Watching him in this film made me proud to be Irish. Not only does he look like Dr. Oppenheimer, he sounds and moves just like him too. This will without a doubt be his defining role in the decades to come. He was quite literally perfect.Nolan is of course on the ball once again. The film looks amazing, sounds incredible and keeps the intensity throughout. There was one particular scene where I actually couldn't sit still. I was a sweating mess. But that's what films should do. They should take us to uncomfortable and difficult places and make us want more.This one will be remembered."
"I've thought about this movie ever since I first saw it.It's in depth look into one of the most important modern events is thorough and captivating. The people that are shown in this movie feel real, and all their choices make sense in a real world setting, which is to be expected from a biopic but is done fantastically here nonetheless.The acting from everyone is superb with of course Cillian being the stand-out, and the amount of recognisable faces is insane. You never feel like you are watching a movie, but rather experiencing one, and the music helps this to reach its full potential with a fantastic score; one of the best I've heard!The story is terrifyingly enthralling. I've never felt such emotions from a movie before and it really captivates the feeling of the fact you are in this world, and you'll have to deal with the consequences of the story.Truly a masterpiece I will not soon forget."
"I did the Barbenheimer thing and in that order. In my city, every Barbie screening is selling out and most Oppenheimer screenings are selling out. Oppenheimer was given the largest auditorium at my local cinema for evening screenings but they could only do one in that auditorium per evening due to length. The late Oppenheimer screening was in a tiny auditorium. Barbie only got matinees in the largest auditorium. Then old movies like Elemental and Across the Spiderverse wasted 4 evening screenings. Both films have hit the jackpot this weekend but this seemingly disorganized planning of what screens would show what could have been avoided. I guess theatre math must be more complicated than toilet paper math.Most of the audience in my screening were males 18-25. Interesting. It didn't take too long to figure out why. Florence's scenes. At this point, I should just assume that if it isn't a Disney/Marvel movie, she's going to be naked at some point. I saw several people get up and leave about halfway through the movie, I think because they knew her nude scenes were over. Now, speaking of nude scenes, I was not expecting to see Murphy in a creepy sex scene or sitting naked in a chair. It just wasn't pleasant. His acting is fine, I just want him fully clothed at all times.Back to the movie. Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and RDJ were great. If you like courtroom scenes, you'll probably love this. I was expecting more science and more relationships. I wasn't emotionally invested in any character.It wasn't a bad movie. It was way too long of a movie."
"Oppenheimer was a greedy war monger who could have blown up the world. The fact that people love this man so much is incredibly disturbing to say the least. It's like looking at Lex Luthor as being a superhero. Oppenheimer created the most awful invention in the history of humanity and he should be looked at with disdain, not applauded. If the world does get blown up by nuclear weapons it will be thanks to this man. I hope people understand that so they don't see this movie with rose colored glasses. War is hell and nuclear war is Armageddon. I don't worship war profiteers for that very reason."
"In Oppenheimer, everything deserves praise. The performances of the cast, especially the ones of Murphy and Downey Jr, story and what it deals with, direction, screenplay, cinematography, soundtrack, visual and sound effects, and production value, are all perfect and have nothing to be said against them.Regarding the flaws, what I criticized in Oppenheimer is the complex and missy storystelling in some parts and the 180 minutes runtime because to be honest, I felt that the movie didn't need more than 135 to 150 minutes. There were some parts that, from my point of view, were not so necessary and the movie did not need them to deliver its message.But these flaws won't prevent me from giving Oppenheimer a high score because all the other elements were excellent and deserve all praise. That is why when it comes to the score, I give Oppenheimer 9 out of 10."
"Do not read this if you have not watched it yet!Has anyone else got the feeling this film was actually about more than an actual plot? The hints seem to have appear throughout the movie and it was revealed in the final scene, in the conversation between Albert and Oppenheimer.To me, this movie was also about the destroying power of extreme political ideologies. Albert, being a symbol of far right Nazi Germany and Oppenheimer being a symbol of Soviet Communism. Just like in Molotov-Ribbentrop Nazi Soviet Pact which led directly to the outbreak of war, Oppenheimer reminds Einstein that while ""the bomb"" is still being contructed, they had fears that it might accidentally set in motion chain reaction that could destroy the entire world. The line "" I believe we did"" follows. As Nazi Germany fails, the communism continued the work of destruction in real life in history and is the biggest threat now than ever!"
"I love nolan as much as the next guy but movie not without a few flaws imo.Strengths
a dialogue driven movie that sustains 3 hours ( no small feat)bomb explosion build up/ tension3 timelines that can followsound/ cinematography.Nitpicks
Give me more ""how"" the atomic bomb was constructed. With 3 hours, 15 more min explaining or going into the process of achieving the bomb would have enhanced and given a healthy break from intense dialogue.I did some premovie research so helped but the movie kinda assumes you know whats going on from the start. Some explanation/backdrop on some characters may have helped audience.the movie is too long after the explosion. Im happy w final conclusion but def coulda tightened up without compromising.scene w pres truman, just did not resonate with me."
"The impact of an image, a sound, a vibration, all together to create emotions.Beauty unchained, fear unleashed.Christopher Nolan did it again. He gave us a masterpiece of a movie, even out of his comfort zone.The editing, camera work, themes, soundtracks, quotes, actors performances, were all on top level.I really can't say any negative thing about it.It was an explosive experience, dense and emotional.At the end of the movie, as the black screen came, half the people in the hall remained seated to contemplate the beauty. It was a magical moment, that really defines what real cinema should be like.An experience to bring home, a lesson to think about, an impact on our day and life.Thank you Nolan."
"I didn't give it 10 stars because it jumps around a lot chronologically, which is a very annoying current trend in film making, and can be confusing even if one's a history buff. Also because in typical Hollywood bleeding-heart-liberal fashion, it talked more about the destruction wrought by the atomic bombs than it did about the hundreds of thousands of civilian Japanese lives that were saved because of the bombs.Other than that, the acting was excellent, which is to be expected from a cast with four Academy Award winners, a two-time Academy Award nominee, and a few BAFTA winners and nominees. The fX were spectacular as well."
"This movie does many things well, including production value, the characters, and the story itself. If you like Nolan films, you are going to thoroughly enjoy this.As with most Nolan films, it has an intricately woven story that you have to really pay attention to. But the story is amazing. Three hours and I didn't look at my phone once.The main character Oppenheimer played by Cillian Murphy was amazing. The character had great character development, as well as a great story arc.The production value was amazing. The cinematography was great in the score as always with any Nolan film is amazing.What struck me most about this film was at times it almost seemed like a thriller. There were no major action scenes, or ""jump"" scares which makes the production value even better."
"I dont what to write about this Masterful craft which is so finely done. Every Pixel on the screen served its purpose. Its a biography of one of the most influential physicist of all time. Oppenheimer's character played by Cillian Murphy was just PERFECT. The intensity, complexity and tragedy of the brilliant minds of that time is portrayed like never before.. Also the cast overall is brilliant and unique. World war 2 is the most impactful event of the history of mankind. Personally its very intriguing to me and I love to study the history of our ancestors. The movie portrays the agony and guilt that came afterwards in the life of Oppenheimer. How he was comflicted within himself. How his agony eats him alive and how he was later misunderstood because of his character. I urge people to witness history like never before."
"Solid acting performances by Cillian Murphy and RDJ. Technical aspects like the cinematography, sound, editing, etc were all pretty flawless. All in all, a great biopic on Oppenheimer.But I don't get the hype around the movie. It was good, but not even Nolan's best. I found The Prestige, Inception and Interstellar his far better works.90% movie is dialogue from different time periods, with a lot of jargon being thrown around, in rooms or open fields. There's barely any special effects or CGI. So I don't get the hype of watching it on IMAX, that didn't enhance the overall viewing experience.A solid 8 rating, but I don't think it's another Nolan masterpiece. Definitely a good movie, but it's not something you have to see it now in theatres. You won't miss out on a lot of you wait for it to drop on Netflix or Prime Video in a few months."
"Tries to do too much in its three-hour run time. It should have been a much tighter 90-minute narrative.The film attempts to weave together too many stories, topics, and characters, resulting in a convoluted and cluttered narrative. The story might have been better suited to a mini-series format, similar to HBO's ""Chernobyl.""Historic characters, including prominent physicists, are portrayed in a ham-fisted, over-the-top manner that lacks authenticity.Certain scenes, such as Oppenheimer reading Sanskrit during a sex scene, are silly and outrageous. It felt absurd at that point.The early parts of the film are cringe-inducing in their heavy-handed attempts to portray Oppenheimer as a prodigy, through awkward name-dropping of book titles, famous physicists, and politicians.A significant missed opportunity is the film's refusal to delve into the complexities of theoretical physics. Instead, it oversimplifies the subject, relying on clichéd scenes that fail to do justice."
"At the end of the day, what is the ultimate goal of any movie? It's to present a character or a list of characters in such a way that you give a damn about what happens to them. You care about their successes and their failures. They may be the type of people that you personally have never met, or ever will, yet you still see some common human element between yourself and the character/s in question. Oppenheimer is a failure at the level of making me care about Oppenheimer the person.There were a handful of scenes where I felt I was able to appreciate the sense of moral weight and guilt Oppenheimer was feeling as the father of atomic bomb. The rest of the 3 hour movie vacillated between idolizing Oppenheimer the historical figure and going off track from the theme of the horror of nuclear weapons. Peppered in with awkward romantic subplots that only served to stymie the main plot.I used to think that romance is bad in Nolan's movies because he just didn't get romantic love. After watching this movie, I take it back. Nolan may not have a good understanding of what it means to be a human that has lived a vivacious life filled with thoughts and feelings that are forever one's own. I did not care about Oppenheimer the person going into the movie, and I still do not care about Oppenheimer the person after watching this movie.Not recommended."
"I've seen fair amount of biography movies and all of them have one thing in common...Though the characters are unique and interesting, those movies will feel streched and boring at most parts.... Though this is one of the longest movie I've watched, yet never felt boring or like any scenes added for filler. And combined with a stellar dialogues, the movie never slowed down on its entire run.I've known the actors are talented beforehand, but Nolan chose the actors that somehow best represent the characters according to the individual actor's strong points.Considering most Nolan movies are perfect and different, Oppenheimer is in my opinion the finest of his work. Considering, this is not an original movie which gives script freedom, but a biography with so little to deviate to make the film interesting, most the director can do is in the screenplay, dialogues, pacing and actor's presence. In this regard Nolan nailed it to perfection.One of a kind biography - Solid Movie."
"Oppenheimer is an incredibly thrilling biopic following the father of the atomic bomb.The acting in this film is excellent. Each member of the cast, no matter how small of a role, shines. Some standouts include Cillian Murphy as the lead alongside Kitty, played by Emily Blunt. Cillian Murphy not only looks the part, being stripped down to a skeletal frame of a man, with haunting and disturbed eyes, he acts the part as well. All of Oppenheimer's emotions are captured through the miniscule details of Murphy's performance and he's incredible at portraying such a complex and controversial historical figure. While in the background at first, Emily Blunt shines, especially in the film's third act, where her character takes charge in many pivotal moments. Much like Oppenheimer, Kitty must deal with the trials of being connected to such an important, yet violent part of history. Through these two performances, the film's historical figures truly come to life, being presented as multifaceted, flawed people that engage the audience.Every element of film, from score to cinematography, is perfectly displayed by Christopher Nolan, who has truly mastered his craft. While many may see the film's premise, a 3 hour film mostly filled with dialogue, following the man who built the atomic bomb, as boring and tedious, Nolan uses the elements of film to thrill viewers, creating tension in dialogue heavy scenes. Conversations about physics and treason are quickly interrupted by haunting visuals of pillars of fire, stars exploding, and molecular collisions. By telling a story from a truly subjective, character based perspective, the audience is thrown into the psyche of the film's titular character, viewing his thoughts and actions. One could compare the use of these film elements to Across the Spider-Verse, which used animation to its fullest. Much like that film, Oppenheimer uses live action film to its fullest.Perhaps the only weaknesses, if you can even call them that, of this film are its fast pace and attention to detail. The fast pace is used to blaze through Oppenheimer's tumultuous life, allowing the film's runtime to feel much shorter than it actually is. This can be detrimental to some viewers as characters quickly appear and disappear throughout the movie, along with many details that may feel mundane and insignificant. But, these characters and small details become incredibly vital to the film's excellent final act, which rewards those who have stayed laser-focused throughout the film.Oppenheimer is an excellent film, which may not be for everyone, that is certainly worth a try.10/10."
"A thrilling, well-written story, elevated by awe-inspiring cinematography and a tremendous score. Murphy and RDJ are superb, intricate, gripping. Smaller roles, like those of Casey Affleck and Jason Clarke, were jaw-dropping as well, showcasing the true power that Nolan brings to the table: a movie fueled by passion - where everyone brings their utmost - just to be a part of something incredible. Sharp, witty dialogue propels these performances, and the terrific pacing, like a bomb ticking down to zero, had me glued to the screen for the entire run-time.As the end credits roll, it is impossible not to sit in terror, in shock, but also in wonder. Before the big philosophical questions set in, a more simple question emerged in my mind:
where am I?The beauty of cinema, encapsulated by Nolan, who himself, like Oppenheimer, is a genius.10/10."
"The truth is that Christopher Nolan is an excellent director, presenting us with extremely ambitious, interesting and successful themes in his films.All his films are good (with the exception, in my opinion, of ""tenet"" (too much ambition sometimes doesn't work) and ""dunkirk"" (very good technically but with completely empty characters, making it impossible to empathize with any of them)).I said before that ""all of Nolan's films are good"": Trilogy ""batman"", ""inception"", ""the prestige"", ""interstellar"", ""memento"", etc., etc.But none is magnificent, none is masterpiece. Not even close. When will have a magnificent film from Nolan? When will so many people stop saying that Christopher is an ""overrated"" director?It will be with this ""oppenheimer"" that finally
is Nolan truly going to ""kill it"" once and for all?I hope so! He (Christopher Nolan) deserves it.I gave all CN films an 8/10, with the exception of the aforementioned ""tenet"" and ""dunkirk"", which I gave a 7/10. I look forward to giving it a 9!All that's missing is a leap to ""magnificent"" instead of ""good""."
"This is so far the best movie I've seen this year, I'm intrigued to see where it will stand on the list by end of the year!!(Directing / Story)
Oppenheimer is cinema at its finest. Christopher Nolan's versatile directorial abilities leave us in awe with a monumental cinematic masterpiece of a harrowing powerful story.Nolan's dialogue-heavy and dense science narrative is captivating with its focused details, the movie is built with such an intricate structure that allows every piece of the complex historical drama to unfold at a combination of fast and steady pace while building extreme ongoing tension and uneasiness over the long runtime that profoundly shakes you. Also big props for that is on the editing, the jumps between events and their timelines were seamless.I love the directorial choice to communicate through J. Robert Oppenheimer's point of view, allowing the viewer to explore a glimpse inside of his full of abstract ideas mind, and along that playing with the objective v.s subjective narrative shifts projecting the other perspectives that capture the storylines from different directions which bring up a lot of curious questions to the viewer's mind trying to understand choices and motives!The story is not just about historical events instead it's Nolan's thought-provoking showcase diving us deep into the radicality of mass destruction from a sequence of events led by the seek for greatness, the exploration of the minds behind the actions, their frightening obsessive ambition with power and blindness of its catastrophic consequences on humanity on the long run, and haunting internalized battles of moral dilemmas. (There were 2 specific breathtaking scenes where it entirely left me intrigued on the edge of my seat!!!)(Cinematography)
Nolan's long-run collaboration with Hoyte van Hoytema is one of the most rewarding things from this experience as a viewer who admires his work. He goes all out and he always delivers highly.I loved loved loved the cinematography, although the visuals were crafted on the simple and not spectacular stylized side yet it was highly effective and achieved the exact emotional depth and realism portrayed it needed to.The sense of intimacy with the characters was so well done with the astonishing close-ups that reflected proximity and somewhat removes the barrier of a screen. The immersiveness of the camera language takes you as a viewer into the rooms as if you're part of the conversations and enables you to observe and focus on details of the environment and crucial moments of history, this is exactly what they wanted to achieve and they nailed it!Also utilizing the visuals to play with perspectives through shifting between color and black-and-white sequences was a beautiful nuanced touch that was transformative in the storytelling and also added up creatively.On a technical level, the way they seek after new inventions of film stocks and use first-time black and white color specs customized for shooting on that grandest scale of IMAX film cameras with a focus to deliver to the viewer's realistic perception is an unmatched level of dedication to the craft from both Hoyte van Hoytema and Nolan, it is a study on pushing boundaries.(Performances / Characters)
The character development is a masterclass, the depths of exploring the character's psychology and indulging the audience in their emotional journeys are palpably felt through the screen.The cast was on their A game, no matter the length of their screen presence, it's going to be a tight race for the upcoming awards season!Cillian Murphy owned the screen, his embodiment of the character was flawless and intensely mesmerizing, the way he portrayed complexity, especially with the internalized burden of the ethical intellectuality that was something!!Followed by Robert Downey Jr's remarkable versatile performance that easily stands him out with a powerful role!! Outstanding work from Emily Blunt she nailed that one specific scene big time. So did Matt Dameon with another great hit for the year, and Florence Pugh which I wished to see more of her but understandable why not but regardless I always love her acting.(Score / Sound Design)
The cherry on top of powerful storytelling and astonishing visuals is breathtaking score and sound design. The soundscape in this movie uplifts the experience to another level with its ability to suck your emotions in, and the way it's delicately crafted to indulge you with the visual dynamics builds successfully on the whole cinematic experience.Hot take: I like that it was Ludwig Göransson on this score instead of Zimmer, obviously Zimmer is phenomenal but Ludwig added the right spice to this movie specifically."
"My first ever movie review and thank god it's Oppenheimer. Was so invested in it who knew 3 hours had gone by. We talk about Murphy but damn RDJ was exceptional. Well that's on the acting front and Nolan is Nolan, adopted this biopic into it's own style excellently with great character. Each character playing its role brilliantly. And THAT trinity test, wow that was one to watch. You were forced to keep your eye on the screen just so that you might not miss something. Surely will go down as one of the iconic scenes. Now what do I even say about the score every scene had its own mood and complementing each moment exquisitely. Wow. What more can I just say just don't know. This is surely one not to miss."
"Oppenheimer is a cinematic masterpiece that leaves a lasting impact. The direction is top-notch, guiding the audience through a compelling narrative. The performances are outstanding, with each actor delivering their role with confidence - the only exception being Gary Oldman, whose delivery feels a bit weak . The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing every scene with artistic brilliance. The seamless sound-mixing adds depth to the immersive experience. Despite its 3-hour runtime, the plot keeps you engaged - even though it is heavily dialogue based - making time fly by. This film is bound to evoke strong reactions; you'll either fall in love with its brilliance or feel like it falls short . For cinephiles seeking an intellectually stimulating journey, ""Oppenheimer"" is a must-watch."
"Oppenheimer, the film from Christopher Nolan has usurped Russians from Dream of the Blue Turtles as the leading edge of cultural awareness for ""father of the atomic bomb"". In that song, Sting flippantly introduced the subject as ""Oppenheimer's deadly toy"". In reality his relationship was much more complex with nuclear weapons than that; but kudos to Sting for introducing a name to millions of folks who otherwise wouldn't have heard it until now. Oppenheimer is a big film in the most Christopher Nolan manner possible. It's a three-hour dramatic tour de force that grabs viewers by their shirt collars and maintains its grip for the vast majority of its run time.Unlike Nolan's other works, Oppenheimer is driven by dramatic sequences, tight dialogue, and acting that's top-notch. There aren't any big action sequences, but viewers who want a breathtaking overview of the Atomic Bomb, its creation and after-effects will be mesmerized. That's all the more amazing because there are about two dozen characters as the film jumps between a 20-year era in history. Those characters are all memorable and their role in Oppenheimer's life and work are always clear, unless they aren't.This is a Christopher Nolan film after all, and some scenes are truncated or have certain lines of dialogue not audible. Those lines or scenes will be seen later in the film, but only when they need to be shown in order to crystallize plot threads. Nolan also uses black and white film to contrast the setting, tone, timing and perspective of the story in a near-perfect manner. There's a reason why some scenes are in color and others aren't. Some characters are shown in a flashback in black and white, then immediately shown in the current story in color, or vice versa. When you see the film, this effect is akin to a chess match that the characters are having.As a film, Oppenheimer is very difficult not to look at. There are dozens of scenes that were filmed close-up, with the minute details of the actor's faces or bodies filling up the screen. And because this is a character-driven film, there are many more opportunities for people to fill the scenes than Nolan's other works.The first act of the film is more of an artistic painter's approach to Oppenheimer as a person, than a traditional movie. There are short, chaotic cuts and close-ups of Cillian Murphy interspersed with micro close-ups of the stages of explosions, reactions and wires that are reacting to electrical charges. This part of Oppenheimer focuses on his early educational life as the background, but it's being presented in hindsight because he is currently being questioned by a Congressional panel.He's a very gifted student who is well-networked, but also mischievous, too direct at times and keenly aware that he's usually the smartest person in the room. As a teacher, he wants to engage in theoretical physics and the concept of energy relating to collapsing stars and the blackness of space. He is also very open-minded, even to those with radical ideas on campus. Because of this, he makes numerous friends in a school communist organization, which unfortunately comes back to haunt him.The classroom next to his is working on a machine that will research, and hopefully split, atoms. As the world's drumbeats to WWII get louder his classes get bigger and his knowledge of physics gets more useful.The world's top physicists have been captured or are working with the Nazis. When they make a key breakthrough in nuclear power Oppenheimer realizes that the world is racing towards weaponizing this new technology. The lab next to his classroom is able to replicate what the Germans did and he's given the chance to form his own team.Oppenheimer teams up with a U. S. General and they create their own research facility in Los Alamos. It's a city where they all live with their families and can conduct testing and research with minimal delay. The film does a great job of making the potentially incomprehensible process of nuclear reactions, bombs, and the science behind them something that non-tech folks can understand. When you see Benny Safdie as Edward Teller talking about a different delivery method for the bomb that could prove more efficient you're able to follow the logic.The success of the bomb's testing starts Oppenheimer's concerns about responsibly using that power. The end of WWII brings even more issues as he runs afoul of certain politicians, which results in his inquiry that started the movie.Oppenheimer is a powerful film that ranks alongside Schindler's List in terms of a war or combat film that will stand the test of time. It's impossible not to compare the two films in terms of quality and deftly telling a story to audiences that aren't familiar with its titular character. The final act of the film focuses on McCarthyism and communist hearing, where his past history, as well as that of his wife and peers, will resonate with folks today.Could you really be held accountable for one meeting that you had with someone a decade and a half ago? Your actions have always been solid, but those who seek you harm are focusing on that meeting or perhaps the beliefs of a second-tier associate. Could you really be held accountable just for RT something on social media? Your actions are solid, but those who don't think like you do will do anything to cause you harm. McCarthyism and the public's zeal to believe or jump on the bandwagon of those who said something on social media that runs counter to what they believe have much in common.Oppenheimer was an independent thinker who wasn't afraid to surround himself with people who question his work or beliefs. While the movie, Oppenheimer was indeed a fantastic piece of cinema, I hope that the irony of those who persecuted him isn't lost on all of audiences and the similarities that they might share."
"Let's be clear about this, the film is NOT about the story of the race to build the first nuke. There is NOTHING here about the Axis effort to build the bomb. This film is just about Oppenheimer, and it's not even a biopic in the true sense, it's just the story of HIS effort to build the bomb, with the assistance of a group of mostly Jewish scientists. Murphy is completely superb in the role, he IS Oppenheimer! This is one of the best acting performances I've ever seen and if Murphy doesn't pick up an Oscar then this world is mad. The storyline itself gets wrapped up in Oppenheimer's personal life and his later struggles to avoid being labelled as a communist and a security risk. There is little about Oppenheimer's early life and his family background; you are often made to feel that he was some kind of heroic figure when in truth he was a very flawed human being. There is even a scene when Oppenheimer's wife worries about him losing his job and their nice home - total BS because Oppenheimer was a rich man independently of his job. He inherited the equivalent of $4M in today's money when his father died early on in Oppenheimer's life and certainly would not have worried about losing his job. His job was a hobby, an obsessive hobby that he was brilliant at , but a hobby all the same - he did not need it to survive. The investigation story later on in the film was boring and lengthy, stretching out the film at least half an hour more than needed. It's necessary to call out Robert Downey Jr as Oppenheimer's FBI nemesis, Lewis Strauss, for a brilliant acting performance, and credit also needs to go to Benny Safdie as Edward Teller and David Krumholtz as Isidor Rabi, both of whom were excellent. The bit parts played by Branagh, Conti and Oldman were, predictably, executed superbly by these masterful actors. The female cast was a disappointment, but then they didn't have much material to get their teeth into, so hardly surprising. Overall I give this film 7 out of 10 for the great acting, but the storyline was poorly handled by Nolan, not one of my favourite directors. Lastly, the very loud sounds and music (if you call it that) during the film ruined much of the enjoyment."
"Despite many great performances (with few exceptions) and an interesting story, it is all too long, too complex and frequently boring.However, it is a film to see, but at home not in a cinema.Concerning Christopher Nolan's performance, I consider it overall negative. The main problem is the forced rithm, with forced changes of stories, changes of color and black and white, cacophonic music. It all sounds and looks like an unorganized orchestra, who wants to give a good impression but tries too hard.In the end, I had the impression that too many small stories were told, leaving the main story to be told as a sidestory in the last minutes."
"This movie was everything I had hoped and so much more.Every actor and actress is perfectly cast but Cillian Murphy especially gives the performance of a lifetime.""Oppenheimer"" doesn't feel 3 hours long, due to Nolans ability to make every scene and conversation feel important. The black and white sequences makes you see things in a different light and is an amazing way to distinguish the tone of certain scenes. And in some cases what actually happend.The music is brilliant and helps build tension in scenes where even though you as a viewer already know the outcome, you can't help but sit on the edge of your seat in anticipation of what happens.A solid 10 out of 10."
"Christopher Nolan has created unbelievably powerful film about events that changed world forever.Early 1900's. Golden age of science. Scientists like Albert Einstein, Niles Bohr, Otto Hahn, Enrico Fermi, Werner Heisenberg and of course J. Robert Oppenheimer. Changing world and our understanding of it unbelievably fast.This is Oppenheimer's story. Story combining science, war and politics. When scientists were recruited to create most powerful weapon.Manhattan project. Oppenheimer as it's leader. Trinity test. His life around that moment. His politics and personal relationships.This film did give me everything I hoped and even more. My personal interests are mostly in biology and chemistry. But i consider myself having above average knowledge of quantum physics and history around it. And I'm really interested it as subject. So I think this film is to me is close to feeling, that superhero fans feel, when they see all their favorite heroes on big screen.Just unbelievably powerful experience to science nerd like me. All those scientists and events in history that i have only read and seen documentaries about.Technical masterpiece to sound and visuals. Just amazing cinematography.I absolutely loved unique structure of this film. Small details really did make this film something so beautiful.And I haven't even written about incredible ensemble cast this film has. Cillian Murphy is wonderful as J. Robert Oppenheimer. But also Robert Downey Jr. , Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and so many amazing supporting performances. So many familiar faces.Everything this just created perfect package.This rewiew was very lengthy one because me rambling about my toughts.But I just loved this film so much."
"Something unbelievably powerful and breathtaking.As cinematic experience this is something i haven't felt in a while.But as science lover, this hits me even somewhere deeper.What Christopher Nolan did with theory of relativity in Interstellar, he now did with quantum mechanics in Oppenheimer.How science changed world forever.Story of Manhattan project and it's leader, J Robert Oppenheimer told with best way i wouldn't even imagined.How some of the greatest scientists in world contributed in creating most destructive weapon of mankind.And aftermath of world after Trinity test.Oppenheimer's personal struggles around that event.Thriller like epic drama, with amazing and unique structure.Amazing character study that combines science, politics and philosophy in so fascinating way.This film really portrays complicated nature of J. Robert Oppenheimer so well.Brilliant mind, with complicated relationships and connections.Very scientific film.In between this and my first viewing, i also did read little more history about diffrent historical figures included in this film.It turns out that this film is very historically accurate.So many great details.Most inaccuracies are just mostly nitpicking.There is only couple bigger dramatizations that made this films structure clearer vision.This films structure overall really opened me on this second viewing even more.All characters ans their motivations are much more clear to me now.Whole insane ensemble cast.From amazing performance of Cillian Murphy to even some of the smallest characters.Now i also noticed more of the greatness of supporting performances of Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and of course Robert Downey Jr.Importance of their characters in life of J. Robert Oppenheimer.Every one of them had different roles in his life.Now i had more time to appreciate technical greatness of this film.From beaitifil cinematography to amazingly haunting score.On this watch this film became even greater to me.I don't say this lightly, but this film might be some of the greatest of this decade in so many ways."
"Written by Ian Chandler - July 21, 2023Film director Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" is one of his most ambitious projects yet. From the fact that it is not a sci-fi thriller to it being Nolan's first R-rated picture in over two decades, ""Oppenheimer"" is quite experimental for Christopher Nolan, who happens to be a very experimental filmmaker. Even so, the film has plenty of his trademark methods, including a strange, but effective way of playing with time itself. Even more impressive is his commitment to minimizing VFX shots and shooting every frame using expensive IMAX film. Though I did not have the pleasure to see it in its 70mm glory, I still applaud a modern motion picture for sticking with it. Additionally, the film manages to feel just as massive in scope despite being a gripping drama rather than an action-packed thriller.J. Robert Oppenheimer, played by Cillian Murphy, is a complex character who expresses so many emotions in the film without going overboard. His behavior is never extreme, with that said, he can be considered the most emotional person on the Manhattan project. Speaking of the Manhattan project, the film achieves something not often seen in movies: the lead character does not get all of the credit for the mission. No, he does not figure out every formula needed for the A-bomb. No, he is not responsible for the idea of a hydrogen bomb. He works with other fellow scientists as a team to create a devastating weapon in desperate times. This includes strong performances from Matt Damon, Alden Ehrenreich, Kenneth Branagh, and more. The blood-pumping ""Trinity"" test is impressive as a piece of storytelling, a representation of history, and as a sequence of stellar practical effects.His scientific projects are not the only aspects showcased in ""Oppenheimer."" His relationships with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) and Kitty (Emily Blunt) are explored several times throughout the film. Tatlock's complicated story with Oppenheimer is interesting, but in some ways distracting. Not to be prude here, but I saw some interactions to be needlessly edgy instead of fascinating due to the decision of the characters' nude bodies being shown for an extensive period. Not only does it encourage immodest behavior from the audience, but it also will distract many from the film as it is an adult drama that happens to contain two scenes that are gratuitous and uncomfortable. I would desire for Nolan to focus more on Tatlock's dialogue than her breasts, please. I'm not suggesting Oppenheimer's sexual life to be removed either, as it is important to his character later on. I simply believe the film would feel more mature if it were to be less vulgar; perhaps shoulders and up would keep the tension alive without making some of the viewers feel like perverts. Finally, this wouldn't be so distracting if it weren't for the fact that the rest of the film is at a PG-13 level. Kitty's relationship with Oppenheimer is a more gripping story and a better showcase of an independent woman from the 1940s. She's hot-tempered, but strong in her opinions, especially in the film's final hour. Emily Blunt's performance as the character is a solid one, and just about matches Murphy's excellent performance as the film's protagonist.""Oppenheimer's"" score, composed by Ludwig Göransson, is atmospheric and wonderful. Emphasizing on the violin and intensifying the bass levels, the soundtrack enhances the weight of Oppenheimer's actions, emotions, and the events surrounding him. The score alone warrants the film to be seen in theaters, preferably those with the best sound equipment. ""Ground Zero"" and ""Can You Hear the Music"" in particular were the ones that stood out to me. Göransson has cemented himself to be among the greatest film composers such as Hans Zimmer and Thomas Newman.A major part of the film happens to be about shifting perspectives, which is told by changing between black-and-white and color. I refuse to elaborate much further as it is best to experience this upon viewing the film instead of reading it from a review. If one is quite rusty with their WWII history, the film may be a bit daunting to follow; however, if one is aware about the basics, such as when mentioned U. S. presidents were in office, then the rapidly changing time-periods should not be a problem to keep track of. Robert Downy Jr. May have played his best performance yet as Lewis Strauss. If I were to provide more details about his character, it may damper the mystery and complexity of his story before one decides to view it for themselves.""Oppenheimer"" shines not only as a historical biopic, but also as a tense thriller. There is no action (thankfully), but there is constant suspense as well as several characters to care about in this film. If one is a fan of WWII history, a fan of Nolan's filmography, and a fan of cinema, ""Oppenheimer"" is a wonderful picture that will please them immensely. Please see Oppenheimer's story on how he transformed from a brilliant scientist to a disturbed embodiment of ""death, the destroyer of worlds.""Oppenheimer - 89/100
Oppenheimer is a gripping biopic that keeps one interested throughout its three-hour runtime, despite being plagued by occasional, needlessly vulgar scenes."
"What else more is there to say? A great movie. Christopher Nolan has yet done it again as he has done many times. Fantastic actors, you couldn't ask for better performers. The sounds of the movie made it that much better, if you have the chance, listen to it in theaters before it's off the big screen. Timeline was a bit chaotic putting in the present and the future but not overpowering. I was very excited to see the movie when the trailer first got released and I was not let down like many other movies I have seen with hype. 9/10 because even though it was a 3 hour movie, it was very high paced and you wouldn't be able to afford to miss some time. Giving it a 9.5 if it had the option I would. Christopher Nolan does it again."
"First and foremost, I thought this was a terrific movie, the acting performances were just outstanding. There are already plenty of reviews extolling the performances, and so I'll focus instead on some constructive criticism and helpful advice instead.A few things are enough to bring this movie down from a ""10"":1. The hype about watching this movie in IMAX was overblown. This movie has A LOT OF DIALOGUE, and lots of scenes of two people talking to each other, and so.... guess what, the bulk of that glorious 70mm IMAX footage is of two talking heads shot in glorious 70mm IMAX closeup. So yeah, unless you really enjoy analyzing the makeup progression on Cillian Murphy's face, from a callow youth with a clean fresh faced complexion and wild hair, to the beginnings of wrinkles and eyebags and a few gray hairs, well, that 70mm screen isn't really necessary, to be honest2. Reading some of the history before watching the history will help a lot to understand this movie when watching it for the first time, otherwise you will be as totally lost as I was when watching Nolan's ""Tenet"". Once again, Nolan breaks up the movie into roughly 4 different time segments, and presents them in flashback and out of sequence jumbled order. As a history buff and having read a lot of this history already, it all made sense to me, but anybody else would get easily confused.3. Subtitles would help! I've gotten so used to watching things digitally with the closed captioning or subtitles that I really wished there were subtitles available (I do plan to watch this movie again once it goes digital, with subtitles turned on). Even with the IMAX theater's speakers turned on full blast to an almost uncomfortable level, it was still hard to hear some of the whispered dialogue.5. Nolan needs to bring Hans Zimmer back. I guess the two broke up when Zimmer took on ""Dune"" instead of ""Tenet"", but Ludwig Göransson's music just isn't in the same class of powerful memorable themes, and was even grating at times.Despite these relatively minor complaints, this was a great movie. There were a few tiny almost cameo roles that turned out to have great significance as the ending wrapped up - another Nolan trait. Watch for Rami Malek - he is so instantly recognizable that I wondered what the heck he was doing there as an extra just standing there in the background in one scene, and fumbling a clipboard on Oppenheimer in his second scene, and then he appears as the surprise witness in the Senate confirmation hearings of Oppenheimer's arch enemy Lewis Strauss.Go see this movie in the theaters, it's worth it. Then watch it again on digital streaming, with subtitles."
"Christopher Nolan knocks it out of the park with Oppenheimer. The film is a delight, and is truly meant for the big screen. The ensemble cast assembled for the project deliver the goods.Glad to see Cillian Murphy's loyalty to Nolan, get rewarded with a leading and an impactful role. The cinematography, music were just flawless.While some might feel the film was a tad too long, I disagree with them. 3 hours was totally justifiable for the way the story was paced, and kept me gripped the whole time.The film is the perfect representation of what humans are capable of in our darkest moments."
"I am an actor and I know the hard work that went into this film.I have just three sentences to make after watching Oppenheimer.1. Feel lucky that you are born in this era to witness such a grand cinema.2. Thank god hitler never got access to Atom bomb.3. The Trinity test, the name is inspired by the three faced god Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh And a full quote from Bhagwad Geeta in the movie.A proud moment for Indian Mythology in context of global cinema. Please watch it.Now coming to the performances.When you walk out your face will behave as if it has turned into Cillian Murphy. You will also behave like one.Very heavy lifting done by Matt Damon, Robert D Jr and Jason Clark. Actors should learn that a good project is bigger then any level of stardom.-Ashrut Jain, India."
"1- An atomic bomb test scene that a child could have directed better.2- An atomic bomb movie without actually narrating nor showing the events of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bomb drop off.3- An atomic bomb movie without showing burning bodies and fire melting people and any of the suffering of those injured.4- An atomic bomb movie totally not caring about the actual people who got hurt by the bomb (Japanese people) but rather on americans being heroes and focusing on turning the maker of the bomb a hero and him being a victim of personal grudges and communist stuff and personal enemies like we actually care about any of that.5- A 3-hour movie that could have been easily 2-hours without any damage.6- After 3 hours you still don't know if Oppenheimer had feelings of suffering or regret of he did nor any personal conflicts he was having.7- An Einstein actor who looks like a Shawarma restaurant chef with very cheesy lines to say.Well, what a disappointment from Nolan and what an over-hyped movie. If there is anything good with this movie is the incredible performance of Robert Downey Jr in addition to one or two cinematic shots where Oppenheimer face was still and his background was shaking but that's pretty much it !!"
How in the world this is close to a 9 I don't understand.They need to have a University Class on the subject and characters and the reward of graduating the class with 80% or higher is going to see the movie. What happened to entertainment - my brain was tired in the first hour. First of all - TURN DOWN THE SOUNDTRACK! I would highly recommend that you skip the theatre and wait until it comes out on a device you can get close captioning on as the soundtrack overwhelms all of the dialogue and you can't hear what they are saying which might have helped understand it. I was begging for CC. I think there was one chuckle in the movie - so dark and depressing and muddled. I truly hated this movie even after reading up on the material. Just don't get the high ratings. Maybe people don't want to admit they don't get what is going on? SKIP IT. SERIOUSLY.
"Oppenheimer is a masterclass in movie direction but for an average movie aficionado, it's a decent movie with stunning sound design and masterful acting. I am a huge Nolan fan and even with so much hype, he still doesn't disappoint. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is devastatingly magnificent and is extremely well supported by every single one of the cast including good actors playing small cameos. The sound design was one of the best I have heard in recent times. What impressed me the most was the restraint and subtlety exercised while telling this story. In hands of any other director, this could have very easily become a jingoistic and pathos-inducing average movie. So many of Nolan's stories work because of the emotions and bonds behind all the other stuff but i found that part a bit lacking here and that would be my only critique. For me it's a 9.5/10 movie but for a normal movie goer it would be 7.5-8/10 movie."
"Oppenheimer is a movie which is not interested in showing any combat sequences of World War II, but instead focuses on the politics and the invention of the bomb that was supposed to end all wars. It is also an exploration of guilt of Oppenheimer as well as the petty politics behind the scene.Cillian Murphy completely steals the show and guarantees himself an Academy nod. He perfectly captures the guilt of the scientist. There are dialogues which gave me genuine chills. Robert Downey is also brilliant in his performance. He completely sheds his Iron Man persona to the point where he is almost unrecognizable. He steps into the shoes of Levi Strauss. In a certain way, this might be his magnum opus. Other actors like Matt Damon, Rami Malek, Florence Pugh also contribute to the movie in their own brilliant ways.I was a big fan of the cinematography of the film. Even though I couldn't watch it in IMAX, the visuals of the movie still managed to mesmerize me. The camera beautifully captures the scenic view of Los Alamos. The sound design also complements the film, as the sound of explosion has a tendency to horrify you.The dialogues in the film are a treat to anyone who enjoys a film for the conversation rather than big set pieces. The opining line itself would be mentioned in the zeitgeist for years to come. The dialogues also helps to bring the nuances of each character and also refuses to insult the intelligence of its audience, trusting the viewer to know about the intricacies and doesn't dumb it down for them.Lastly I want to praise the horrifying visuals in certain sequences, which brilliantly captures the horrors of war, and does justice to the victims of World War 2. Even though it doesn't have any combat sequences, the visuals still can terrify you, and could basically be the source of envy for many horror directors.However, the runtime is too exhausting, making it unsuitable for repeated viewings. After the dropping of the bombs, the courtroom drama takes too much of the runtime, instead of tying everything up in a neat bow."
"Christopher Nolan's oppenhimer is a brilliantly amazing movie. It is a 3 hours long story telling which is absolutely amazing and the way Nolan has presented this movie is something that I loved the most especially the minor details in the movie like Richard fryman dening to have waldyers glass to view the trinity test. The background score is also very very brilliant. The Nolan has created an absolutely brilliant art, this is story telling at its finest with the background score, with the acting, with the makeup, with the production, with the direction, with the story telling, script writing everything being top notch. Cillian Murphy kills as an oppenhimer and RDJ is also amazing, the last one hour Robert Downey junior kills it, while the first two hours goes to cillian Murphy, and without a doubt the supporting cast is also done an absolutely brilliant job. I particularly Loved the way Nolan has presented the story in such a complexly amazing way. If you can sit for 3 hours with focus and bit of knowledge about the subject (oppenhimer) I am sure you will enjoy the movie to the fullest. I can see some people are not enjoying the movie that much, I think they are lacking some knowledge which revolves around this topic of atomic nuclear bomb, Manhattan project, and oppenhimer. (Which is totally normal btw)"
"Christopher Nolan is just an absolute god when it comes to cinematography and this movie is no exception!It is basically a supercharged biography of Oppenheimers life and his work, but done in the best possible way. Chillian Murphy as Oppenheimer was an amazing decision, because he fits absolutely perfect.The movie shows perfectly, how bad and descructive humans can be. It was really interesting to see, how big of an impact a new physics discovery can have on the entire world. Especially today, it is more than important to know, what could happen if nuclear bombs were used in war.In conclusion I can only say, that this movie was simply amazing. Of course there are Christopher Nolan movies, that more people will like, but this was something different and new in the best possible way!"
"This movie is extremely well crafted. From the first second to the last, you are sucked into the life of Oppenheimer. The acting, cinematography and soundtracks are just perfectly harmonious together.Cilian Murphy gives an Oscar-worthy performance that is terrifying yet pleasing to watch. The supporting actors went above and beyond and performed their roles to perfection.What more could one ask for? This is a movie that will be remembered for decades to come. It is a masterpiece crafted by Christopher Nolan that exceeded all my expectations.Watch it in IMAX if you still have the time. You will regret not doing so."
"""Now I Am Become Death, Destroyer of Worlds""O P P E N H E I M E RWow... What a cinematic achievement from Christopher Nolan and crew. The directing is fluid and I'm not sure I've seen better from Nolan in regards to the more emotional scenes. The script never stops, constantly ebbing and flowing in and out of time periods, yet somehow feeling smooth despite the jumpiness of the script. It felt like the script was trying to emulate how this physicist mind works, fast and ever-changing. I've heard it described as the scenes feeling like someone has Attention Deficit Disorder commanding the reins, and I can kind of see why, but I like the choice to do the jump cutting so the film didn't feel boring.Each character is fairly well drawn out, especially our protagonist played excellently by Cillian Murphy. This is the best piece of acting I've seen from him up this date. The film rests on his shoulders, and not only did he live up to the task, he elevates the material in every scene he's in. He was my favorite performance out of a slew of great ones from some of the top actors in Hollywood. His eyes conveyed the conflict happening internally inside Robert Oppenheimer. Also, I'll take a close up of Cillian's face on 70mm any day of the week. I would have like better written female characters, yet I can't deny that they are based on actual people so I'm not sure how much you can tinker with that. Also, I thought Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh were really strong in this despite their characters being fairly two dimensional. Special shout out to RDJ who hasn't been much better than his role as Lewis Stauss. It's nice to see him step out of the Iron Man suit and collaborate with a true auteur.The cinematography by Hoyt's Van Hoytema is bombastically beautifully. He was able to be showy with some of the shots without ramming it down your throat that he's one of the best in the business. 70mm IMAX film is a feast for the eyes. Loved the fission waves that would pop up every once in a while too. And I can't forget to mention Ludwig Goransson's score. Calling it now, without him this movie doesn't work completely. It relies on his score for most of the movie to help the audience keep up with the changing time periods. I'd say only about 20 minutes of this 3 hour movie doesn't have score, and my god, when it kicks, you understand why Gorranson is one of the best to do it. It's powerful, sad, and chaotic, just like the man we examine in this. Such a smart choice too to have the character be represented by a melodically falling violin that perfectly encapsulates the tone of Oppenheimer.Some minor flaws I had with this movie is that there are certain scenes that run long. Did this film really need to be three hours? Probably not, but I think if you are going to do a movie on the father of the atom bomb, you might as well. That is to say there definitely could have been some character cuts to keep it shorter. Also another thing that stood out was the last act feels long compared to the first two. I would say that the first two hours are a masterclass in biopic directing, and the last hour loses steam but still sticks the landing. Also, I'm not sure if the nudity fit the tone of the piece. Overall, if you want to see great acting coupled with a strong story and wonderful visuals, this is the movie for you. The trinity test where they test the bomb is as intense as anything Nolan has ever done, so if you are into that, you won't be disappointed. Is it my favorite Nolan film of his? No, but it is definitely one of stronger, more mature works from him that I will definitely be revisiting in the future."
"Oppenheimer..... Nolan masterworkMay be the best anxiety inducing music and claustrophobic inducing photography I ever witnessedYou feel all of the horror and the weight of guilt and emotions of Murphy , the score will hit your soul so hard like a bomb , you will be crushed under tension.Everybody waiting for bomb explode , but the bomb not the star , here , it was everything else in this movie may be the best biography movie I ever watchedThe cast did an amazing job portraying every characterI will not forget the early flickering light and atoms scenes in the beginning of the movie ,So goodI wish everyone enjoy this masterpiece as I did."
"""Oppenheimer"" is a captivating and compelling film that leaves a lasting impact. I thoroughly enjoyed it, particularly the outstanding performances that brought the characters to life. The music enhanced the overall experience, and the story was gripping from start to finish, keeping me engrossed throughout.The film's portrayal of the creator of the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer, was done with an impeccable sense of mood, capturing the complexities of his journey. However, one minor drawback for me was the abundance of characters, which at times made it a bit challenging to fully connect with each one.Despite this, ""Oppenheimer"" stands as a powerful cinematic experience, earning a solid 9/10 rating. It skillfully delves into history while showcasing exceptional performances and creating an immersive atmosphere that lingers long after the credits roll."
"Oppenheimer is composed of 95% dialogue, all of it well written by the way, and for 2h it becomes a little overwhelming. We get no chance to breathe and appreciate or take in what's just been said. Which is something I've felt throughout the movie, it's just more dialogue and more information fed to you one after the other.I really think they could have done it with 2h total duration and keep it more engaging. Spare some details and focus more on what's relevant. Some things don't add much to the story, so it becomes more biographical than anything else.That being said everything else is top notch, from the cinematography, the directing, the actors, the sets and set pieces.Will i watch it again? Probably not. I rewatched other Nolan's movies plenty of times, like Memento, Interstellar, The Prestige, Inception and Dunkirk. This one doesn't cut it for me, literally.Good movie, but it starts to feel Nolan has had his time."
If you must watch it then wait for streaming at home. Extremely long and boring. One of the worst musical scores in the history of film. The editing was poor. Truly a lame and uninteresting film. Basically as lame as the fact that I have to continue to type words so this review will have enough characters to post. If you must watch it then wait for streaming at home.

"A masterpiece in every way. Incredible storytelling, direction, cinematography, casting, acting, and musical score. Cillian deserves the award for best actor, Nolan for best director.

"Leaving the theater after seeing ""Oppenheimer,"" in the perspective of Nolan's three hours long was too short for me since ""bio-pic"" is my favorite second genre. I know this film is not for everyone to watch and it's sort of unfair when I'm not a science or history expert criticizing the deep materials itself but remember what a film is made for without criticism?The film, it's specifically about this one person, Oppenheimer, a physicist who led the Manhattan Project, during World War II, and turns out to offer more complexity. And it has more to say about the film's essential themes, the ironies when science, ambition, and political power mix than the atomic bomb itself.I let myself oppose one of Nolan's ideas and his incapable of human connections by not presenting a particular point of view from the Japanese perspective. After all, such a Nolan-typical, he always knows how to handle the emotions by showing the overwhelming flashes of destruction, and conflagrations that burn his audience to the cinders from his marvelous feat."
"Christopher Nolan did what I thought it was impossible: a 3h piece without action be intense and fast paced to the point of being almost overwhelming.I'm so impressed how fast paced Oppenheimer is. Nolan and the writers made sure simple conversation became puzzles to be solved and wars to won. You could feel Nolan's touch on how the story become a whole jigsaw in the end. It was so wholesome to watch and take it all in.And the sound direction? Insane. I cannot describe how intense the sound throughout the movie was. It played a key role in manipulating the audience emotions and expectations, leading us to climax scenes beautifully.I really recommend you to give this movie a chance if you are afraid of being bored for 3h. You won't!"
"Christopher Nolan put together yet another masterpiece. Even though it's 3 hours long unless you got XL soda you will disconnect from this world and focus on a beautifully shot and perfectly acted film. If you can, by all means go find an IMAX 70mm screen to fully appreciate what Nolan created.Cillian Murphy portrays Oppenheimer masterfully and you feel it in his eyes, I have no doubt this film will be nominated for everything and sure hope wins best picture, director, screenplay (which must have been as thick as the yellow pages), cinematography, and supporting actor would be great to have RDJ finally win an Oscar. Emily Blunt shows that she's got the range for these films, Florence Pugh was barely in this film and quite frankly even if she was included to show the womanizer side of Oppenheimer, her performance was mid at best.This is the kind of film made to be consumed in the largest screen possible and with proper cinema sound system."
"This is just Masterpiece of a movie .The acting the music 😩💖
man its just an emotion the whole movie. You don't feel the freaking 3 hours first of all. Been a HUGE fan of Christopher Nolans movies since a kid and man when does he disappoint fam.Cillian Murphy's performance in this is just right there on the top he better get the OSCAR for this man i swear .Got to watch this in early screening with 6 of my homies and im going again on saturday mid night , im going midnight because thats the time me and my friends were able to finds tickets for a screening .ITS LITERALLY FULLY BOOKED the whole weekend here in Sri lanka. Man cant wait to see this for the 2nd time now, still hyped af just as i was to watch it for the first time.Sir Christopher Nolan this is going to be your Oscar movie sir trust me its all yours.RDJ , Cillian, Florence Matt man every freaking actor just nailed it fam
And the oscar goes to ..."
"We are blessed to be alive at the same time this movie has released. This was without a doubt the most majestic movie I have ever seen, the visuals, the dialogue, the cast, the story, ALL OF IT! It really gives you the sense of urgency in the race against the world to be the first to build the bomb. Not only is it entertaining but it will change how you view things. How easy it would be for the world to be destroyed at the push of a button is in a way fascinating but at the same time terrifying. Words do not do this movie justice, go see it for yourself, this is without a doubt Christopher Nolan's best work."
"Barbie ain't got nothing on OppenheimerJust wow. That's all I can say. The practical effect are just on another level, the screenplay is weak at sometimes but for the most part excellent, the visuals are unlike anything I've seen, and the acting is just... Cillian Murphy at his best, Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr acting at a level worthy of an Oscar, and I enjoyed Pugh, Damon, Malek, to name a few. Christopher Nolan's direction is something else. He really knows what he is doing.Now, with all of that, there are few things to point out. Mostly, it is very, very long. For the most part, it is excusable, but there are some dill points. The exciting parts make up for it, but I do feel like it could have been 20 minutes shorter.If you like biopics, I think you'd like this one.NOTE: Although I enjoyed both, Oppenheimer reigns superior over Barbie."
"I couldn't write this review upon watching the film immediately because my brain still didn't recover from the experience I've had with it.I was really excited and so were everyone else before it was released, Christopher Nolan as director, the trailers, images and everything in production related to the film was huge and especially the casting members.I've never had a feeling in the cinema like the one I had after the ending hit and the credits rolled since maybe the Joker back in 2019, emotions were everywhere.This film tackles the story of one of the most important events in our history and the person behind all of it ""J. Robert Oppenheimer"", the father of the atomic bomb.It's a 3 hour journey full of non-stop and engaging dialogue that'll keep you focused and wondering in some of it trying to decipher what it means, a lot of figures of history and character names are mentioned and the interactions and relationships between them unfold.Cillian Murphy fully deserves the oscar award for best lead actor 100%, especially when it comes to the emotions in his eyes, you can clearly distinguish between different emotions in his face just by the face and eye shots that Christopher Nolan likes to do.The soundtrack and music are definitely second main protagonist after Cillian Murphy, they were some of the best I've heard in years, the way they blend in with the scenes creating astonishing scenes that give unimaginable feelings and goosebumps, It definitely carried the film in many times.The direction choices and editing in most of the scenes are out of this world and amazing.The rest of the cast were really amazing and it's hard to list each and everyone of them as they are a lot, but they were all up to par and amazing.Experiencing this on the biggest IMAX screen with a 7 star service made it 100 times better.If you ever had any doubt about what cinema is and what it could be, this film is it.I've never rated a film a 10 before because no piece of entertainment can be perfect, but I'll be honored to give my first one to Oppenheimer as I've seen nothing that would make this film experience less than that, and if there were any it's VERY VERY minor."
Nolan's best work since the release of Interstellar. It's a 3 hour long biopic/political drama about J Robert Oppenheimer and Manhattan Project from the beginning of World War 2 to the Cold War. It's a deep dive into the life and mind of Oppenheimer and the circumstances during that era. Some shots are absolutely breathtaking and I'm surprised that not a single one of them was CGI. A true technical achievement. RDJ was absolutely brilliant in every scene he was in as well as other actors. Everyone was cast perfectly. But the jewel in the crown is without a doubt Cillian Murphy. He embodied the role and stole almost every scene he was in with his sheer scene presence and body language. He's definitely getting nominated and possibly winning best actor for this one. Best movie released this year so far.
"We are in an era where the movies are good as the popularity achivied. Not a bad movie but I find it too long and with out personality; nothing that we didn't saw before. It's just like a big commercial product with the clear intention to please everyone. What was the objetive of the plot? Introducing us in the political issues? In the way of think of the protagonist? It was a love story? It was a scientific movie? Try every thing and didn't achieve at all. Not only tries so hard to please everyone but also to not offend any. Even the US that is so the thing to critize nowadays, and i mean these dumb excuses about the nuclear boms. The message is extremely simple, like ""I'm 14 and that's deep"". Looks much like a mix between Netflix soulless production and the Disney moral agenda. I have the feeling that people said they love it to sound profound. Like sushi, gives some sort of status but doesn't tastes as good as a hamburguer."
"Bottom line: Oppenheimer is a misfire and a mediocre film kept alive by strong cinematography and compelling (albeit strangely alien) performances.The entire final third of the film is an exposition-dump, some of which is comical in a mustache-twirling villain way.The Manhattan Project is an important subject for a movie, but it's emotional arc is disconnected from what the film is about (e.g., we're invited to equate Oppenheimer losing his security clearance with martyrdom-- meanwhile hundreds of thousands are killed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki). It mistakes taking itself seriously with a serious character study; it blurs the line between the ego of its protagonist and the seriousness of his effect on the world that I suspect Nolan's admiration for genius may have clouded his view of the character.Oppenheimer also suffers from classic Nolan-isms:(1) Every character has something pithy to say in all circumstances (and are ready to make call-backs to conversations 20-30 mins earlier in the film's runtime but years earlier in the timeline of the story), ultimately shattering any sense of relatability;(a) Excessively stoic characters who are over-intellectualized-- capped by acting with outstanding gravitas but somehow lacking heart;(b) Botched characterizations (Oppenheimer's girlfriend, for instance); they are meant to seem important because they are inscrutable;(c) Strong performances somehow eked from a soulless script-- compelling in that alien, is-everyone-a-sociopath way.(2) Poor sound mixing that obscures important dialogue;(3) A tendency to tell rather than show.To it's credit, there is amazing cinematography and Cillian Murphy probably delivers an Oscar-worthy performance (even as his script has him quipping his way through every scene with dialogue-- it's his eyes that get the work done). Score is excellent when it isn't overpowering dialogue.There's more I'd like to say about how the movie's perception of what is important is out-of-step with the facts presented in the narrative, and why Nolan's 'subjective' shift in all color scenes isn't sincere, but w/e you get the point."
"I'm writing this review a day after I saw the film, and I'm still in complete awe. Once the credits rolled, I was speechless due to the fact that I realized I just witnessed a cinematic masterpiece in the theaters. The movie is three hours long, but it's tied together neatly and every scene has its purpose. I'm already thinking about when I want to go see it again in theaters.I honestly don't know what the best part of the film is. The directing by Nolan, acting by Cillian Murphy and RDJ, the score, the cinematography, there's just too much to choose from. I've been listening to the score over and over again this morning because it's THAT GOOD. Murphy and RDJ should have no issues with getting Oscar nominations. I only have three 10/10's I've ever given out, Oppenheimer is definitely deserving."
"Brilliant performance from all actors especially Murphy, As I expected, the movie is a political epic, and most importantly, it is Nolan's style.The movie is not for everyone, especially for people who had high hopes And wait for explosions and things like that.You must be focused and knowledgeable about Oppenheimer's story, otherwise, you will get lost.I think Nolan rushed things in at the beginning and it felt a bit difficult.The film missed the sentiments on the main character and I didn't feel connected to him psychologically.The movie is a masterpiece, but I think it could have been better."
"I am jealous of anyone who got to see this masterpiece on an imax screen. It was simply outstanding, visual and score was phenomenal and the acting was top notch. The attention to detail was THERE, this has to be Nolan's best piece. I was not bored at any point throughout the 3hr film. I personally don't believe this is not my favourite Nolan's film (interstellar is) but this is definitely a close first. Before watching the film I would definitely would recommend to do a little research into Oppenheimers history as a lot of people did not understand the movie. Cillian murphy absolutely should get an Oscar for his performance in Oppenheimer."
"Oppenheimer is a masterpiece of cinema that explores the moral, ethical, and personal dilemmas of one of the most influential and controversial figures of the 20th century. Nolan delivers a stunning and captivating portrayal of Oppenheimer's genius, ambition, guilt, and legacy, with a brilliant performance by Cillian Murphy in the lead role. The film is not only a historical drama, but also a psychological thriller, a philosophical inquiry, and a visual spectacle. The film uses Nolan's trademark nonlinear storytelling, inventive sound design, and breathtaking cinematography to create a riveting and immersive experience that will leave you speechless."
"For the first time when Cillian Murphy remains in history for the interpretation of a real character in a Hollywood film and the second memorable character after Tommy Shelby.Christopher Nolan opens up the possibility of a new cinematic era. A Hollywood wave in which DC and Marvel films will be left behind to make way for modern films, based on real and powerful stories, with historical importance. Besides the fact that the film becomes one of Nolan's best works, J. R. Oppenheimer is found even today, the Russian-Ukrainian war and recent threats with nuclear warheads.""They won't fear it until they understand it. And they won't understand it until they've used it."" The main reason why in today's modern days people live in peace with a world order and rules against the use of atomic energy is the very fear of a mass destruction of the population. Fear, which did not exist among the countries before the Hiroshima and Nagasaki disasters.At the same time, Japan benefited from the traces of capitulation and American aid, the latter even involved in the reconstruction of the constitution and the implementation of democratic politics, becoming a main partner of the United States of America. Thus, nowadays, we can love Japan with all its brands, leaving behind the horrors and massacres committed by the Japanese during the period of imperialism."
"You must experience it, rather than reading my review.I cannot express it in words that how great this is.As an avid fan of historical dramas and biopics, I was thrilled to watch ""Oppenheimer,"" the highly anticipated film that chronicles the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the enigmatic physicist who played a pivotal role in developing the atomic bomb during World War II. Directed by the brilliant Christopher Nolan and starring an exceptional cast, the movie delivers a compelling narrative of a complex figure and the morally ambiguous era in which he lived.The film's production values are truly remarkable. Nolan's visionary direction, combined with masterful cinematography, creates a visually stunning experience. From the sweeping shots of the New Mexico desert, where the Los Alamos laboratory was set up, to the tense and atmospheric laboratories, the movie succeeds in immersing the audience in the historical context of the 1940s.Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer is nothing short of captivating. He embodies the physicist's inner turmoil, intelligence, and ambition flawlessly. Murphy's performance brilliantly captures Oppenheimer's transformation from an ambitious young scientist to a conflicted man grappling with the ethical implications of his groundbreaking work. The supporting cast, including Marion Cotillard as Katherine ""Kitty"" Puening and Michael Caine as Richard Tolman, provide stellar performances, adding depth and emotion to the narrative.The movie effectively balances the scientific aspects of the Manhattan Project with the personal and ethical dilemmas faced by the characters. It delves into Oppenheimer's complex personality, portraying him as more than just a brilliant scientist. The film highlights his relationships with colleagues, particularly his often-fraught interactions with Edward Teller (played convincingly by Tom Hardy), and his romantic entanglements, particularly his affair with Kitty Puening.One of the film's most commendable aspects is its willingness to confront the moral implications of the atomic bomb's development. It doesn't shy away from the devastating consequences of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, forcing the audience to grapple with the ethical ambiguity surrounding Oppenheimer's actions. The movie raises important questions about the cost of scientific progress and the responsibility of scientists in the face of unprecedented power."
"If you are not from a science background, you may want to stay away from it unless you have a great interest in science topics and you are used to Nolan movies. Please, don't rate it slow, fast blah blah.The movie is non-linear as you expect from Nolan and gives you sufficient information about how atomic bomb works or how a hydrogen bomb can be designed. The scientific discussions, lab culture, typical egoistic behaviour of scientist community are portrayed beautifully in this movie. Robert Downey Jr. Nailed his role of Lewis. Cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar for this role.For me, it was a perfect movie. One advice is, don't try to remember names of all the scientists. If someone is important for the story, he will be given enough screentime show that you get to know him eventually. Have an excellent ride with this excellent movie."
"One of the greatest directors of our generation - Christopher Nolan has produced yet another masterpiece. Recency bias compels me to crown Oppenheimer as the greatest Nolan film ever. Right from the casting, to the costumes, to the set, to the screenplay, to the dialogue writing, to the soundtrack, it is perfection.Cillian Murphy is beyond brilliant as J. Robert Oppenheimer and I don't think anyone else could've portrayed Oppenheimer better. RDJ reigns supreme as Luis Strauss, one of the great supporting acts in movies.Oppenheimer is Nolan's finest work, this is where Christopher Nolan comes to life. This is where Cinema comes to life.If possible, witness this once-in-a-generation film in IMAX. This is a beautiful composition of reality, science, and history.Christopher Nolan, on behalf of the entire human race, thank you."
"I took a couple of days to digest three hours of slow burn drama so here we are, ready to blast an impossibly objective review. Let's begin with the obvious: this is 100% Nolaned; the script is clean and meticulous; Robert Downey Jr stands out for best acting followed by Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt; Matt Demon isn't credible; the music is too insidious; the visuals and the story itself aren't worthy of a big screen. Now that the most evident is dissected, here is the trick. The movie portraits an American patriot that oscillates between pride and guilt with enough elements to pull in both directions simultaneously. And when you think the script was a straight line without twists (and you would be right), subplots emerge to at least complete three hours of dialogues with emoted tension and resolution in the life of a scientist, the father of the atomic bomb, turned both monster and hero. My biggest turn off is that he story and the film deserve two hours - not three."
"Do not waste your time, it's like skurls have put a face of Nolan, and made a film !!! There is no other explanation that he needed so much publicity than a unique storytelling, as he often does.Same as Wes Anderson lost it with ""The French Dispatch"" last year and now the ""Asteroid City"" Nolan has lost it too !! There is no creativity, the touch of Nolan I expected !!I know some people hate ""Tenet"" but I am amazed with the concept and how they make it possible, but this film, which he's been calling his dream project, is a disaster !!He's good with conceptual storytelling, otherwise we have the same film in bollywood - Rocketry: The Nambi Effect and two seasons of Rocket Boys !!"
"Despite Oppenheimer's patchy reputation, Nolan has put forward a reasonably fair assessment in this day and age. In the storyline, Louis Strauss acted as a counterweight to the heroic side of the father of the atomic bomb, and went on to reveal in a one-liner the possibility of a malicious side of the calculating physicist. What undergirds the complexity of the assessment harks back to a witty remark made by Albert Einstein, accompanied by a few amazing shots, that will make things 'click' into place. Though I also lament that nothing more comes out of the Prometheus analogy.I do notice the back-and-forth switching between B&O and coloured clips which sets apart, of course, the chronology and also reinstates the mood change. This kind of nudge is helpful. It keeps me aware of the sorry condition that the aspect ratio 1.43:1 is not available where I am, for me to enjoy the enhanced white-hot scene. Pity.To be sure, physicists are smart and most are funny in person like Richard Feynmann. However, some brilliantly written dialogues strike me as out-of-character. Even the entourage of Strauss could drop some vitriolic lines. Someone should have toned it down, not overshoot."
"21st July. First day first showAfter finishing TENET, Nolan had said that he's working on the genre of horror. If only people knew what horror he was talking about. The story was shown in a great detailed way, it spans over a few decades of events. Makes sense why it's 3 hours long. After seeing the fast paced nature of TENET. Oppenheimer felt calming, like a thunderstorm before dawn, leaving the sweet smell of wet Earth.But boy was it dark. And Cillian Killed it. Nolan is like the kid with a camera, putting the giant IMAX lens on the very face of the actors. It's a very intimate storytelling. It's not grand, it felt very personal. A story exploring the core of one of the biggest events in the history of the world.Don't listen to the morons who are calling it as boring. Watch it yourselfScreenplay - 10/10
Sound - 9/10
Pacing - 10/10
Direction - Need I say?Einstein - mc^2 / 10."
"For all you attention-deficit sheep, this is NOT a BOOM-BOOM story about the bomb, it is about the life of the man who created it. And yes, it is three hours long. If this is too much for your cranial bandwidth, go watch Die Hard. Cilian Murphy did an OUTSTANDING job playing a brilliant but tortured physicist. Emily Blunt was amazing as always especially in her testimony on her husband's behalf. A well-told story that takes its time. All-star cast. Gary Oldman makes a brief but important appearance as the narcissistic psychopath war criminal Truman who called Oppenheimer a 'crybaby' for having moral conflicts about designing an instrument that murdered over a quarter of a million innocent human beings. I do wish there would have been much more of a focus on the criminal devastation inflicted upon the people of Japan. Also, deduction for the sex and nudity - WHY do movies do this? Do people enjoy watching depicted sex scenes? If so, why not more scenes of people sitting on toilets? Ridiculous and unnecessary. But all in all a great story. Murphy absolutely deserves an Oscar for this one."
"After reading the reviews prior to seeing the film, it felt as if this flick has divided cinema-goers. Ok, let's deal with the obvious - cast, cinematography and art of telling a story well are very much order of the day, but did it need to be 3hr sitting, probably not.You'd be hard pushed to find a fault with the build but as many have pointed out, the bio pic is more than events of WW2, it questions the fabric of the human soul, morals and ethics along with political and professional upmanship.All in all a super film that proved to be a fascinating watch. Nolan deliverers the goods again."
"I rated it 9 as this movie imfao it's not like the type of movies of Christopher Nolan that we used to see.In this movie as a person who know the story of Oppenheimer so in the movie I really didn't see anything that attracts me to the events as I really know every step that's coming in the movie however this doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy the cinematography or the filming but tbh I wanted something that attracts me like all Christopher Nolan movies.And about the cast and the acting I enjoyed watching Cillian Murphy doing Oppenheimer Character and the staff of scientists with him
they were quite good."
"This is the first movie which I am watching in theatres. This is just amazing from starting with black and white colour and then to brightfull this movie has so much to tell. The story tell, build up, different paces, intensed scenes and situation. NOLAN did a great grear job. I was so hyped up for this movie and watched the first day first show and i t was worth it. We all know nolan's cinematography and bgm sound score was so it. My eyes were glued to it. I have enjoyed the movie very much felt the tension between the characters and the cast did such a such a great job Cillian Murphy, RDJ' Emily blunt and Matt Damon I love you all. YOU MADE MY DAY."
"When the credits began to roll, I was speechless. An incredibly fast paced and stressful 3 hours flew by in what felt like an episode of television. I felt almost a sour taste in my mouth, and wanted to go curl up in a ball under my covers. My heart was still racing and mentally I was exhausted. A lot of my hope was gone. Still, my main thought was ""unbelievable. I have just witnessed Nolan's masterpiece."" Long has Nolan been a director I admire for his technical accuracy, complex topics, and what he reveals about humanity. This film was no different than his previous films in attention to soundtrack, visual affects, and filmography. Without the use of a big twist like in inception and the prestige, he still left a meaningful end impact.Now, to address the title as to why it won't be appreciated. Like any semi-causal moviegoer, I instantly went to the reviews to see how others felt. Large criticisms were the dialogues were too complex, the trinity test too small, and overall a boring film. I chalk those reviews up to the type of people who watch a movie for only a dopamine release. I say that not in a pretentious way, but in a way as to why I thought this film beats the dark knight or other films. All I wanted to do after this film was debate and read more about this obviously flawed yet important man. The world I have lives in was challenged and I no longer felt as safe as before. This was marketed as a blockbuster must see, and while that is true that everyone should watch it for its obvious important matter, the satisfaction a moviegoer will derive is lessened if they are not ready to be confused and want to learn more after.If you want an action movie, this is not for you. If you want a quick flick, I would definitely not recommend this. If you want to be challenged and stressed in ways that movies such as Inception, The prestige, Fight Club, Whiplash, and many more, then I couldn't recommend this movie more. I watched in UltraAVX and just bought weekend tickets for IMAX."
"To kick things off ! I have to say the visuals and the storyline was very well combined ! I was very well impressed with some of the performances and in particular Emily Blunt Cillian Murphy and most importantly the support actors who had their moment to shine through this movie.They were moments were you feel like it's going to explode but left with an open ended line wondering what's next ! Nevertheless, it was encouraging to see Nolan putting a factual output of Oppenheimer's character and bringing the audience into the shoes of the character. Despite this,the last hour really dragged a bit longer than it should of been but can't take way another masterclass from Nolan !!"
"After making a semi pilgrimage to watch this film in one of the handful of IMAX theaters in California, my main takeaway is frustration. Way too much of the dialogue is drowned out by background noise. Struggling to make sense of what characters are saying is not my idea of a good time. The director appears to have fallen in love with this technique. While he and ""critics"" verbally put an artistic spin on it, I truly believe there's nothing more to it than a deep seated power complex. It really knocked the enjoyment down several pegs for me. So much going for this film and yet my lasting takeaway is annoyance."
"Oppenheimer is Nolan's latest and on the top of my must see list this year (there aren't many) needless to say it's not what I wanted.The movies boring plain and simple, there are only a handful of moments that Nolan actually captured what I was wanting to see and in a 3hr movie it's few and far between.I'd be singing a different tune had the movie ended when Oppe was giving his speech and imagining them being nuked it seemed like the perfect ending to it...but no it drags for another what seemed like an hour of court room but not court room drama it wasn't interesting.Didn't like any of the characters which makes it difficult to watch and the writing/acting was pretty subpar. So much trying to get an Oscar overacting. Cillian was good in the role nothing too memorable to rave though.It just got to the point of what's the point? Would've been a better movie had it been more focused on the building of the nuke, Hiroshima, the aftermath and moral dilemma but it focuses more on the issues with Strauss, the government, his wives and sabotaging one's career and reputation just got boring.The movie also gets loud at random points as if it's trying to make the movie more engaging than it is or to wake the audience from its slumber.The nuke scene was poorly shot. Didn't seem like much of an explosion either could've been better.Overall Oppenheimer is Oppenhyped it doesn't live up."
"The best among all of Christopher Nolan movies so far. An Historical events told in a most gripping ways, which only he can do. Such an overwhelming cast, worth the story and characters. Cillian Murphy acting as Dr Robert Oppenheimer is beyond words. He is surely getting nominated for Oscars along with Christopher Nolan and others for most of the major categories. Cinematography and sound is another +++.Three phases of story told simultaneously, interwoven so well it will keep you fully engaged. Equally mesmerizing is the interrogation and debates after the Japan bombing. Watch it on iMax screen for maximum fun. Loved it thoroughly."
"I just got back from the cinema and I have to say, the hype is real. What a complete masterpiece of a film. Cilian Murphy is fantastic, but I already knew that. I think it's RDJ's performance that is absolutely magnificent and beyond anything I thought he was capable of. This isn't so much a typical Nolan film, like Interstellar, Inception or Tenet. It is much more a political thriller. It still has great cinematics and audio, but it goes a lot deeper into the psychology of the characters, especially Oppenheimer himself, than characters in other Nolan films. The ensemble of A-list actors in support roles in the film is impressive and all delivered good to great performances, including Matt Damon, an otherwise somewhat one dimensional actor in my opinion. No film is perfect, but with Oppenheimer Chris Nolan is getting very close to achieving that."
Interstellar was the first movie I saw of Nolan and since then I fell in love with his work and watched his every movie. I was waiting for Oppenheimer since 8-9 months and I was not disappointed the movie was worth every penny the cinematics and the amazing sound quality will make you fall in love with Nolan again and the way he tells the story is truly amazing. This a movie which deserves to be seen only in cinemas the small screen will not to justice to this masterpiece. After the interval the movie becomes so interesting that you'll be sitting on the edge of your seat. I can't wait for Nolan's next movie now and I wish he makes thousand more movies.
"An unprecedented piece of cinema, that melds Christopher Nolan's distinctive style of time-crossing narratives, snappy editing, and brief yet impactful dialogues with a mesmerizing blend of biopic and political rivalry elements.The film brilliantly delves into the depths of Oppenheimer's psyche, skillfully interweaving his psychological struggles with breathtaking scenes of the quantum realm and awe-inspiring atomic explosions. Through these captivating visuals, we gain unparalleled insight into Oppenheimer's mood and state of mind, creating a feeling of exploration that seems incomprehensible to describe.While the exploration of Oppenheimer's psyche is a true marvel, the film occasionally loses its footing as it delves into the realm of non-fiction. The rapid succession of scenes and a multitude of characters introduced without context can, at times, create a sense of overwhelming speed that might not have been the director's intention.Nevertheless, the movie's brilliance shines through in powerful moments that showcase its true potential. For instance, a poignant speech scene brilliantly contrasts imagined screams with real laughter, instilling a palpable sense of unease in the audience. Furthermore, intense interrogations set against a vibrating background add to the film's tension, creating an experience akin to witnessing a real nuclear bomb about to explode within the cinema.Complementing the film's visual brilliance is a stellar soundtrack crafted by Ludwig. While not Hans Zimmer, Ludwig's work aptly captures both gentleness and intensity, enhancing the overall cinematic experience.At its core, the movie revolves around the profound idea of Oppenheimer's responsibility for igniting the chain of events that could have led to the world's demise, all while grappling with the weight of his own conscience. The exploration of Oppenheimer's character is undoubtedly the film's strongest aspect, overshadowing the less cohesive inclusion of political scenes and the rivalry with Strauss. By focusing more on Oppenheimer's journey, the movie would undoubtedly reach even greater heights of excellence."
"We had the chance to see it in imax in 70 mm, what a great experience. For entire 3 hours you are immersed into this film. The story telling and to cinematography is beyond approach.You want to bring your a game when you're at this movie. It goes back-and-forth in time and weaves an incredible story which is both fascinating and entertaining while being educational and informative.It's one of those movies where you would want to go back and watch a second time after you've had some more time to digested and to do your own research.So many things that surprise and amaze you and exposes the horrible upside of American history. Such a timely movie considering the current events."
"It was perfect. Perfect. Everything, to the last minute detail. Nolan was not kidding when he said that the movie was going to be bomb (literally).The screenplay and the cast selection, the writing, the delivery, the shooting. No words. I believe that there isn't any other movie that can compete with the craze and the movie itself. The only downside is that you can loose track of the movie if you don't stay focused.Seeing Robert Downey JR after endgame was really a sight for sore eyes, and the chemistry between all of the characters was something unreal!Summing it up, this is definitely a must watch along with Barbie (Oppenheimer better)."
"Amazing movie, the best I have seen this year. Nolan keeps high class. I think Oppenheimer will win at least 6 Oscars in 2024. Top class actors, even in episodes - like Gary Oldman, Matt Modine, Casey Affleck, etc. Cillian Murphy played his best role and deserves Oscar. Like Robert Dawney Jr. - his play was outstanding. Christopher Nolan deserves his oscar too. Every film detail is perfect. Here is my opinion regarding Oscars: Best actor - Cillian Murphy, Supporting actor - Robert Dawney Jr., Best directing - Christopher Nolan, Best Picture - Oppenheimer, Best original screenplay - Oppenheimer, Best film editing - Oppenheimer."
"I am going to start with the only negative things. This film has a high chance of not convincing a huge amount of people. Probably, this isn´t going to be Nolan´s best film mainly because it is a ""simmered film"", three hours long and it can be tedious sometimes. But there is one thing for sure. If you are a cinema lover, you are going to enjoy this masterpiece. The plot, the characters, the explosion.... everything is so well done and there is not one, but two candidates for the oscar: Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. It is unbelivable how they nail their characters in such an special way.My advice is to go to the cinema, buy some popcorns and enjoy this ""3 hours work of art""."
"I went with my adult kids and we all had the same reaction. The movie was not what we were expecting. The morning of the viewing i was watching the news and they were saying ""the best movie of the year"" and a ""perfect movie"" and ""you must see it in IMAX"".. None of that was close to being true. While an informative movie on Oppenheimer's personal life , not a lot on the inside story of the making of the bomb or the science behind it . Mostly drama about whether or not he had communist affiliations. IMAX was completely useless, there was no great action scenes or great sounds or music. I""m sorry but i don't understand all the 10's, whatever happened to a 10 meaning perfection."
"I believe that we must distinguish the film and the story. The events that inspired this movie are tremendously important and fascinating; but the film itself is a fiasco. First, it is far too long. The first half is a classic portrait of a scientist working on a project. It has nothing outstanding from a cinematic point of view. I had to wait an hour and a half before seeing anything inspired and inspiring. Then, there's the sound: the constant presence of music or sound effects drowns the dialogues and is really, really irritating, while serving a presumably dramatic purpose. The camera work is shallow and uninspired, at best: definitely not what one would expect in a film presented as a great piece of cinema. Fortunately, the actors do a first-class job throughout all this mediocrity.Overall, Oppenheimer fell far below my expectations. This story deserved a much more subtle approach."
"Although I'm not traditionally a fan of films that tell the story of historical events, Oppenheimer was a pleasant surprise as it mixed captivating storytelling with superb acting to tell a story that questions not only the mortally of larger issues but your own morals too, the visual effects are top notch and the sound effects match, however, what stops it being a 10 for me is a lack of a captivating soundtrack and whilst not a bad soundtrack by any means, for me, there's only 1 or 2 stand out tracks that really got my attention, Oppenheimer is a film that is captivated by stellar individual perfeomanfes and superb chemistry between its characters and whilst it's probably everyone's cup of tea but definitely worth the watch."
"The film's narrative structure exhibits a seamless blend of historical accuracy and artistic interpretation, captivating audiences with its gripping storyline and compelling character portrayals. Through meticulous attention to detail, the production team brings to life the era's ambiance, immersing viewers in the 1940s scientific and political landscape.With awe-inspiring cinematography and an evocative musical score, the movie succeeds in heightening emotions and adding depth to pivotal moments of Oppenheimer's life. The depiction of the Manhattan Project's challenges and ethical implications is thought-provoking, leaving the audience with a profound sense of contemplation.The supporting cast delivers exceptional performances, complementing the lead's portrayal of Oppenheimer. Their chemistry adds layers of authenticity to the film, evoking empathy and understanding of the human elements in this crucial period of history.As the story unfolds, ""Oppenheimer"" also offers subtle insights into the broader sociopolitical context of the time, reflecting on the consequences of scientific innovation and the far-reaching impact of nuclear technology. This profound exploration makes the film not just a biographical drama but also a poignant commentary on humanity's capacity for both ingenuity and destruction.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic tour de force that masterfully captures the essence of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life and the ethical conundrums he faced. With its stellar performances, breathtaking visuals, and intellectual depth, the film resonates deeply, leaving a lasting impression on audiences. This thought-provoking portrayal of a brilliant but conflicted mind cements ""Oppenheimer"" as a cinematic gem and a must-watch for history enthusiasts and film aficionados alike."
"Oppenheimer was overall fantastic! My brief, non-spoiler review:It's about Robert Oppenheimer as a person and the journey he experienced in the development and usage of the atomic bomb. The film explores Oppenheimer's complicated personal life, extreme risks with the discussion around the usage of a bomb, his fears of those risks, the PTSD he experienced post-development/bombing, the complicated relationships he had with his colleagues, and misinterpretations that often took place during the Communist era.The story is told through his eyes and we experience his feelings, basically.Some have considered this to be a horror film: no, not really. It does have a few jumpscares, but they are Oppenheimer's PTSD.The film is a bit long for my liking, but that's just me. Sound design is flawless and will blow you away. The soundtrack is crazy good.This movie is Rated R so if you can handle the content but moreover, appreciate how it relates to the character, you'll likely enjoy this movie. This will be a Blu-ray on my shelf for sure."
"To begin with, Robert J Oppenheimer, the physicist who led the Manhattan Project, famously quoted the Bhagavad Gita after witnessing the first successful nuclear explosion at the Trinity test site in Los Alamos New Mexico. He said, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"". Intentionally or unintentionally, he was just doing his karma, but the consequences were enormous as we have encountered in the past and possibly will in the future.The movie is more about the political affairs of Oppenheimer. The science behind the nuclear fission is not covered in great detail, but moral dilemma experienced by him post invention and aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and his concern for the planet gives the moves a closure.Murphy's acting is top notch. Nolan's direction is excellent, as always. This is Nolan's first biopic and he did the best work yet! It's a brilliant movie making, undoubtedly, especially given Nolan's top notch screenplay and direction, coupled with the IMAX cameras that give the viewer the best experience when watched on the biggest screen possible.There are many references to quantum physics and a brief interaction of Oppenheimer with Einstein. A major part of the movie goes into the investigation of Oppenheimer's involvement in conspiracy to spy, and being a communist, which was more of a political will.The basic idea and usage of powerful weapons like Brahmastra were mentioned in the Indian scriptures Ramayana and Mahabharatha, which gives the indication that the WMD might have been invented and used since antiquity. They might have already realized the power lying within each atom and used it for the good and seen it as the revelation of divine power then as opposed to the plutonium-239 and uranium-235 isotopes be used for evil purposes in this age.Overall, it's a must watch for all science and movie buffs!"
"Ok, so this movie is obviously long af! It could have easily been summed up within 2 hours. With that said, the best way I can describe it is, you know those conference meetings where everyone is sitting around the table and the one dude doesn't know how to stfu. Oppenheimer is that conference meeting you're stuck in.With that said, the acting is excellent. Robert Downey Jr, Josh Hartnett, and Cillian Murphy were my favorites. Josh Hartnett made me do triple takes because I couldn't believe how evolved he was. The movie itself needed to be more spicy.. more, exciting. Now there was one scene that people got offended over but it's 2023, what are people NOT offended over anymore? The movie itself was about a 5.5 but I'm giving it an 8 because I could listen to Cillian Murphy talk all day. I think people expected to see an explosion and aftermath but this movie isn't an action movie. We are in the brain of Oppenheimer. We are in his story.But if you don't like long movies this definitely isn't for you. It's a whole lot of talking. Oh and spoiler alert.... they do show some boobies so I guess that was a little spicy. :P."
"If Christopher Nolan had died today, this would be his magnum opus.I had the pleasure of viewing Oppenheimer on a film screening. While not on an Imax Film screening, it was a 5 perf 70mm screen. If you have the opportunity to see this movie on ANY film medium, please do so.The film shows great respect to it's viewers, throwing you straight into the action. It hooks you in so easily. The performances are some of the best performances I have ever seen. The film is 3 hours long, yet keeps you entranced in it's ever-growing and progressing plot. Without revealing many spoilers, I can say the following.This is Christopher Nolan's best film. It's a collaboration to do something new, to make a bio-pic, and to tell a story which just hasn't been told before with a combined effort and learning from all of his past.If you have the chance to see Oppenheimer, do so. If it means staying up until 1 in the morning, do so. It is a film which will keep itself in your mind. It is addictive."
"Real masterpiece. I knew this movie will be a good one, but I didn't expect this... I was felling stress and pressure on my body for 3 hours. For some moments I was forgetting that I'm sitting in cinema and watching a movie. Beautiful experience. Cillian Murphy acting was on top level. I watched thousands of movies in my life, but I never experienced this strange feeling that I was feeling after leaving cinema. This film is telling us a really important story that we shouldn't ever forget. A story about events that happened not so long ago. Story which changed a entire world. I'm waiting for an Oscar for Cillian."
"First off, as a huge Nolan fan, I admit I have a bit of a bias towards his films. Oppenheimer delivered in a lot of areas as expected, but let down in a few areas as well.The cinematography was good, although some may say the footage was out of focus a lot. While this is true, it was intentional, and anyone watching the movie should be able to recognize that. Nolan noticeably directed to have wider angle lenses used, and higher apertures for a lot of the shots (which isn't typical of him). It was definitely refreshing to see.The usage of montage is plentiful throughout the film, and sort of expected (with how Nolan's movies have always been art/film theory oriented, but especially lately). While he took some new risks doing shallow focus and montage work, I think it fits the film quite well (the depth of field specifically) adding to the ""feel"" of the film.Set design, and the use to over-expose in some scenes was sort of a stroke of genius. Without going too far into detail, it added to the overarching feeling Oppenheimer has throughout the film.My disappointment comes from the two sex scenes in the film and the nuclear explosion. It's really not like Nolan to include scenes that don't add to the story or leave stale moments, so seeing this was a complete shock to me. After studying his films for many years, I feel almost like it was something he was paid off to do, which isn't something I've ever seen from Nolan, (even when had less creative control doing the Batman trilogy). The nuclear explosion was something expected honestly, as Nolan prefers Special Effects over Visual Effects, but in this case, using some CG would have sold the nuclear test scene way better. I felt like it built up to nothing really. Chills down my spine with the amazing score and visuals, all for nothing really.Finally, the script was incredibly impressive and DID NOT disappoint for a Nolan film. An emotional and powerful message, while still being (to the best of my nerdy nuclear physicist knowledge) incredibly historically accurate.Overall, the film felt like an open door into the past, showing the journey of one of the most influential and genius minds of all time. While I feel it would have been really awesome to hear a fact like ""only 1.38% of the Uranium in the bomb went off when it exploded in Hiroshima,"" they did include facts like atmospheric ignition and such, so Nolan did accomplish the goal of making the film accurate and believable. The visuals and audio were stunning as always, and the script blew me away (literally). I'm impressed with the film, but was left slightly disappointed with some things. Definitely not Nolan's best film, but better than any film of the past few years. 8.3/10."
"Few inventions throughout the history of mankind have been of more consequence than the creation of the nuclear bomb. Robert Oppenheimer is one of few men who single-handedly changed the course of history. This film did a great justice to his legacy.Christopher Nolan masterfully throws you into the world of 1940s theoretical physics and the lives of these incredibly brilliant scientists, under the backdrop of the most important contest of all time - the race to build the atom bomb. Oppenheimer leading America, Heisenberg leading Germany. For all of the moral dilemmas explored in the film, the bottom line is that if America didn't succeed, our adversaries very well would have. Dropping Little Boy and Fat Man on Japan may have killed hundreds of thousands, but Oppenheimer's work and campaigning may have saved millions and billions over the course of time.The historical accuracy was incredible, and it was electrifying to see the portrayal of these great minds of science and the choices they were faced with. From the start of the movie, we see Oppenheimer portrayed as a savant that sees a dimension of the world out of reach to the common man, reminding me of John Nash in A Beautiful Mind.We see the massive investment that went into the Manhattan project, and how much freedom and power FDR gave in the form of a blank check to these scientists, trusting in their process - Hitler, on the other hand, never had the same conviction or investment on the German side. Cillian Murphy gave an Academy award winning performance as the lead role, and was supported by countless terrific performances by other A-list actors.I am astounded by the amount of effort Nolan invested into the history and science of this film, while still keeping the pace captivating and thrilling. Really outstanding movie, and a refreshing break from the many action-packed, superhero type of movies that drive the box office today. I hope there will be more blockbuster films like this in the future."
"To be honest I think it was highly overrated. I had high expectations about this movie reading all the positive reviews. The beginning of the movie was rather slow and way to much dialogue. After they started to preparate the bomb the movie became a bit more decent. The acting was really good nothing bad to say on that part but the movie itself wasn't it for me... Understandable if Murphy gets an Oscar for this movie since I can't think of any others at the moment to get it for a leader role, his acting was high class. Maybe if your an American then you feel a bit more interested to see it from different perspectives but as an European I wasn't really feeling it."
"I'm a big fan of Nolan. I watched all his movies. Here, he missed the ball completely.The quote from the film in the title of my review tells everything about where the director missed. There are 3 movies in one: about scientific research to create a weapon of mass destruction, about the episode an attempt at persecuting Oppenheimer during McCarthy ere for Communist connections and about the personal life of Oppenheimer. All 3 story lines get scrambled together and in the end none of them very convincing. The wonderful setting and delivery of the nuclear research story was somehow not complete with only partial coverage of the moral position that Oppenheimer had about dropping of the bombs on Japan. Was it necessary to save thousands of the US lives? It's muddled in the movie. The majority of the film is about power machinations in regard to Oppenheimer's security clearance. There's a lot of hustle and bustle but in end it's just not very compelling as a story about the father of atomic bomb. Yes, we know about the Red Scare and the insanity that was going on then with persecution of people who made great contributions in the art and science in America. But I do not feel that it added anything into the Oppenheimer story. His personal life story was not presented in a interesting way as well. I looked at my watch several times during the 3 hours and left the theatre very dissapointed."
"This movie is for audience can always know about it. There some good stuff and more, so we can see about the good movie. I know this movie has good things or bad things, which it is the good thing about the project and a lot stuff. So i did great for the movie. Always know this movie, but there's no problem unless the audience are did good or awesome. Oppenheimer is the good movie. But there's don't allow at school only cuz it is for Mature audience. The sexuality and nudity are good and moderate. Which there's no full frontal nudity or any graphic. Don't worry it also may profanity are good. :)"
"Excellent film, multilayered as another reviewer put it. I knew the story so the way it moved about from Oppenheimer's early life, the Manhattan Project, his security appeal and the Strauss confirmation hearing was known to me. However that might have been confusing to those who don't know the story. Given where Christopher Nolan is from I was surprised that the huge contribution British and Canadian scientists, among other non-Americans, seemed only to be represented by one of the British delegation who is revealed as a Soviet spy. That's the sort of thing that makes Americans think they ivented everything or won every war by themselves."
"Oppenheimer is one of the best movies I've ever seen the amazing cast matched with the incredible pacing, writing, cinematography just works like clockwork, I do think the first half is better than the second half mostly because Christopher Nolan is just better with science and the second half of the film ( the aftermath of trinity ) is just mostly politics and Oppenheimer being questioned. But the film is still awesome, Christopher Nolan never fails to impress me just like he did in interstellar, inception, and the prestige. The score was phenomenal but I really wish it had that Hans Zimmer touch to it especially when they tested trinity."
"This movie is so sad and brutal and tragic and emotional and ridiculously magical.I really don't know from where to start. This is a piece of art that you wish to live once in your life. Cillian was Oppenheimer. He got his soul cause that was beyond acting for sure.Robert DJ? He is dumb to lock himself in that iron man suit. The man just produced sick, sick....sick performance. The black-and-white cinematography with his performance, facial expressions, his voice ... oh my darling god.Nolan, we own you so much on your work. You are the star. You are the star of all stars. We are audiences of your excellence.I got my beautiful weekend served properly ... and I love you all!"
"Initially, the prospect of enduring a 3-hour film raised doubts within me, contemplating how I could possibly remain engaged for such an extended duration. However, my uncertainty was swiftly dispelled.Directed and written by the renowned Christopher Nolan, the mastermind behind iconic films like ""The Dark Knight trilogy,"" ""Inception,"" ""Interstellar,"" and ""Dunkirk,"" ""Oppenheimer"" stands as yet another testament to Nolan's filmmaking expertise.This weekend, Cinephiles were in for a treat as two highly-anticipated films, ""Oppenheimer"" and ""Barbie,"" marked their much-awaited debut at the box office.""Oppenheimer"" has emerged as a remarkable biographical thriller, leaving audiences deeply engaged and intellectually stimulated throughout its ambitious 3-hour runtime.Based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, brilliantly portrayed by the versatile and talented Cillian Murphy.Sharing the screen with Murphy are powerhouse actors Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh.Upon entering the theater, viewers are immediately made aware that ""Oppenheimer"" demands their undivided attention.The film treats its audience with great respect, offering intelligent storytelling that requires one's wits and fully switched-on brain.Nolan masterfully crafts a dense and layered screenplay which fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace.The cinematography in ""Oppenheimer"" is visually arresting, presenting a stark and spare aesthetic while occasionally bursting with vivid and luscious colors, especially during scenes featuring the captivating Florence Pugh.The score, though beautiful at times, largely contributes to the film's pervasive sense of anxiety and oppression, perfectly complementing the relentless pacing that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats.While the 3-hour runtime might seem daunting to some, ""Oppenheimer"" surprisingly flies by.It is a must watch. I rate it 9 out of 10. Awesome."
"Director: Christopher Nolan
Starring: Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon
Running time: 180 minutesOppenheimer is the latest in the recent trend in Hollywood for biopics, but it goes well beyond following this memetic formula in its telling of this very powerful and important story of the life and times of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer was a theoretical physicist and is often dubbed the ""father of the atomic bomb"" and the film traces a swift overview of Oppenheimer's life, keeping a strong focus on the invention of the bomb itself and the resulting aftermath. Many biopics that come out these days are somewhat unfocused attempts to compress an entire life story into a film with seemingly little point in doing so, apart from the sheer enjoyment of indulging in an entertaining life story, but with this film, director Christopher Nolan keeps a precise focus to the story and the movie plays with an intense dramatic drive that keeps you on the edge of your seat.The intensity is a result of the time period in which it is set. Most of the film plays out in the wartime years of the 1940s, in the race to beat the axis powers in coming up with an atomic weapon. This would suggest that the film is a war movie, but it is the tension between war and scientific advancement that gives the movie its true tension. Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer is a man captivated by the boundless possibilities of science and the movie follows his story, delving into his work in science and his ties with the war and the wider politics of the time."
"I understand the critics, yet I believe this was an excellent movie.Here's why:
Though probably not Nolan's best work, it met many peoples' expectations. The length of the movie was acceptable, due to the fact that it needs a certain build up of tension before the initial explosion. The audience gets a glimpse into Oppenheimer's life, career and associates, which helps to understand the consequences that follow after Oppenheimer realizes what he has brought to humanity.From a cinematic perspective, there were a lot of beautiful shots, accompanied by the remarkable visuals that one does not see so often in films. Other than that, I really appreciated the little details that ended up tying everything altogether, such as the stomping of the feet that came up quite a few times visually and auditory.Speaking of auditory material, though Hans Zimmer did not contribute to Nolan's work this time, Ludwig Göransson did an incredible job. The music and the sound effects did not fail in building up tension and catching the audience's attention. A typical emphasis in Nolan's films.Last point, the cast was great with many familiar faces I'd never think I'd see on a set together, and most importantly, Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Did, as always, an incredible job.A true film of this era, that experiments, and succeeds in reaching its expectations. Bravo."
"This film is a biopic of the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a nuclear physicist, during the period of time he spearheaded the development of the atomic bomb. It deals with not only the project and its impact on the lives of Robert and others, but also with the time period after, when the government trials him.I have to give credit to Nolan. I was seriously expecting to be antsy and feel this run time (given the minimal to no action), but I was compelled for the three hour runtime. The script is written in masterful fashion, jumping between time periods, leaving key clues and context unanswered until later, and giving a real weight and importance to every conversation. The manner in which the story unfolds is unconventional and polished - Nolan's ability to tell a riveting and intelligent story stays unrivalled. Apart from the script, I loved the little stylistic touches that embellish the entire film. During close ups of Oppenheimer, we often see intentional focus racking/ breathing, really showing us his unstable and conflicted mental state, like he is ready to collapse due to the pressure. Apart from this almost every scene where a face is involved, there is a subtle zoom happening, drawing me in, making it feel interesting. The sound design is superb, with its jarringly loud explosions, beautiful score and a plethora of subjective, expressive sounds which really add to scenes. Every single scene Oppenheimer is in, there is light contrast on his face, one side brighter, one darker. The lighting is never flattering, making him appear troubled, weathered and rugged.I really wish I did some mild research beforehand. I am extremely ignorant on this man and even this section of history, so I found some sections a bit confusing. I was trying to take in the general scene composition, but also piece together what is happening and why. I'm specifically talking about the last section of the movie where the court and interrogations take centre stage. My mind was constantly running in the background because I didn't understand why Oppenheimer was being tried, and by who exactly. If I had a bit of context beforehand, I would have appreciated this section so much more.That isn't really a complaint, as I could have easily missed a piece of dialogue or detail, so here are my complaints. The film felt a little convoluted. It throws enough minor characters at you to fill a warehouse, and I was constantly taken out of the movie trying to remind myself who a character is, what their importance is, and where we'd last seen them. The final 30 mins or so, where we constantly jump from Downys black and white scenes to Oppenheimers interrogation room - it lost me. The issue is with a film this dense, where every single line and detail matters, is becoming confused snowballs extremely quickly as events and conversations carry on. Or maybe its just me... I felt like the Los Alamos section of the film was the pinnacle, with tightly paced scenes and conversations, high intensity and intrigue, and an explosion that was technically and stylistically executed to what I'd consider perfection. The last hour of the movie I felt dragged, and it sort of felt like a slow death of my interest until the credits rolled.Overall, Oppenheimer is a layered character piece, where Nolan weaves an intelligent story of inward and outer destruction, burden and government deceit. Its visuals and sound compliment the script exceptionally, but some sections feel like they drag behind others."
"I enjoyed this movie for the first half or so, then I realized I was only halfway through the movie. The first thirty minutes or so had some interesting visuals but the directing style seemed to fall flatter as the movie dragged on. I was pretty interested in the process of them figuring out how to make the bomb and the physics of it all, and how that all came together. That was interesting but they included a few other aspects to the movie which weren't very interesting and I eventually got lost in some of that dialogue. It'd be fine to include some about Oppenheimer's personal life and all the politics that occurred but they didn't have to make a whole movie's worth of it. The movie could easily have been two hours instead of three.I appreciated that they used practical effects to show the test bomb, that was an entertaining section of the movie but personally I didn't think it looked like an atom bomb going off. It just looked like a large regular explosion which is what it was. You could see the details of the flames. They tried to force a perspective to make it look a lot bigger than it was but if you know what flames look like and you've seen video of a nuclear explosion before you know that this was not one of those. It was a really cool explosion but you could easily tell that it was not a nuclear blast.The acting was good. I didn't quite understand exactly what position Lewis Strauss was in and how/why he became so involved.It had me engaged for a good hour or so but by the two and a half hour mark I was ready to leave the theater."
"Absolutely adore Nolan's movies and had high expectations. Interstellar is my favorite movie of all time. That being said I was quite disappointed with this one.I knew this was going to be a biographical film but I didn't expect it to be so boring. Honestly it just lags so much and doesn't quite pick up pace as I hoped it would...it just goes on and on...an on.We are bombarded with powerful sounds every so often, which I guess is to keep us from falling asleep as nothing really is going on. Felt so exhausted two hours in and I couldn't wait for it to be over.Obviously great acting by the main cast, but I did not feel connected or attached to any of the characters. Also didn't really like the cameos over and over throughout the whole movie...I felt it was cheap and made to make the movie interesting since the story dragged so much. It felt like a gimmick."
"I was excited for this film and saw the first possible showing in my area. I was hoping to love it but I did not. Nolan's visual virtuosity is obvious it certainly featured a great performance by Irish star Cilian Murphy as Oppenheimer. It was not a surprise that Nolan did not follow a linear timeline and even utilized some sequences in black and white although for a much different reason than in Memento. The problem is any story about the Manhattan Project always has to deal with the large number of characters and the multi threaded timeline mostly just made it more confusing. Feynman was included as a very shallow character only to show his real life decision to watch the Trinity Test through a car windshield and not use the safety glasses like everyone else. I would have liked to see more of WW2 unfolding as I believe there was a lot of fear of Hitler obtaining the bomb first and somehow that urgency to me was not conveyed. They did not specifically cover Pearl Harbor but of course the bomb was eventually dropped on Japan as Germany had already been defeated before the bomb was complete. I believe there was good coverage on the issue of whether the bomb actually needed to be used in the circumstances, something people still argue about today. It was definitely a very good movie and Matt Damon was excellent as General Groves who was in charge of the Manhattan Project from the military point of view and essentially was Oppenheimer's boss. I would have liked a bit more about the many technical challenges the scientists overcame as I believe one of the larger themes of this history is great scientists solving incredibly challenging problems only to wonder whether the result was entirely of negative value."
"Oppenheimer is a masterpiece of cinema that explores the life and legacy of one of the most influential and controversial scientists of the 20th century. Christopher Nolan delivers a stunning biopic that combines historical accuracy, emotional depth, and visual spectacle. The film is divided into three acts, each focusing on a different aspect of Oppenheimer's career: his early studies in physics, his leadership of the Manhattan Project, and his downfall in the aftermath of the atomic bombings.The film boasts an impressive cast of actors who bring their characters to life with nuance and authenticity. Cillian Murphy gives a captivating performance as the brilliant and tormented Oppenheimer, who struggles with his moral dilemmas, personal relationships, and political enemies. Emily Blunt is equally compelling as his wife Kitty, who supports him through his highs and lows, but also suffers from his neglect and infidelity. Matt Damon is convincing as Leslie Groves, the pragmatic and ambitious military officer who oversees the atomic bomb project and clashes with Oppenheimer over their conflicting visions. Robert Downey Jr. Is menacing as Lewis Strauss, a ruthless and vindictive bureaucrat who orchestrates Oppenheimer's security hearing and tries to destroy his reputation.The film also features a stellar supporting cast, including Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock, Oppenheimer's mistress and confidante; Josh Hartnett as Edward Teller, Oppenheimer's rival and successor; Casey Affleck as Robert Serber, Oppenheimer's loyal assistant; Rami Malek as Richard Feynman, Oppenheimer's brilliant colleague; and Kenneth Branagh as Niels Bohr, Oppenheimer's mentor and friend.The film is shot in a combination of IMAX 65 mm and 65 mm large-format film, including sections in IMAX black-and-white film photography. The cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema is breathtaking, capturing the beauty and horror of the atomic age. The film uses extensive practical effects and minimal computer-generated imagery, creating a realistic and immersive experience. The film also features a haunting score by Ludwig Göransson, who blends classical and modern elements to create a unique and memorable soundtrack.Oppenheimer is a film that will stay with you long after you watch it. It is a powerful and poignant portrait of a man who changed the world, for better or worse. It is a film that raises important questions about science, ethics, politics, and human nature. It is a film that deserves to be seen on the big screen. It is one of the best films of 2023, and one of Nolan's finest works."
"Christopher Nolan really has given us some masterpieces and this is right up there with his best. It's refreshing to be reminded every now and again that cinema can, and should be, an art form. To come out of a movie experience and feel appreciation for the actors and actresses, the cinematography, the sound engineers, and everyone involved who brought forward their craft to create something that will pull you in from start to finish. I did not feel the 3 hour runtime at all which is testament to how well made and acted this movie is.The entire cast absolutely delivers but my two standout performers have to be Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt. Commanding performances from both and a joy to watch. Also, the makeup department that turned Tom Conti into Albert Einstein did phenomenal work he absolutely disappears as his doppelgänger!My wholehearted advice is that you go see it. In IMAX if you can, even if it's not the holy grail 70mm print Nolan so loves, go see it on the biggest screen you can. And then go back and see it two or three times as I intend to do, even if you'll overpay for your soda. Because in a sea of low-quality cash grabs and bland straight-to-streaming white noise, quality filmmaking should be supported, encouraged and justly appreciated. A large chunk of my theatre applauded at the end, and where I'm from such an outward reaction from movie-goers is very rare, but Oppenheimer fully deserved it and I hope it gets it over and over again."
"With Oppenheimer, Nolan has created the perfect cinematic cocktail. Outstanding soundtrack, photography, actors and script, all these things that make up the cocktail are worth an Oscar. The performance of each of the actors is impressive, they all create a perfect tune that catches you in the plot. Expectations were extremely high with Cillian Murphy's performance, however he has been able to far exceed them with a superb performance. I have rarely seen an actor interpreting a historical character in such a deep way, in which for a moment you forget that it is Cillian and you really think that you are seeing Oppenheimer on the big screen. This gives a great added value to the film. In my opinion, Oppenheimer falls into Nolan's top 3 films, ranking it in the first place would be somewhat pretentious having only seen it once. Without any doubt in the following weeks I will return to the cinema to see this masterpiece again."
"Within minutes of the movie you will be absorbed into it, mainly due to the stunning sound effects. Murphy has given the performance of his life. Brilliant movie. It explored all aspects including conception, generation, testing, deployment and the aftermath including accusations. No stone was left unturned.Nolan has delivered yet another masterpiece. Special mention fro the sound artists of this movie. This is definitely getting nomination or maybe even winning oscars in these departments
1) murphy acting
2) Nolan direction
3) SOUND ENGINEERINGKeep making such wonderful movies Nolan, more power to you."
"I decided to watch it yesterday, even though it wasn't in IMAX. But like all of Nolan's previous films, his ability to build a story is always intriguing to discuss. Even for a biography film, he managed to turn it into an epic movie that can't be watched just once.I might say this is the biography film with the most realistic set locations I've ever seen. Watching Oppenheimer is like witnessing a classical Mozart piano performance: it's hard to understand if you don't grasp the context behind it. Perhaps in a fictional film, the filmmaker would gladly explain to us what's happening, but a biography assumes that we already understand the subject's background. I might watch it for the second time after relearning the background of J. Robert Oppenheimer."
"Oppenheimer is an instant great in terms of cinema and Christopher Nolan films.Cillian Murphy absolutely smashed it out the park with this and cannot see anyone but him winning the oscar, alongside that both RDJ and Matt Damon are serious contenders for best supporting actor also.Rami Maleks scene at the end bashing RDJ is absolutely incredible.Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh - 10/10The film has you gripped right from the start, the way your heart starts to beat when the countdown is happening is so blood rushing, the silence after the bomb has dropped, listening to the heartbeats pure perfection.(Interstellar for me still number one, this is close second and maybe after a rewatch in IMAX it may bethe number one)"
"Big Spoiler
The film is called Oppenheimer, not The Atomic Bomb. That said, it is about the bomb, in that it is about human nature.An easier to follow Nolan film, I still want to see it again to revisit some dialog. The acting was top notch and a couple of Oscar nods ought to be in store for some.Another critic talked about the music being present, but not notable. I agree. As with James Cameron, so - so, functional musical scores are a missed opportunity. Think of Leone without Morricone, or Spielberg without Williams.I recognized people and acts from my own life in this film. I'm no great physicist, but I am a person who has told a story about myself, that doesn't quite mirror the reality of close examination. Which renders the closing of the film even more difficult, because Nolan is right. The atmosphere has been ignited."
"On the + side:
Good cinematography
Good acting (especially Robert Downey Jr)
Interesting story (quite reminiscent of the Alan Turing story)On the - side:
Dialog heavy
Annoying music almost non stop. Was actually hoping it would pause at times!The explosion is quite underwhelming. Didn't really feel the sheer devastating power of the bomb
I had hoped I would actually lean more on how they came up with building an A bomb
Felt long...All in all, quite disappointed and although beautifully shot, I never felt it deserved the 70mm treatment (especially since a good portion of the movie is set in meeting rooms or court rooms) and all the marketing around recreating the explosion. The original footage is actually more scary!"
"Same IMDB tripe. Masterpiece. Perfect. Flawless, blah, blah, blah. Its none of that. Its an overly long movie that at times confuses the viewers with flashbacks, BW to Color changes, historical liberties and political correctness. Don't get me wrong, This is the real Hitler and real Nazis and real antisemetism. But the whole latter half of the movie were Oppenheimer is disgraced due to his links to communism is overwrought. Didn't need to know how much of a philanderer he was. Could have fleshed out his relationship with the other scientists. At times too many characters. Good portrayal of Edward Teller.Not a date movie. Any nerd has working knowledge of this man. Nothing new revealed."
"I'm pleased to say that Oppenheimer lived up to the hype. It's an all-around solid movie with really great strengths.The cast was wonderful. This is some of Cillian Murphy's best acting, hands-down. I forgot that he wasn't actually Oppenheimer at moments. Emily Blunt (Kitty) and Florence Pugh (Jean Tatlock) were good, but even better was Robert Downey, Jr. (Strauss) who deserves an award for his performance in the film.The pacing was perfect, which is vital for a 180-minute long movie. I never felt the story stall or became bored or restless, despite it being such a long movie.The sounds and visuals in this film are mind-blowing. I was specifically in awe of the detonation scene; the seconds that ticked by between seeing the bomb and hearing the bomb were immensely powerful and moving. The bomb scene, while vitally important to the film, only takes up a few minutes. What's important, though, is that thought and care that went into that scene is present throughout the film.This is some of Nolan's best work and I'm thoroughly impressed by it. I was worried that it was being overhyped, but it was everything that was promised and more."
I have seen lots of film in the theatre s and after watching movies or film's you will either happy or sad but when you watch Oppenheimer you will come out thoughtful some thing will barz your head I don't know what will but it will that's is Oppenheimer and Nolan has make movies that are eternal for us but this is something else why it is because this just the biopic of farther of atomic energy but how Nolan hai present it that's was privileged for for all his fan that's why we love Nolan hand's down he is the best directors of our generation there's no comparison what Nolan has given to Film industry Hollywood should thankfull to him that's is it's form my side.
"This is cinema! For me, this is Nolan's most impactful masterpiece. It is without a doubt the best adaptation of a book I have ever seen. The story is portrayed in an incredible, tense and dynamic way. I like the fact that it is dynamic because it manages to hold the viewer well even in moments that would be calmer or even a little boring in other stories, but here everything is done very well for you to hold. One thing that helps to keep you hooked is the incredible interpretation of the actors, giving life and high realism to their characters and I especially highlight Cillian Murphy who is the soul of Oppenheimer. The film manages to convey the feeling of the scene very well, especially seconds before the explosion, making us feel in the protagonist's shoes and what helps is the fact that Nolan has not used any CGI the whole film, so it makes us anxious for the result as well as Oppenheimer and his co-workers."
"If you expect the usual from a Nolan's movie - some mind-blowing, hard to even explain plot, that's not the case. With Oppenheimer he relied on different approach of writing and directing, which I guess it's understandable bearing in mind the subject and the genre. I could even sense at moments Scorsese+Spielberg vibe(don't really know how to prove this statement, just really reminded me of their style in some of their works). Of course, he kept his uniqueness(different but interlinked timelines, importance of every word and action in the big picture and etc.) by adapting it to the needs of an epic about true fundamental historical events.Nobody could argue, or at least it wouldn't be me, the values of the film as an example of what real cinema looks like. A movie made for a big screen(literally IMAX is where it should be seen), visually stunning. As far as the cast, who am I to judge these talented people. I believed every word, every move, but what really stayed with me is Jason Clarke's perfectly acted let's say unpleasant character and the great Emily Blunt. I don't have words to describe how good is she in what she's doing. MVP...
What bothers me is that I lacked emotional connection with the movie. It couldn't succeed to bring to the state of really feel the mental consequences of being a key part of such a sick inexplicable event. Who knows, maybe it's me. I definitely need at least one more time seeing it and time to process. Maybe I'll see something I didn't. Maybe I'll feel something I didn't."
"Before I say my opinion, many people thought that the movie was classified as dynamic and expected fighting scenes, and so on. This is a grave mistake. The movie is a biography, all of it on Robert Oppenheimer. A conversational experience that is one of the most enjoyable. This is the strength of the movie. It is the language of dialogue between the actors. This is the basis of the movie. Not to mention the scenes of the nuclear bomb, which I classify as one of the best scenes that I could have seen in my life, the powerful acting, and more than expected from Robert Downey Jr. The whole experience is more than wonderful, and we must not forget the soundtrack from heaven, and I expect an Oscar for this music."
"A lot of people will call this movie boring, too long draging, maybe they're right. But for me Oppenheimer is cinema.I don't think we had a greater movie than this in the last five years, nowadays it's all just cheap comedy and politics, or terrible cgi,
This movie was clearly made with passion
I would call it nolan's best work.I thought story wise it would be about the bomb, I'm glad i was wrong, seeing the world around him crumble as he mentally collapses, is just great, the colorful Oppenheimer view, and Strauss' black and white view on the world, his selfishness ultimately destroying him, it was a masterpiece.Everybody fits into their roles. Robert downey junior's, frustrated face at times makes you really hate the character wich is good, cillian murphy, portraying that sense of guilt he has for what he has done, matt damon and gary oldman perfectly portraying greedy men. Emily blunt perfctly portraying that social anxiety the depression.Movies are made to make us think, about things we usually don't or won't put time to, this movie perfects that after watching this i felt empty and yet so full, it made me think."
"Murphy was awesome, rest of cast was great too. Some of the diologue was disappointing, too much hesitation at times, but overall good writing. I really don't like flashback scenes in movies and this one had several. Just add the scenes to the normal timeline...CONTINUITY people!!!! The story itself was so interesting, so many things I did not know about the ""gadget"" project and the scientists. I had no idea Oppenheimer was once a communist sympathizer! The other negative was the extended, corrupt interogation scene at the end. 10 minutes would have been enough of that. The story makes you think how perilous our situation is now, with so many nukes available for use at any time."
"Another Nolan masterpiece telling Oppenheimer's story and interweaving 2 different moments in time. Aided by the colour and black/white to contrast the 2 stories, it means you can sit back and relax, and marvel in what is an amazing piece of cinema.Cillian Murphy has the gong in the bag already but so does Nolan surely. The storytelling, direction, attention to detail, cinematography, it's all 10/10.Criticisms? None, only a realisation that I should've brushed up more on history before watching, particularly when you realise there's a whole 3rd act still to go after the bomb is dropped.You know you've been in a marathon when you leave the cinema, but you also know you've witnessed something pretty amazing."
"This film told the incredible story of how some of the worlds most brilliant minds achieved one of histories most momentous tasks. It contained some excellent acting performances and the dialogue was well written. However, there were parts of the story that were overly long and laboured with some of the special effect interventions either unnecessary or too long & dramatic. The single most dissipate annoying feature of the film (a common issue today in film and TV) was the sound. There were barely 10 seconds of silence in the whole 3 hours. The dial was overlayed with 'music' or sounds for almost the whole film, even when just two characters were conversing. There were sections of dialogue in the film which I will never know as they were impossible to discern being drowned out by the accompanying sound. Disappointing."
"Bombastic, loud, style over substance.So, it's a Nolan film.Making a sympathetic hero out of a mass murderer always feels tone deaf. This is no exception. For all the attempts to make ol' Oppy seem conflicted and troubled, it never really examines the impact of his choices. It does the usual things these biopics as spectacle do and overemphasises it's ""hero"" to the detriment of countless other historical figures. The way it's presented here, Oppy was the entire Manhattan Project and associated tests with a few hapless slack jawed helpers orbiting his ego.You'd be better off and better educated watching an actual documentary rather than this sanitised version of reality."
"Every part of this work of art had so much care, Love and attention put into every little frame of this 3hr long masterpiece, The writing acting and cinematography are phenomenal, But what stands out the most is the sound design/score which is the best in any movie i've ever seen, When the first bomb was detonated it left such a massive amount of time before you felt a shockwave feeling like the bomb had just gone off right next to you, The expressions on the characters faces was of utter dread and horror, The pacing of the movie was slightly slow but not boring at all, The whole film i didn't take my eyes of the screen for a second, 9.8/10."
"This film is all about feeling. Throughout its entirety the audience is inundated with music, sounds, and scenes that feel almost claustrophobic. It is clear that Christopher Nolan wants the viewer to feel a part of the process and drama. The viewer feels somewhat like a guilty party in the decisions made - neither able to object or to contribute, resigned to only spectate.The film's pacing is much like Nolan's previous film Tenant: one cut scene after another. Characters are built over the expanse of the movie but in pieces, not in large sections, with few exceptions. Oppenheimer's psyche is well known to the audience but is made aware to him through external opinions. Supporting roles clarify to the main character what reality is, not necessarily how most films are made, which is usually the other way around.As in most Nolan films, music plays an enormous role portraying emotion that should be felt, much like cue cards in a sit-com. Composer Göransson supplies a sophisticated yet relatively chaotic score that supplements the character and plot well by inducing a feeling of tension even in peace, sometimes especially in peace.This is top shelf acting of course, with a slew of award winning actors. Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer is strong, but only remembered more because the focus of the film is, of course, Oppenheimer. All other characters are so thorough in their respective roles that one could think, in another version, they too could be the main character. This is consistent with Nolan films, harkening back to Legder's Joker in The Dark Knight.The only downside of the film, if one could call it a downside, is that the dense film can create a sense of boredom if the viewers goal is to actually finish the film before dinner time, so to speak. The conclusions are inevitable, and somewhat predictable by about 2 hrs in, with the last hour being a very carefully, methodically tied bow. However, the last 10 minutes of the film redeem the boredom. If any viewers wanted a sprint to the end, they gladly held their horses to capture the full meaning. By the end, patient and impatient film goers alike were impressed, whether the marathon was a waiting game or not.Peak acting, directing, and writing makes Oppenheimer a must see for the average film viewer and snob alike. With a fast paced, tension building, long enduring film to view, the audience is relieved to leave the theater, but also spurred on to think about the modern implications of the (in)famous bomb builder that was Oppenheimer."
"To prepare for Oppenheimer I did everything wrong; I read 100 pages of American Prometheus, I listened to the soundtrack of The Last Samurai and Interstellar, and I expected too much.After leaving the cinema, I walked to a park and sat on a bench for an hour watching the sun set. It's summer but it feels like autumn here in London. I went home and drank a lot of vodka. It helped me pick my head off the floor. Something felt terrible, or maybe terribly unusual, inside me and I couldn't figure out what. How did a movie MOVE me like this? Only real death has shaken me like this before. So many questions I've been left with, but no answers... and so I must see it again!!!Bravo."
"As of writing this review, it's been 21 hours since the credits rolled, I traveled 2 hours by train, and slept for 14 hours.I never made it past high school, so my knowledge about physics and philosophy is limited, yet my interest is straight from the heart.I first read about Christopher Nolan doing a biographical drama about J. Robert Oppenheimer last summer, and that they detonated a nuclear device to record in 70mm IMAX, and I've been looking forward to this day for a year non-stop.Before going in, I knew that it wouldn't be as ""mind blowing"" as Inception or Tenet as their premises are that of fiction, but I went in with an open mind anyway, and it turned out to be even more mind blowing, but in another way. A way I didn't expect. A way of which I don't feel that my limited vocabulary will do it justice.I have a feeling of melancholy inside of me that I have never felt before. At least not from a movie. In my best words, ""I want to go back, crawl inside the screen, and stay there forever."" I am 28 years old and grew up with the Harry Potter series, which I enjoyed, yet I never got this feeling from any of them, even when I was a child. I get flashbacks and subsequent chills from Cillian Murphy's eyes, his acting, the two climaxes, and the abrupt silent sequences with the most visually spectacular orange colors I thought that I had seen before. The sounds, the visuals, the shaking, the tension, the empathy.There are no facts or information in this movie that you can't read anywhere online from searching ""Manhattan Project"" or ""Oppenheimer,"" but it's summarized so perfectly in the film, both objectively and subjectively. Something Nolan mastered some 20 years ago with Memento, albeit being a fictional story.I'm still processing the emotions from this journey. I have so much to say, but I can't find the words yet. In toto, this is the most flabbergasted I've been from a movie. It's the perfect mix of the right timing, the right director, the right cast, the right crew, and in my specific case, the journey behind travelling 1 hour each way by train to experience Nolan in IMAX (technically LieMAX, but I'm not complaining).I'm going again to watch it with my mom, and hopefully I'll have more words by then. So far, I'm too speechless and emotional to make an objective review without spoilers.If you enjoy Christopher Nolan, history, quantum mechanics, philosophy, and politics, and you get even the smallest chance to watch Oppenheimer in a modern cinema, do not hesitate."
"The movie is very well-written. All casts did their job very well. I could understand the movie even though it's 3 hours long but i was too excited and didn't realize it's actually 3 hours long. It's a movie that made my brain to think but i love it.I think this is a very high quality movie. Watching this movie actually made me think I have used my time wisely. It's a movie that's worth to watch because it's based on true story. By watching this movie, you'll learn history, science, life, and other things I don't know how to describe.Thank you for making this amazing movie.Please watch this movie. I really recommend it."
"The tale of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist who oversaw the Manhattan Project to create the atomic bomb, is told in the sweeping, epic movie Oppenheimer. The movie has spectacular visuals that beautifully capture the world of the Manhattan Project. The acting is outstanding, with Cillian Murphy portraying Oppenheimer with a masterful portrayal. The movie is also highly intellectual, diving into difficult philosophical and scientific issues regarding the origins of authority and accountability. Even though ""Oppenheimer"" is not an easy movie to watch, it will stick with you long after you've watched it. Anyone interested in human condition, history, or science ought to study it, in my opinion."
"Movie skillfully combines the elements of action, audio, acting, direction, and scene design into an unforgettable cinematic experience.This historical drama, directed by the brilliant Christopher Nolan, weaves a mesmerizing narrative that delves deep into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant
physicist whose work changed the course of history during World War II.From the moment the film begins, the audience is transported back in time to the tumultuous era of the 1940s, and Nolan's impeccable attention to detail immerses us into the historical setting effortlessly. The cinematography is awe-inspiring, and the breathtaking landscapes blend seamlessly with the authentic period settings, bringing Oppenheimer's world to life.Each actor brings depth and authenticity to their characters. Cillian Murphy shines in the lead role, delivering a captivating portrayal of a conflicted hero torn between duty and personal struggles. The supporting cast, including Robert Downey Jr. And Emily Blunt and Matt Damon and others, deliver standout performances that contribute to the emotional resonance of the narrative. The chemistry among the cast members is palpable, adding further layers to the film's storytelling.Christopher Nolan's direction is, without a doubt, a work of art. His ability to interweave historical events with human emotions and philosophical musings is nothing short of genius. He masterfully guides the audience through a rollercoaster of emotions, leaving us contemplating the consequences of our actions long after the credits roll.It is an absolute must-watch for cinema enthusiasts and an enduring testament to Nolan's lasting impact on the world of film."
My fingers can't describe what I saw I saw a masterpiece in opinion no movie will be as this I witnessed history today thank you Mr nolan for this masterpiece thank you for what you created let's come now to cllian murphy if this guy doesn't win the Oscar this is robbery ladies and gentlemen the plot the story the cinematography everything was perfect you need to watch it in imax please don't watch it in a regular screen. I am not Watching any movie after this because none can be better than this another thing Barbie will not even get that close to be good as Oppenheimer. Believe me you will get goosebumps after watching this masterpiece take a break for 10 minutes and let your brain reboot.
"It was difficult to hear all the dialogue as the background music drowned out most of the spoken word. I am therefore looking forward to the DVD release so I can watch it again - with the sub titles turned to ON! I also expect the cut scenes that didn't make the movie to help explain some of 'in my opinion' the missing links to the story. I considered it should have covered more detail about 'the bomb' and its development. I'm sure there will be many Oscar nominations from the film including Best Film, Best Leading Actor and Best Supporting Actor in Matt Damon but certainly not Sound!!! Overall - very disappointing. Oh, I forgot, an Oscar nomination for Ludwig Goransson for his music as it dominates the movie."
"In one way it is
in others ways it is not
but it is ...so he is a Jewish scientist; a physicist and although he is ideologically more akin to the sharing communist ideals he puts that on the back-burner to stop Hitler who was not a fan of his (Oppie's) peoplein many ways it is another one of those ""is not America wunnerful?""but basically what this dipstick did was to ignite technology which gave us the demise of Atlantis and that more than once (check the alternative History Books)so by 1943/44/45 we got back to that level. AgainAnd yes The Japanese did surrender promptly after Hiroshima/Nagasakibut at which price?And now we are lumbered with this poisoned knowledge and technology; just the same as we are with surveillance societyFilm was dull as dishwater until Damon entered; then it was only dull in partsIt is an important part of 20th century history and needs to be toldThe treatment here is borderline schlock; you expect (A)Tom Hanks to pop up any minute; thankfully he does notit could have been done a lot better; probably not by Hollywood thoIt is OK watchable but on the borders of dulldom. A solid 4.PS on the cultural sensitivity scales wow wow wow a sex scene whilst reading The Bhagavad Gita the most holy text of Hindus? Really imagine Bollywood makes a film in which the 2 main contenders interfere biblically which each other whilst reading The Bible hmmmmm how would that go down in The Bible Belt??? Did they have advisers on this? Hoe about same scene with The Talmud? What would the reaction be in the US? Israel? Quite a few Hindus have remarked on this in the 1 score reviews they are gobsmacked Could Not make this up could you? You do not have to Hollywood will."
"Now I don't mean to say that the Marvel movies or the Flash/Mission Impossible/ Indiana Jones aren't any good -despite their criticisms they serve their purpose as entertainment . But every once in a while there comes a film like Oppenheimer and you see exactly what Scorsese meant when he referred to these films like amusement parks . They're fun but largely forgettableOppenheimer is the complete opposite - miles and miles ahead of anything that these films could hope to achieve . Every now and then during the movie a part of my mind as an avid movie goer kept saying that this witnessing film history in the making . I was reminded of Scorseses quote that despite a lifetime of watching film we've just seen what cinema could doIn its 3 hour run time there isn't a single frame wasted or.a single character that feels wasted. The acting roster feels like you're seeing the Classic XI coming out to play . The right combination of popularity and acting prowessI was very happy to see Jason Clarke , Matthew Modine and even Gary Oldman in this .Robert Downey Jr. Once again proves why he's a living legend and shows us fully the man beyond Iron ManAnd as for the man himself - I have no doubts that Cillian Murphy is going to walk away with dozens of nominations and is the first serious contender for this years Best Actor Oscar . A lot of us film nerds have been rooting for him for a long time and were happy to see the man's stellar turn as the iconic Thomas Shelby and now with his portrayal of Oppie he takes that bar of excellence even further. I was reminded of the intensity of classic golden age Hollywood actors time and time againVery few directors have made me feel strongly about cinema- Stanley Kubrick , Martin Scorsese , Paul Thomas Anderson and NolanWatching this film is like witnessing a live rendition of a classic musical piece by Mozart ir Beethoven."
"I will regard this film as one of Nolan's finest cinematic achievements. This film seamlessly envelops the viewer in an atmosphere of palpable tension, mirroring the inner turmoil experienced by Oppenheimer himself as he grapples with the intricate dance between morality, politics, love, and war.The film commences with a reference to Prometheus, the Greek deity who suffered exile for bestowing fire upon humanity, drawing a parallel to Oppenheimer and his bestowal of a similar power upon mankind.Oppenheimer's magnetic presence effortlessly engrossed me in what felt like a fleeting three-hour masterpiece. A young scientist embarks on a harrowing journey, facing a multitude of trials-both metaphorical and achingly real-while bearing the weight of immense societal expectations and governmental pressures, all portrayed flawlessly by the talented Cillian Murphy. The raw humanity conveyed through Oppenheimer's courageous facade is truly captivating.The film masterfully captures Oppenheimer's inner turmoil through decisive scenes and a meticulously crafted symphony of ambient sounds and music. Each moment adds to the mounting tension, leading inexorably towards the climactic moment of the detonation of the atomic bomb, as if the thrill of a mere countdown could be elongated into a two-hour cinematic experience. It was as though I too, were a part of this very first nuclear test.While the creation and explosion of the bomb itself do not solely dominate the film's focus, they serve as a compelling backdrop against which Oppenheimer's adversaries maneuver in the shadows. These opponents, ranging from disagreeable figures to actively malicious forces, amplify the overarching narrative, providing an engrossing layer of intrigue and conflict."
"Oppenheimer made the bomb, yet failed to puzzle out power. All happened was a must, one way or the other.It is a brilliant tryout of Nolan. A feast of storytelling, directing, and acting. The film was build upon dialogues and events to reveal the complexity of entanglement among science, people, politics, and power. Together, history was made of a must through everyone holding their grounds and taking sides with or without doubts and questions that no one dare to answer. It is a sincere film load with various flavors to chew on.It does take quite bit of history knowing to better enjoy the movie."
"A work of art from this caliber was much needed in this current cinema industry. It shows simple yet incredible filmwork, without unnecessary effects and the story touches the heart and soul - something that many of us in the audeince haven't experienced for years ""thanks"" to Hollywood's recent movies. Above all it makes us think. Think about our personal missions in life, the responsibility for our actions and the injustices of this world. A briliant and chaotic mix of scientific genuis, humblness, lust for power, greed and treachery - all put carefully together in an accurate historical context. In a word - a move away from the cancerous virtue signalling Hollywood and striaght back into the world of classic cinematography by Nolan."
"Give everyone involved an oscar already!! Truly a masterclass.Intense in the best way (that score, my god it was incredible), so emotionally charged and not overtly long despite about 40%-60% of scenes being dudes talking science in front of a black board. Also the way it effortlessly moves between time periods while taking the time to let the story unravel naturally was perfect.Definitely worth seeing in imax if you can, the sound and cinematography were both stunning.This is a movie that leaves you thinking. I couldn't stop talking about it with my friend despite being so tired after the movie let out at 1am. Woke up thinking about it. Want to rewatch it. That speaks to how good it is."
"Oppenheimer: When I came to you with those calculations, we thought we might start a chain reaction that might destroy the entire world...
Einstein: I remember it well, what of it?Oppenheimer: I believe we didOppenheimer is the latest release from director Christopher Nolan and stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer as well as a supporting cast packed with A list stars. Earlier in the year I gushed over how much I love The Dark Knight and how great it was to re watch it back in the cinema for its anniversary release. As you can probably tell from that review I would definitely consider myself a fan of Nolan's work in particular, The Dark Knight trilogy and Interstellar. That being said Nolan's last film Tenet was probably my least favourite of his body of work but now he's back and rather than messing around with time travel he's got his feet firmly placed in the mid 1900s.Oppenheimer as you'd perhaps expect tells the story of how and why the first atomic bomb was created but that's simplifying this film to the nth degree as it's so much more than just that. It's very much a character piece about Oppenheimer the man, his life and the politics around the decisions he makes both pre and post building the bomb. A film of this nature requires a special acting talent to carry such a heavy role and Cillian Murphy proves to have it in abundance. I've been a fan of his work for a long time, I highly recommend Breakfast on Pluto which is one of my favourite films of his. In Oppenheimer though he steals the film in all the right ways and delivers a performance of a magnitude that I haven't seen for a long time.The film is three hours long and for the first two hours it follows the exact linear pattern you'd expect it to but then it goes beyond that. It looks deep into Oppenheimer's life after the bomb is dropped and delves into why while people in the streets were cheering his name certain members of certain governing bodies were trying to throw him under the bus. It's an absolutely phenomenal film and one that I can't stress enough how much you should see it on the big screen. There's no CGI and yet it's a real visual spectacle and you really feel the power of the bomb and how much devastation something of that power could create despite not showing any grisly images which Nolan could so easily have done.The best films for me are ones that are #1 entertaining #2 emotional #3 educational and this film has all of those things in abundance. Afterwards I was left with so many questions and thoughts around what would I do in Oppenheimers situation and how do I feel about the state of the world with the amount of nuclear weapons that exist in it. It's thought provoking, harrowing and undeniably entertaining from start to finish of its three hour run time. It's one of the best films of the year and I can't recommend it enough."
"Got the chance to watch Oppenheimer in imax during a quick stopover in Vienna today. Nolan's characteristic multi timeline strikes in maybe his most perfect fashion yet, brought to life by one of the best (and absolutely stacked) casts I've had the joy to appreciate in a long time. It is more of an essay on humanity than anything else, leaving you sitting in your seat lost in thought long into the credits.I wouldn't say imax is essential and I felt the pacing at the start was a bit quick for the circumstances but even still it is so much more than the already outstanding marketing gives it credit.Having the entire 400 strong crowd dead silent for the equally silent climax of the film was pretty special. Easily one of my favourite cinema experiences."
"Christopher Nolan is a genius on the level of Spielberg and Scorsese. The best anti-war film since Hair and Apocalypse Now. Brilliant Cillian Murphy, Robert Dawney Jr, Emily Blunt and Mat Damon, magnificent acting from all the actors, brilliant direction by Christopher Nolan. Perfect cinematography. Extremely good visual effects. There is not even one thing that irritates you A politically incorrect, stunning. You are speechless after the movie ends. I didn't think Hollywood could make such a worthwhile movie anymore. Will definitely watch it again. It might be the best movie made in the 21st century and hope it's not the last one!"
"Firstly in perspective, i am a fan of Nolan movies but in Oppenheimer, i find it is a bags of hits and misses. As a student of Physics, i do know more than a regular person on the Manhattan project and some of the characters there. I find it completely offsetting on what Nolan was trying to convey on the physics behind the bomb. All those visuals and music just don't work -I also find that Nolan was trying to find an angle for the subject matter and in the end, he put it on the backdrop of the communist witch-hunt done on Oppenheimer by Strauss and here, it fails for me too. The music and the pacing plus all the different layers you need to peel , is just too much. I am not surprised a lot of reviewers here are conflicted on their ratings - on one hand i feel they feel the need to give it some good ratings but it is either boring or a lot of the topics / parts flew past them.The pace felt rushed, the jumping around of the stories will not be understood by a lot of viewers who has no background knowledge of these issues or even the science itself. The science itself was very paltry and the proper link is not even visble to me, what more for a layperson with no background in physics.There were no issues on the actors involved (they are all good) and the technicality of the movies from the look, the detailed work in the sets and the competency of the filming done. That however did not go too well in my opinion is the writing of the story. Just on the topic of the atomic vs hydrogen bomb, the issue of fission and fusion. You can see this is one of the key issue that cause the friction between Oppenheimer and his accuser Strauss - but was the topic of fusion and fision between the two made clear? All we hear are some statements - that won't work - it's too complicated. You know in this area Nolan failed to make the science clear and no one watching was any wiser on it.Granted it is a hard topic to make easier to understand or even that statement about how Einstein was ""old"" and the new physics was to take over ...it is difficult trying to present context to all these and in that sense, while wanting to throw Einstein into the picture here, i find it is more of a show trying to put some famous scientist into the story. A better approach would be to come from the angle of the the quantum physics - and the excitement of that era in physics as new discoveries in those universities and the result of these discoveries present the issue of bomb (which was related by Oppenheimer in one scene)When it comes to the era of the inquiry/trial - the music and the way the questions was phased to be punctuated and the stepping of foots (footsteps of wars) - well that is Nolan way of making a point. For this , it fall flat for me.In my opinion, if this was to be done, it would been better in Oliver Stone interpretation of the JFK shooting where that one event hinge all the other stories and that strong line and clear visual and audio and the feel of that period and the urgency can be conveyed.I know the scientist who appears in the shows are merely token appearance from Einstein, to Bohr, Heisenberg and then finally the greatest sin, how Feynman was presented as merely a buffoon playing bongo drums. If all Feynman does was just to play his drums, then might as well not put him in. Since there were so many commie checks, a better way was to have Feynman arrested for his safe cracking antics and he was put in front of Oppenheimer to decide if he was some Russian spy. That will be in character of him and it will be a better representation of that brilliant later Nobel prize winner for Physics."
"Even though this film is about developing the atomic bomb, the only thing bombastic about this movie is the lack of substance for a 3 hour sit.Throughout the movie you'll hear suspenseful music that leads only to anti-climaxes. The dialogues were mediocre at best. Visually, this movie has nothing to offer. (The moment you see the atomic bomb explode in a test you see the faces of the actors instead of the bomb, extremely disappointing after watching minutes of counting down to that moment, and hours before the countdown starts)As far as Nolan goes, as usual the movie is unnecessary complicated. Skipping through time with flashbacks had no place it this film. It could have easily been told chronologically. But, like I said, there wasn't enough of a story to begin with.Making you feel like there is any substance, comes from skipping through time and suspenseful music. Though this film probably tries to portray an image of a man who morally questions his own invention, it was too much of another war criminal glorification to me. If I had to describe all of it I would say: too American.Another movie about communists and corrupt informal lawsuits.This is definitely one to skip. Could have been a movie made for cable tv broadcasted on a weekday.The stars are for the actors who had to carry this monstrosity. Plus, as a Dutchie I'm also getting quit tired of filmmakers making the same mistakes over and over again. Confusing the German language for the Dutch language.Minor details, but if you are going to spend millions on making a movie, get your facts straight."
"After watching this movie twice, it's safe to say this is a Nolan Masterpiece. There are a lot of reasons this movie works, the cinematography, the performances, the story, and last but not least the score. The shots in this movie are done so well the way they were able to capture weather in New Mexico and Britain, the way they were able to show the mind of Oppenheimer, and the way they were able to show us the two sides of this story was nothing short of amazing.The performances were some career best. Cillian Murphy will no doubt receive a nomination for best actor and RDJ definitely deserves one for probably another career best. This movie flaunts it's dedication to characters by having hollywood heavyweights like Oldman, Affleck, Malek, and Branagh in such minor roles, but they nail the role so well that you don't even really acknowledge (especially with Oldman) that is that actor as you instantly get immersed in that characters role in this dynamic. Damon, Safdie, Dehaan, Hartnett, Conti, Peck, Bostick, Quaid, Pugh, Blunt, the list goes on of the characters who are sort of on the sideline throughout the story and although their roles are all minor as well they all blend in so well you feel a sort of realism to how these scientists really were and how this project really went. Krumholtz and Clarke were both stand out side characters along with Emily Blunt as characters who had a lot of great moments while Safdie stole a lot of moments at los-alamos. Conti as Einstein was also a really good casting. Honestly I could go on about how amazing the performances were so you're just gonna have to see it yourself to believe it.The story is told in a very unconventional way but it works so well and they picked a very interesting way to tell several stories at once. By using the trial we are able to see the entire professional career of Oppenheimer while focusing on the Manhattan project and the fallout because of it which lead to the trial. Then it shows Strauss's view and his motives, but while it shows that and goes back to what the truth was we see the contradictions. Then it is unfolded as we see the truth of the trial and the small moments and instances that lead to this trial. If I get to into it I'd spoil it and as with most Nolan movies the timeline is hard to explain you have to watch it to see how good it is. Also the ending to this movie is the most profound ending I have ever seen in a movie it leaves you thinking and in a good way it's not all horror like some suggest it is. It is by far the best ending scene in a movie which says a lot because many movies best moments are the ending scene.The score is the best since inception maybe even better it's insane. I have very few songs from a movie that I have listened to more than destroyer of worlds from this movie. This score hits every scene perfectly it brings the moments of tension to a whole new level of anxiety and intrigue. The triumphant moments are that much more triumphant, the ending is done masterfully. I can not say enough good about this movie's music.What's wrong with this movie, well it has a few issues that are worth noting, mostly just unnecessary scenes, the sex scenes with Pugh are done for accuracy and for its importance to the trial, but there was no reason for them, we didn't see him bone Kitty or Ruthy, it was sort of just a scene to have. I don't even think they were bad the scenes were done tastefully, but unnecessarily. I also thought that some of his montages earlier in the movie were a little bit messy for pretty much no reason other than just to be there.Overall this movie is the best Nolan has put out in 10+ years maybe ever 9.7/10."
"Damn, Nolan's still got it. Dunkirk is kinda slept on, and Tenet got some weird crap it didn't deserve. But as far as general consensus goes, Interstellar was Nolan's last masterpiece, coming out nearly a decade ago. And now there's Oppenheimer. What a revelation. Insanely tense, dramatic, with masterful acting; literally not a single misstep. The writing is somehow at a breakneck pace throughout the whole thing, simply because there is so much to cover, but the density doesn't dilute the film in any way. Every beat, moment, and scene builds and unfolds in the exact way that it needs to for the perfect shot, outcome, and progression. What an addition to Nolan's filmography. A monumental achievement for a behemoth of this industry."
"Sure! Here's the short review of the film in English:This film is an extraordinary cinematic masterpiece with stunning cinematography. The plot is captivating and presents a brilliant storyline. The actors deliver exceptional performances, conveying emotions and characters convincingly. The direction of the film deserves praise, providing an unforgettable viewing experience.The sound design and music complement the film's atmosphere perfectly, creating the right mood for each scene. The editing is precise, adding a flawless rhythm to the film. While the production design is commendable, a slight improvement could make it even more exceptional.Overall, the film truly lives up to expectations, offering an outstanding viewing experience. It's a memorable work of art that deserves appreciation."
"In this extraordinary film the performances of Robert Downey Jr. (RDJ) and Cillian Murphy have an impact, on the audience. Murphys portrayal of a man witnessing the devastating effects of a bomb is hauntingly authentic evoking a mix of terror and disbelief that lingers in ones memory. RDJs portrayal of deceit, ego and jealousy is climactic. Showcases his acting skills.Director Christopher Nolans distinctive cinematic style is evident throughout the movie capturing emotions through angles and frames. The cinematography is visually stunning adding depth to the storytelling. The film explores themes related to nature and the consequences of our choices challenging viewers beliefs and actions.In conclusion this thought provoking film is a must watch for any lover of cinema. The outstanding performances, direction and profound storytelling create a resonant experience that touches the depths of our souls. Prepare to be moved as this remarkable cinematic masterpiece takes you on a gripping journey, through the complexities of emotions and thoughts."
"The idea that Oppenheimer was the most important man in history as suggested once here seems more in line with UFOs flying over military nuclear installations than a sober review of our history. But be that as it may, this is a pretty engrossing film, though I do think Mr. Nolan is a little too mesmerized with the story.I've visited Los Alamos but probably got a more accurate sense of the facility during the Manhatten Project from this movie than I did from today's monster installation. And that was a welcome revelation. And I had read about Edward Teller's balking at several of Oppenheimer's decisions and wondered how that would be handled. And it turns out that was one of the most impressive parts of this movie. The actor was spot on and so was the script.Clearly this is no half-hearted attempt to put this part of our history's relevance into focus. It's skillful and persuasive, but for me, at least, a little over played. I still appreciated it quite a bit, though I'm not sure a general audience will feel the same."
"I write this short review as a person who has never been a hardcore fan of Christopher Nolan. Still, I think: This could be Nolan's masterpiece.It's a well-rounded movie almost throughout. Only in the first third it struggles a bit with introducing all the characters & unwinding the plot on such a short time given.Soundtrack & sound design are absolutely top notch.The choice of actors is perfect & the acting masterful.The play with perspective, the different time levels & interwoven story lines were complex, but by Nolan standards very understandably described.Several times you could note meta-comments about Oppenheimer & the film as a work today.All in all, the film is simply impressive."
"Having read the book before the movie, it's actually a broad picture of the man centered around the trial.Nolan has always this story teller talent, and it's perfectly executed here. As the story represents more than an decade of events, Nolan succeded in giving a comprehensive narration with the Trinity test as its turning point.The actors are amazing, they all bring something new to the table, their interpretation are on point.I really liked the idea of not showing anything about Hiroshima or Nagasaki, these events are difficult to describe as they are part of horrific events during the war.Incredible biopic, and even after watching the movie you still wonder what this extraordinary person think about the consequence of his work. Nonetheless it's worth it !"
"I recently watched the movie, and it's yet another masterpiece from Nolan. Although I saw it in a regular theater since we don't have an IMAX in our country, I was still deeply moved by what I experienced during the 3-hour film. I can only imagine how incredible it must have been for those who saw it in its intended format. Murphy's on-screen presence was never in doubt, and Cillian's portrayal finally showcases what a great actor he truly is. Nolan's promise to show everything through Oppenheimer's eyes was brilliantly captured, especially through Cillian's expressive and captivating eyes. His performance made a lasting impression on me. Robert displayed not only his star power but also his exceptional acting skills, delivering one of the most memorable performances in the second half of the movie. As expected from Nolan, this film sets a new milestone. The move had an every element served to the viewers. It surpassed my already high expectations, thanks to the remarkable cast, compelling story, stunning cinematography, and Nolan's dedication. I feel fortunate to have witnessed this epic film, and I believe both Cillian and Robert deserve Oscars for their outstanding performances. Without a doubt, it's the best movie of the year."
"And that's pretty much it. Thought I'd be going in to a visual feast conceptualizing quantum mechanics, much like Interstellar did for physics; but was only rewarded with one profound line about how most of the space we occupy is empty, but the matter that creates us also convinces us that there are barriers within that space, or something. So brief and unexplored.The a-bomb scene had some good build up and tension, but felt almost forced within the story. It also fell flat visually. Show us the x rays and blood vessels the men see when the flash envelops them. Nah, just reactions to a bright light lit up by what looks more like a regular gas explosion on a smaller scale.Finally, let's spend the last hour documenting the courtroom drama that tries to keep your interest with the score, but even that becomes insulting since we've already experienced it a thousand times before by now.At least I got to see Florence Pugh IMAX boobs and booty."
"That is the first time I have legitimately fell asleep in the movie theatre. I am the biggest Nolan fan but I honestly can't see what the appeal of this movie was. It's a painful slog with zero entertainment value, should have just been a documentary. I am not sure who the target audience is for this movie, how is it getting such high ratings?What's more it has somehow the most pointless nudity and jump scared I have perhaps ever seen in a movie, which is so strange because Nolan films in the past distinctly did not rely on such cheap tricks. Seriously why is a film about a physicist chock full of nudity and jump scares? Do people not have a criticial bone in their body anymore? Even Tenant was better than this trash."
"I'm still thinking of words and ways to describe what this move accomplishes. It's long, but you don't feel like it. The story is so compelling, and the movie so we'll executed, that you want it to take long, you want it to be exactly what it is: a masterpiece.I've been a huge fan of Christopher Nolan's work and Cillian Murphy's acting for a while now, and even though I had high expectations, what they did with this film was above and beyond.You're drawn to the story, there's an emotional connection to the characters, and what a way to describe something that really happened, which I didn't know about in details.This is a must watch. Truly enjoyable, nail-biting, intense and rewarding experience."
"Why do I say I have to get an Oscars Award especially to the Mega star 'Cillian Murphy' and 'Christhoper Nolan'?This film is very good and very interesting that we can even listen directly to the sound of a bomb explosion which is millions of tons of TNT made in atomic fusion. This movie is too awesome And deserves an Oscars Award. The history of Oppenheimer which is not widely exposed can now be seen and watched live.The characters in the film are all extraordinary. Matt Damon as LT General. Leslie Groves, Rami Malek as Dr. Hill, Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss.Hopefully there will be a sequel to this film again. Even lifting the story of Hiroshima and Nagasaki directly."
"This is a fantastic movie and no, you do NOT need to see it in IMAX. But Nolan using IMAX sized stock makes him able to use some of the best lenses in the world to photograph faces (or a conference room) in a way you have not seen on a cinema screen yet. And this is a movie of faces. And if you have competent standard projection, you still see why this is photographed in IMAX.And while I like movies that make me think, if Nolan would give a slightly clearer hint about the ""Fission""/""Fusion"" or Color/B&W split of the movie, instead of making it totally cryptic until you see the last scenes (before that I though it was just a help to understand which time we are in, but it has a totally different meaning), I would enjoy it even more. But Nolan seems to be on a crusade to demand twice your money because you need to see it a second time to understand the subtleties in the structure. Certainly will see it a 2nd time, but in 4K UHD at home because, I repeat myself, the creation, not the projection, needed IMAX.Best supporting actor to Robert Downey Jr. Please."
"This is my first review ever and as a big Nolan fan I have never come to write any on some of his other phenominal films but I have finally decided to write a short review to highlight Oppenheimers work of art.To start with, Cillian Murphy is just excellent and is everything I hoped for - he truly embodied J. Robert Oppenheimer. R. D. J. After many years in the Marvel universe has returned with a bang! Matt Damon was also great and I particularly enjoyed Murphy's and Damon's character dynamics and dialogues together.The dense screenplay is oscar worthy. The film however is quite dialogue heavy but is made up for by the breathtaking cinematography and the well-written script.Lastly, I have always believed that music is what moves us emotionally during a film. Ludwig Göransson has yet again created an absolutely thrilling and suspenseful score thats flows extremely well with the films pace and aura. These are my personal favourites - give them a listen if you haven't already!: ""Can You Hear The Music"", ""Meeting Kitty"", ""Manhattan Project"", ""American Prometheus"", ""Trinity"", ""Something More Important"", ""Destroyer of Worlds"", ""Oppenheimer"".And yes... Of course I am writing this review whilst listening to the soundtrack."
"Oh man! What to say Oppenheimer is one best history movies I have ever seen. Christopher Nolan pulled it off again. The trademark Christopher Nolan things he did in this film makes this movie so good, mixing the timelines (like in memento), beautiful screenplay, heavy dialogues, fantastic cast, and many more, I can talk about this movie whole day so.... But still people finding it boring I don't know how? Literally my friends were sleeping throughout the film but who cares if you like the movie then who cares right! Ofcourse it has science stuff because we are talking about ""atom bomb"". C'mon man physics chemistry maths is the basic key to becoming a scientist.....
If we talk about cast then I will take any name because everyone did a mind-blowing job....
Anyway if you are a Christopher Nolan fan you will going to love it and if you like slow movies like me then you will definitely going to get fun for what you've paid for...
Parental guidance - It contain nudity so ya you cannot watch it with your family but still pls do watch it......"
"""Oppenheimer"" is more than a biopic about the father of the Atomic bomb. It's a film about the nature of fission, but in an even larger sense than the splitting of an atom and the collision of subatomic particles. It's about the splitting of a man's soul.It's also about the collision of science and morality, of quantum physics and politics, of ambition and hubris, and of love and responsibility.In riveting imagery and sound, director Christopher Nolan steers us through the complex story of Robert Oppenheimer's creation of the weaponry that moved civilization to a dangerous new precipice. Nolan employs all his skills to make us see and feel what he imagines Oppenheimer experienced while moving us to the precipice.""I am become death, the destroyer of worlds,"" Oppenheimer says, quoting a sacred Hindu text, after his bombs obliterated Hiroshima and Nagasaki to end World War II.This is the ""triumph"" of Oppenheimer's genius. It's also the ""tragedy"" of it.Nolan based his film on the book ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,"" the Pulitzer Prize winning work of Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. The movie opens with a title card explaining how in Greek mythology ""Prometheus stole fire from the Gods. For this, he was chained to a rock and tortured for eternity.""Nolan shows us how Oppenheimer suffered chained to his own rock.""I have blood on my hands,"" Oppenheimer said when he met an unsympathetic Harry Truman after the bombs were dropped. The president mockingly handed Oppenheimer a handkerchief to wipe his hands and then told his secretary of state he didn't want to see that ""crybaby"" scientist back in his office again.Nolan's screenplay is crisp and taut but muscular enough to carry the weight of the film's heavy themes, from the basic scientific challenges to the equally complex moral ones. There are portions of the storytelling, the parts told in breakneck dialogue, that bring to mind Oliver Stone's JFK, but they don't make your head hurt the same way. Nolan does a masterful job simplifying the complexities without dumbing them down. There's also some subtle foreshadowing that will take most of us a couple viewings to fully appreciate, including a poisoned apple scene that beautifully sets the table for the moral challenge Oppenheimer faces after creating the bomb.Nolan uses creative sound effects and an arresting musical score to connect us more viscerally to the emotions percolating at almost every turn of Oppenheimer's journey, with tense string music and dramatic percussion amping up the senses and mood. He uses all those tools he perfected in Interstellar and his Batman movies to make this true story more compelling. He uses sound, like stomping bleachers and shaking walls, to help move us inside Oppenheimer's head.Cillian Murphy is terrific channeling Oppenheimer's onfidence, as well as his naievete, insecurity and regret. He looks so much like Oppenheimer. It feels like an Oscar winning performance. Emily Blunt is equally terrific as Oppenheimer's wife. Robert Downey Jr. Is difficult to recognize when he first enters the film, but that's fitting, as his character slowly reveals his political nature. Downey reminds us how his range goes way beyond super heroes. Matt Damon is more than solid with so many stars coming and going in supporting roles. It's fun seeing who turns up.The making of the Atomic bomb is almost too ambitious to fathom, and the making and unmaking of Oppenheimer is equally difficult to grasp. Nolan called Oppenheimer the ""most important man in history"" but also one of the most ""ambiguous."" Nolan leaves us unsure how we ought to feel about Oppenheimer. As a scientist, his calculations were so precise, but as a man, he epically miscalculated the heart of the men who would judge him. ""How could he see so much and be so blind,"" Downey's character says.How much should we admire Oppenheimer? Or pity him? In this three-hour film, Nolan couldn't answer what history's never really been able to answer. Fission, after all, isn't easily fathomed, but it can be spectacularly displayed. Nolan gave us that in his best work yet."
"A post appreciation for the film, this time Oppenheimer's film by Christopher Nolan, and this is the second time in this near me experience of a ""true film""Why is that? Film is the product of several aspects/divisions from writers, composers and many more, and this film or Christopher Nolan manages to stitch all of that into a whole and ""good"" filmmaybe this seems to make this film good but in my opinion and for me because it started not to have more expectations in this film it turned out to be more than imagined, and Nolan did it.How many media or actor Robert Downey in this film talk that this is a MAGNUM OPUS and yep idk what to say, this is the best film I watched in my entire life (still 12 angry man number one but).And lastly, maybe there is momentum or the writing/method of ""playing"" this will potentially be used or used by future directors.P. S Sorry the writing is a bit stiff like the typos because I wrote it while still being amazed by the film but you get it right?"
"Once again Nolan doesn't disappoint fascinating movie it is, I have to say the Pacing it's brilliant should watch it in theatres. It's complete biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer it's based on his life and the fact Nolan used a real atomic bomb was a life time moment to see and experience it in the theatres if you're a Nolan fan who likes action time to time i might say it's different with Oppenheimer so heads up, but the plot twist was really good damm, like it's good and hats off to top notch acting Cillian Murphy did don't worry he will get the Oscar for sure , You will not see Cillan Murphy you will see Oppenheimer in real life that was the experience for me probably he was Oppenheimer in his past life. I hope this review will lead you to watch the cinema."
I absolutely loved the trial bombing scene and also the scene where he's giving an interview right after the bombing which is one of the best scenes ive seen in cinema in a while. The whole first half of the movie was amazing. I loved the visuals and the dialogue was pretty good as well. I loved the way they also included einstein in the movie and how he influenced oppenheimer. The second half however was lackluster. It was too dialogue filled which I dont mind too much but it's a bit difficult to understand for the average viewer and also it runs way too long. I feel like it was mostly politics as well which most people arent interested in. Great movie but could've been better.
"After Tenet, I was hoping Nolan makes something good, because let's be honest, Tenet was a movie about a very simple, template idea trying to be told as a complex, loud masterpiece. So, as I have a complicated relationship with Nolan movies, I really hoped this movie will be as good as the Prestige.NO ! THIS MOVIE IS BAD !This fast cutting, is really not working great with this movie, Oppenheimer's trial, is totally illogically starts in the beginning of the movie in ""not-flashbacks"", And in the end it's too long. The sound is loud, but these stock video explosions are just laughable. I know people like, if a movie is fast, but in this movie the fast pasting is always in the interesting scenes. The acting is very average, except Oppenheimer and Strauss, I guess...So my last word is...I have to watch Barbie :("
"A film written and directed by the legendary Christopher Nolan. Based on the 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film chronicles the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a theoretical physicist who was pivotal in developing the first nuclear weapons as part of the Manhattan Project, and thereby ushering in the Atomic Age. I added synopsis here so I can fill up the limit met, lol. This is from Wiki btw""now I'm become death, the destroyer of worlds"" this line of Oppenheimer revolved down the aspect of the movie's story. I don't want to spit anything about the film but what can I say is, amazing, just amazing. Imagine leaving the theater feeling empty and stunned that you don't know what you wanna express. Its that kind of feeling."
"Never before had such a shiver run through my body. The ending is completely shocking, you don't understand what you feel. Those emotions are conveyed so vividly, as if you are experiencing everything yourself. Only Christopher Nolan could make such a powerful film. The music especially adds strength to the film. The actors are chosen perfectly. I can't think of another actor who could play Oppenheimer. It may not be for everyone, but it's a must-see for everyone. I saw the movie in the cinema and I recommend everyone to see it in the cinema because it's a completely different feeling than watching it at home on TV."
"This may go without saying but you have to see this in IMAX or a GPX screening. I think seeing this in a standard theater diminishes the marveling ingenuity of it. Immaculate sound design coupled with a perfect score. Visuals were explosive (pun intended) & intentional. Casting was sublime and Cillian Murphy has to be the front runner for the Best Actor in a Leading Role academy award.The first two hours are rapid-paced, talking-heads & cross-cuts between three timelines. It is a marveling cinematic achievement in the way it's structured and how effective it is at telling its story. Also, the usage of color vs black & white and varying aspect ratios aided in the visual storytelling from different points of views - helping drive home the overarching theme of morality, the choices we make, and the consequences of those choices.There wasn't ""down time"" to process everything going on but I was genuinely invested & intrigued throughout the runtime. Third hour changed the pace & maneuvered into a different style of movie but it absolutely still worked for me. I had no real prior knowledge of the subject matter outside of the general titles (ie. Oppenheimer, Manhattan Project, Atomic Bomb, etc) and, while it may have helped in some ways, it wasn't necessary to know much going in.There was an increasing, tangible anxiety & tension as we neared the crux of the second act that, even in knowing the outcome, had my Apple Watch sending constant rapid heart rate alerts.In a very real sense, this felt like Christopher Nolan's Manhattan project. It seemed, to me, that there was an autobiographical essence overlayed onto a biographical adaptation. Not that Nolan sees himself and Oppenheimer as a 1:1 comparison, but rather that he sees similarities in terms of their existential crises, how the world views their work & how their genius in respective fields are discussed in society.While this movie wasn't 100% perfect, it is still a 5/5 star film for the shear power it displays in its audio, visuals, and writing. I think this movie best displays just how incredible a director that Nolan truly is.--Seeing it again over a week later, this time in 70mm IMAX, was a moment I'm glad I had. Seeing a packed theater with every seat filled, on a Tuesday night for an 11:20 pm screening, almost two weeks after its initial release, is a testament to the power and sheer magnitude of a Christopher Nolan film.Seeing the noise of film on a huge screen, noticing the changes in the aspect ratios, the overwhelming loudness of immaculate sound design coupled with a propulsive score...WOW.I called this Nolan's magnum opus after my first viewing on opening night at a GPX theater. Seeing the 70mm version only solidified that. GPX equates to seeing Starry Night or the Mona Lisa at a museum behind glass; 70mm felt like watching Van Gogh and da Vinci turn the canvas around as they finished painting them.This is a cinema-defining masterpiece.OSCAR NOMINATION PREDICTIONS:

"First off, Cillian Murphy. Wow. What a performance. You feel EVERYTHING through his portrayal of Oppenheimer. Every. Single. Thing. Shoutout to Robert Downey Jr. Too. Best dramatic performance of his since Chaplin, easily.Secondly, for 3 glorious and hauntingly beautiful hours, I was leaned forward in my theater seat glued to every single scene. Every second of this film is worth your undivided attention.This is Nolan's best. Which really isn't said lightly by me, considering his body of work and my love for anything related to Batman. But, this, this movie is a masterpiece. An absolute masterpiece. An instant classic and a movie that will go down as one of the most important of the 21st century and possibly, of all time. Oppenheimer is, in my opinion, a movie that deserves to be studied, scene by scene and shot for shot, by every single current and aspiring filmmaker, actor/actress, screenwriter, producer, etc. This masterclass of a film belongs in a museum.Go see this, especially if you don't have a particular interest in WWII, or American history, or world history, or science. I promise you'll care about at least one, if not all, of those topics when the end credits start rolling."
"I'm a massive movie fan. I'm a massive Christopher Nolan fan. Almost all of his movies are in my top rankings.As big of a movie fan I am, I've not been to the theatre since I was a kid. But when it was announced that Nolan was coming back with Oppenheimer, I made a decision to definitely try and go. Because I loved all of his movies that I watched (except for Tenet, it was too mind bending for me!)
I did however have the reservation that it might not be as good as his other movies, given that this was a biopic, and maybe he'd be limited in telling the story in his famous style that made me fall in love with his other fiction movies that defied reality. He had parameters in this movie, which I thought may restrict him. How wrong I was!I watched it in IMAX today, and was completely blown away. Obviously, the cinematic experience was phenomenal, and I was astounded by the audio & visual quality. It was so immersive, and the soundtrack was spine chilling. Every speck of dust, every pore on their faces, every musical note came through so clearly.The pace of the movie was unnerving, every scene was so short and sharp, and it was punch after punch after punch. It was so purposeful.You hardly had time to process things. It took me a while to get used to the absence of subtitles which is a staple in my daily viewing, but once I got used to that, I found I was focussing so much harder.And focus I needed, because, for the first 2 hours, I was just about hanging on. I was confused at certain things, and didn't have time to process/figure out other things. I had a basic understanding, but needed it to fit together.And in true Nolan fashion, there came a moment in the movie, where EVERYTHING CLICKED. It was like a millisecond of time pausing, and then sudden clarity. This is master storytelling and genius craftsmanship. And he told it in vintage Christopher Nolan style...how dare I doubt him?The last hour was epic, I can't praise his construction of the story enough. It was masterful.Oh and the cast performances...PHENOMENAL. SENSATIONAL. GENERATIONAL.I can't recall seeing someone totally immerse themselves into a character like Cillian Murphy did. He was devastatingly brilliant. Emily Blunt brought so much emotion & feel to her character. Another amazing performance.Robert Downey Jr. Totally blew me away, just so much depth in his character. He's the one I can't stop thinking about.Many aren't talking about Matt Damon, he was beyond excellent for me. Absolutely loved him.Another standout was David Krumholtz. So impressive.Lovely cameos from Kenneth Branagh and Gary Oldman (obviously!). So much elegance and quality from them.I did think of reading American Prometheus, or doing research beforehand, but i instead relied on Nolan's storytelling to explain things to me. And that he did with aplomb. Glad I didn't research things too much and spoil it.All in all, I really enjoyed this movie, would love to watch it again soon to understand it even more.So glad I experienced this cinematic masterpiece in the theatres."
"Like literally amazing, this movie is fantastic the direction, cinematics, acting and each scene of this movie is thrilling. Great storyline and original story too was depicted really well. The originality and quality of this movie is what makes it the best. Its difficult to understand at start but if u have interest in this field, then this movie feels awesome!!Just go and watch it and enjoy the experience!!If u dont have any prior knowledge to the story I would indeed advise people to just watch a short documentary or a youtube video before the movie as it will help u more to understand the plot and experience the movie even more!!!!!!!!"
"Simply extraordinary, a film that goes beyond the historical part about the creation of the atomic bomb, emphasizes Oppenheimer's character, his emotions and the terrible remorse that led him to face a terrible situation with the government that turned its back on him. A very powerful film, very deep in what it seeks to express and with one of the most epic endings in the history of cinema.Simply extraordinary, a film that goes beyond the historical part about the creation of the atomic bomb, emphasizes Oppenheimer's character, his emotions and the terrible remorse that led him to face a terrible situation with the government that turned its back on him.

"The movie is not about biography and historical timeline of Oppenheimer. It's something more - it's a story of in one side just a man who do his job like a professional in the name of science and in the other side it's about a man who became a personification of dead.C. Nolan tells emotional story not just between black and white. In this discord there are not Yin and Yang, there are so many points of view and in the foundation is one human life. The music in the movie and the sounds is amazing. When it's all have to be noisy there is a dead silence and when it's all have to be quiet - it is like a blast.It is very good key to tell the story in the first person all colourful and when the story is for third person - the screen is all black - amazing.Must watch in IMAX!"
"I really don't like this biopic craze that started with Bohemian Rhapsody. New age biopics are reductive and are glorifications of lives. They often paint the protagonist in a simple good guy role and fill in beats of their life. This format doesn't lend movies to interesting characters in stories. They always fall short of telling a good story and stick to a book report of someone's life. Like this happened, and then this happened...etc.The 'based on a true story' trend often feels more like a crutch than a catalyst for great storytelling. It serves as a crutch and limits the writing, dialogue, character and therefore story which is what you come to expect from movies. It's a fluff piece that gets people interested in their life and for people socially to talk about. That's what they are good for.Compare this to the Social Network or Catch me if You Can. They took some creative liberties with the truth. Also biopics, but interesting stories.This brings me to Christopher Nolan's biopic on Oppenheimer. Sometimes you're watching it and you're like why is this important. It feels like he read the book and is just stream of consciousness telling you. 'Oh and did you know Oppenheimer did this?' 'Oh and they couldn't leave Los Alamos to Chicago' 'Oh and they had nuclear reactors under football stadiums' 'Oh and one of his lovers killed herself.' Some of the pieces of the story fit but there is no strong thread running through to the core of the character of Oppenheimer that ties everything together.This is a well reenacted book report with a bland conclusion from Christopher Nolan. Nolan doesn't take a stand on Oppenheimer being a megalomaniac or to have him be flawed in a way that we won't like him for it. Which feels like he is just hitting story beats of his life rather than telling a story and having strong causality of what Oppenheimer did which is essential to telling a story.Yet there are some interesting bits. I enjoyed the political intrigue of Lewis Strauss and how the story builds that out and relates it to Oppenheimer's penchant for the limelight that is subtly hinted at. But Nolan really doesn't do much beyond that.On a lighter note, the bomb didn't look big. :/ I liked the effects though, they were cool. But the bomb didn't go boom boom big enough.In terms of enjoyment, I liked Lewis Strauss's plot line and seeing the star-studded cast. Overall, it was a fun time, but I found myself growing tired and ultimately, I didn't care."
"I love everything Nolan has directed. Everything. He is one of my top directors, but this was not it.. I was as excited as always to see the new stuff from him, but this time I left dissappointed. It felt like if Christoffer Nolan directed twelve angry men, only in three paralell timelines. I get that Oppenheimer had a fascinating and important story, but this was not a particulary good movie.. It was incredibly made production wise. Probably one of few movies with top tier actors, and delivers. But movie wise it's too thin. The bit that bothered me the most was the editing. So fast paced. Jumping from one conversation to the next one. The whole film kinda felt like a blockbuster movie trailer, and when I watch the trailer - that has a much better pace than the movie. Going to watch it again to see if I missed anything, but at the moment this didn't feel like a Nolan movie. I even liked Tenant which many didn't.."
"Masterpiece would be an understatement for this film. The intense moments that hooked us to the seats 🔥. Music, performance, Direction , cinematography ellam 10/10 . The only slight issue was the duration but Nolan makes it very engaging aakkum . A must watch theatrical experience. I dont think this would wirk out if you watch it in your mobile phones, laptops . It should be experienced in a movie theatre. I wouldn't say Imax if you have the cash go watch it in IMAx but i watched it in a normal theatre but the impact was beyond words . The middle portion the trinity test scene is worth all the money you pay for . Overall a brilliantly directed and executed Cinema."
"Spellbound, this word, I was phishing in my mind while climbing down the theatrical stairs. However, how do you call this film, Oppenheimer, it does have another name. Masterpiece, A Subjective-Objective Non-Linear Drama, Written for the screen and Directed by Christopher Nolan.Cillian Murphy, you... you are a PHENOMENON. Others too, Robert Downey Jr. , Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Matt Damon did a fantastic job.Oppenheimer is all about this man, Christopher Nolan. As always, Interstellar is my favorite pick of Nolan's filmography, yet it remains.As a writer, Nolan worked out the magic wonderfully. Wait what, which magic? The non-linear dramatic representation using ""2 different yet same timelines"" creating a Masterclass Screenwriting. I felt Nolan re-created himself into a more ""Matured Writer"" and that's why Oppenheimer surpassed Following to my second favorite film of Christopher Nolan. 2nd half of the film is seat-edged.I feel very biased to write or speak about Oppenheimer because, it's not enough to conclude here. In fact, words and star rating is not enough. I really understood Oppenheimer, and appreciating the Film."
"Having looked through the reviews I fail to see how anyone could possibly give this less than a 7. Ok potentially 1 off for 3 hours but they flew by .Possibly 1 off if you do not know the history or the relevance of how important this development was at the time.God knows what else you could take points off for.The acting is sublime with Cillian and Robert Downey Junior leading the ways of numerous 5 star cameo performances, too many to mention.The film is a visual historical delight with the exception of the wring flag ( who cares ).It is truly based on fact - Oppenheimer died of cancer at 62 from the chain smoking portrayed as an example. The rest of the film has been developed di well as the majority of it is on public record.I can only advise you to see it for yourself if the subject matter is off interest and you want to know why we now live in a world full of nuclear weapons."
"Definitely one of the best movies I've ever watched. The soundtrack in Nolan's movie is always the best, same for this movie. The way the scenes were arranged made me go deep into the plot. All the cast members were also at their best in acting, particularly Cillian Murphy. I hope he wins academy award as the best actor for this work. Some people might say the movie was too long for them, but I think each and every scene was made to be as short/fast paced as possible. If this movie were made shorter than this, it won't be as good as it is now. I will definitely suggest watching the movie if you can. During watching the movie if you think it's too long, just hold on your patience. If you can't keep your patience, good movies are not for you."
"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer film may be best film of 2023. Based on the book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of Robert Oppenheimer, the film is a tour-de-force that brings to life the rise and fall of the ""father of the atom bomb."" Like in his films Tenet and Inception, Nolan uses non-linear storytelling. The film is divided into two parts. Part 1. Fission, which covers Oppenheimer's rise in the 1940s, as head of the Manhattan Project, creating the first atom bomb. And Part 2. Fusion, which covers his dramatic fall in the 1950s, after being accused of Communist ties, loses his security credentials.Nolan, who's directed two Batman films, knows how to create and present a superhero. In one early scene, Oppenheimer, preparing to meet with his project team of scientists, dresses in his suit and tie, puts on his 1940s-style fedora, places his pipe in his mouth, then exits as though he were a superhero preparing to save the world.The Manhattan Project was a race to build the A-bomb before the Nazis did. The most dramatic scene in the film takes place on 07/16/1945, the day that Trinity, the world's first atomic explosion takes place at Los Alamos, NM. The team of mostly American scientists and engineers party and celebrate the success of three years of experimentation and dedicated, hard work. But it appears that only Oppenheimer sees both the triumph and tragedy of the accomplishment. You can't help but think of a similar day on 07/17/1969, the day Apollo 11 astronauts walked on the Moon. Both celebrate American 🇺🇸 scientific and engineering achievements, but result in dramatically different outcomes."
"First ever movie that has multiple timelines running at the same time with subjective and objective POV. He compiled about 6 hours of content into 3 hours which is amazing but it had some extra content which was not needed. Overall the movie was probably the best movie created by him but was a bit hard to understand for the audience that don't know the proportionality of time in his movies. The trinity test and the speech scene got to be one of the most iconic scenes Nolan has ever done, very terrifying and shocking Overall I would say this movie is not better than Dark Knight, Inception and Interstellar just because of the complication in it."
I have watched this movie with my friends. Most of them got bored all the way throughout the movie.they did not understand the science and history behind all of this. But for me this was something different than other drama war documentaries. This was thought provoking one.we got to understand the Oppenheimers point of view and what a nuclear weapon can do. If it was not then someone sure have used atleast once nuclear bomb. We got to learn the history n power politics at that time. How scientists can change the war scenarios. How spies played their role in nuclear chase. It was so much to understand and comprehend for future generations.
"I've seen Oppenheimer yesterday and I can say it's without a doubt one of Nolan's best ever! It's a very complicated film, which is sometimes difficult to understand (especially in the beginning) - but you'll get rewarded at some point and all of your questions disappear!It is not a film for those, who just want to be entertained by as many explosions as possible (it's not a Micheal Bay film 😅) It's a film for people, who are really in love with cinema and great storytelling, and this is what you'll get here!It's a 3-hours biopic, but it felt much shorter and I wanted to see it another hour!Now I only want to say: Go and watch it in the theaters and be existed about all the thing you're going to experience! It is something else! 🙌🏻"
"Another Nolan film which never reaches its full potential.The first two hours, I seriously considered a 9/10, but that final hour completely DRAGGED.The sound design was terrible, unless it was just the Cineworld showing I was in, the music drowned out almost all dialogue for the majority of this film.I'm not sure who is responsible for cutting each shot within a scene; the director? Cinematographer? Editor? No idea... but cutting back and forth 9 times in under 4 seconds (in one scene) is an absolute eyesore.The bomb itself has to be the single most overhyped practical effect I've ever been blue balled over.Nolan really prefers this ""Tell, don't show"" style to his work.Oh...and Cillian Murphy's accent slipped a couple times, and ended up Cameo-ing as Thomas Shelby for a few sentences.Additionally, correct me if I'm incorrect but, Nolan seemingly constructed this true story film and made it feel more like a mystery within the final hour. Just tell a true story without trying to elastico the ball into the net in the 90th minute.Aside from all that, enjoyed the most of it. The first two hours really built and built tension with a great score to compliment it.7/10."
"2 negative things which i felt :
1) Background music is a strong tool to use to increase the impact of a scene. A fast chaotic BGM signifies that a scene or a sequence of scene is moving towards a crescendo.Every scene, even the most normal conversation had a fast paced bgm. V annoying. Right from the start.2) too much of politics shown & hardly any physics shown. The explanation of the bomb etc.For eg, look at the mini series ""Chernobyl""
They showed the science behind the making of a nuclear reactor, the sci behind the accident, sci behind the containment & damage control of the accident.The scientific genius of opp was hardly documented. The movie was all about the political juggling done by him during his lifetime.Also,
3) when the movie is about history, it is good to atleast mention the names with their titles in a small box at the bottom when you introduce them 1st."
"Seen it yesterday July 20.Basically, all the praise already given in this space to ""Oppenheimer"" is merited so I am not going to bother everybody with repetitions or with vain atempts to say the same by other words.I will only highlight what in my personal view is the most impressive achievement in technical terms as a whole: terrific sound effects, gorgeous music, great mixing. Ludwig Göransson, whose work until now I was not familiar with, is almost certain to be decorating some shelf at his home with a certain golden statuette by, let's say, next spring, if you catch my drift.A tsunami of award nominations, possibly very close to record breaking numbers is lying in wait for this film.I have seen all Christopher Nolan's movies.This is his best.9.5 out of 10.P. S. The reasons why this masterpiece does not get a perfect 10 are, first, the fact that the dropping of ""Little Boy"" and ""Fat Man"" constituting horrendous crimes against humanity was not conveyed clearly and conclusively enough and, second but equally important, what happened to the populations around Los Alamos in the weeks, months, and years immediately after the ""Trinity"" test? All fine and dandy? Lived happily ever after? Radiation contamination doesn't apply there? I don't think so."
"A truly powerful film about the development of the most powerful bomb of its time. Cillian Murphy delivers a career best performance as the timid J Robert Oppenheimer. This is definitely a film you want to see on the biggest screen near you. It is well worth the extra ticket price. A visually stunning movie that takes advantage of every inch of the screen. The film explores the complex Manhattan project, which produced the worlds first atomic bomb. Christopher Nolan is a mature filmmaker at this point in his career and it shows, as he weaves through the complex (and perhaps slightly too long) story. He absolutely nails the ending however, and the final scene of the movie really stuck with me. Overall a strong 9/10."
"We all know what to expect when we go to see a Christopher Nolan movie, total intensity and constant movement in the plot, in Openheimer, some of these have changed.The objective of this film is to represent very punctually and in detail the events that occurred in the life of Oppenheimer that were crucial for the development of the atomic bomb and finally, the aftermath and subsequent events.I give it an eight. My very sincere opinion, I love Christopher Nolan's movies, he is one of the best filmmakers of all time, but I think this movie is overloaded with too much biographical information (which a lot of it is incredibly important to be remembered in history).I would have liked that there were scenes filmed in Russia or Japan where some of the events of the story occur, but regardless of that! The performances are something incredible actors like Murphy, Blunt, etc.You have to see it, I totally recommend it!"
"Although i wouldn't say it's for everyone, Oppenheimer has proved itself, atleast for me, as one of Nolan's best and easily the best movie to release this year. The visuals and editing were just phenomenal and the casting was even better. I personally think RDJ stole the show, playing the snakey antagonist incredibly well. If you're into a rooted story, intense dialogue and are well versed in world history, this movie is a must see. My only complaint is that some aspects were a little tough to follow, but a rewatch will surely clear those up. If you haven't already, definitely go see this movie!!!"
"Oppenheimer, the man that changed the world forever. This movie is incredible let me just say. From the screenplay, characters, actors, all the way to the sound design, costumes, and set design. All the little details are there, Christopher Nolan doesn't miss a single one at all. Nolan delivers a force to be reckoned with, easily the best movie of 2023. I've never been so moved and touched by a film of this caliber in a while. Nolan isn't the only human to deliver a masterpiece for this film. Cillian Murphy nails it as J. Robert Oppenheimer, his acting is beyond brilliant. Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr also stand out majorly in this film for me as I find their performances as captivating as Murphy's. In summary, this film is detailed to the brim, the acting is beyond incredible, and the film is one of the ages. One of the absolute best films this generation will have and one of absolute greatest movies I'll ever see in my entire life."
"I already had high hopes for this movie and it was an absolute blast (no pun intended) and I could've watched another 3 hours of this movie. The movie itself tells the story in an interesting way, it's in the present (the late 50s) and goes from the 30s back to the present to the 40s then back to the 30s etc. The performances of Cillian Murphy, rdj, Emily blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, we're incredible, even small roles with big names like Casey affleck, rami malek, Jack quaid, Devon bostick, Josh hartnett, Gary oldman and even more were fantastic, during the middle of the movie when the trinity test scene happened was probably the most exciting part of the movie, this movie is going to sweep the Oscar's with acting nominations and best picture, cinematography, score, directing and more. An all in all great movie."
"A very great movie but you have to focus because the scenes are short and move very quickly and you need prior knowledge of the characters and the story. You can watch a YouTube video explaining it, Nolan excelled in this movie, as well as Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., It should be in the list of the 40 best films of all time at least The cinematography was the greatest thing I've seen in cinema, as if I was looking through a window, as if a nuclear explosion occurred in front of me, I only wished for more appearances of the greatest scientific mindset in human history, Albert Einstein....."
"Oppenheimer was absolutely phenomenal. It is hard to know exactly how I am going to deal with having seen it, probably by seeing it again and again. Having seem it in IMAX (as it is supposed to be viewed) was totally worth it.I assume those who see it are fairly familiar with at least the broad storyline which makes it better when you now get to see it from Oppenheimer's own perspective. You get to follow his experiences regarding the process and see how it affects him as a person.The acting, the writing, the score... everything was done to perfection and Cillian Murphy should be praised for his portrayal of this troubled physicist. The only thing I have to say to those who have not yet seen it is: do it."
"I believe that Nolan did a very good film. It is historically accurate and stays true to its name by showing the development mostly through Oppenheimer's eyes.I wish it was much less politically oriented, even though many would appreciate that. I hoped for a lot more physics and was looking forward to seeing how it would be explained to the general public. Unfortunately, that was underwhelming and far too little part of the movie for my taste.I also was very excited to see how Nolan would present the atomic explosions - the test and the two in Japan. Left disappointed, even though there were some well-made aspects.The conflict point between Oppenheimer and Strauss was not really convincing to me.Lastly, I was hoping for a lot more of a focus on the destructive consequences of the atomic bomb as well as the moral struggles of Oppenheimer after the bombing. It was displayed but not enough for my liking. Instead, it was more of a struggle to prove he is not a national traitor. Again, this is historically true to the events. For me however, it is not something the makes the film great."
"Why didn't the filmmaker add Oppenheimer recurved his clearance back from our current government in 2022? That would destroy the martyr narrative of the movie I guess.This is actually a typical Hollywood movie which has a take on history that's not entirely accurate but fits the narrative du jour - liberals good and just (even if they don't follow the rules their moral narcissism prevails) republicans bad immoral and mean. I gave it a 4 because it is relevant as history is repeating itself as our current government is persecuting people because of their viewpoints. It's incredible that Hollywood would so accurately portray what is playing out in our country today, however that is not the filmmakers intent.This movie is so long with all kinds of unnecessary parts - trust me it is not a riveting 3 plus hours. Cillian Murphy, Gary Oldman (who provides the only levity in the movie) are very good as is Florence Pugh. Robert Downey Jr over plays his hand and Emily blunt phones it in.I would not recommend the movie. Hard to resist with all the masterpiece reviews - it truly is not very good even if you are cool with the gaslighting."
"Exceptional! Murphy plays Oppenheimer and aced it. Nolan's greatest work ever.Can easily see Cillian Murphy winning best actor for this performance that he EMBODIES. Such an incredible role for Murphy & glad he finally gets the full opportunity & stage to shine as leading man. Matt Damon has proven himself to be a TERRIFIC actor and this is easily his best performance also. RDJ just melts into his role with a method performance that I've yet to see apart of his acting repertoire.Please go see it at the theatres, it is a MUST. This is one of the best experiences I've ever had sitting in a theatre. ""Oppenheimer"" is one of the best looking films made, PERIOD. 70MM is the way to go for the sheer visual magnitude, that will unfold & glow before your very eyes. I'm very excited to see what the word thinks of ""Oppenheimer"" 💣 I believe it is the biggest & baddest film of the year so far.THIS IS IT, CHRISTOPHER NOLAN's GRAND MAGNUM OPUS PEOPLE. I've still got an earthquake going on inside of my body. My body is trembling, it was virtually EVERYTHING!Knowing BARBENHEIMER is officially over makes me very sad. However, I will definitely be going back to see ""OPPENHEIMER"" a second time. Especially, before anything else that comes out this year.I predicted the Oscar sweep for Everything Everywhere All At Once Last year and I'm here to say it again, this will sweep at the academy next year. I love predicting stuff so I'll live with the rest.Bravo once again Christopher Nolan, you are a MAGNIFICENT filmmaker. This may be my very favourite film of yours yet."
"After his last outing Tenet, which wasn't as well received, Nolan decided to venture a biography. Oppenheimer is very different from all the movies Nolan has attempted before, deviating from his SciFi orgasm and moving towards reality and grounded cinema. It could be a recency bias from my end, but I think Oppenheimer is quite possibly Nolan's best movie till date. It's a culmination of all the things Nolan attempted in his prior movies: the cinematography, the sound, the bgm, the screenplay; everything just works in a perfect culmination. The BGM of this movie makes the scenes erupt with tension and add a different perspective altogether. The tension created esp in the scene where the bomb is tested is just an iconic scene altogether. It's so brilliantly shot and executed that words cannot do justice to it. Another iconic scene is where Cilian gives his celebratory speech, which shows what an intelligent filmmaker Nolan is. The actors are amazing with their roles. Cilian and Robert Downey just steal the show overall. Although it's 3 hours long, but you're so engaged in this movie, thanks to the brilliant screenplay with Nolan who juggles with so much content, yet executes it brilliantly, that this movie never feels like a bore. One of the finest movies to come out of Hollywood and it deserves a watch. A Must Watch."
I can't type straight after watching this masterpiece by the great Christopher Nolan. The presentation of the story was out of this world. At the end I was horrified by the reality of this film. Cillian Murphy gave one of the best performances I have ever seen of a conflicted man who tried his best to choose the lesser evil and failed. And how masterfully Nolan captured it. Every explosion shook the soundboxes in the hall and made me realise and feel the dread of the Atomic Bomb. Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr were fabulous. One of the greatest and most important movie I have ever seen. Mind blowing experience and a dream come true.
"I was going to give this movie a 7, but in good conscience I couldn't. Christopher Nolan has spoiled us with so many good movies, that the expectations I had were way too high, the quality of the movie were overshadowed by them.By quality I mean of course, the music, the cuts, the shots of brilliant representations of physical phenomena that oozed raw creativity. The acting by top class actors/actresses, the very sweet and sour romance scenes, that appeared to be side stories but had still emotional impact. The build up to the test scene of the bomb, that felt forever due to the tension and anticipation created, just by showing little essential details of the realistic bomb assembly and detonation aspect.All very Nolan, all amazing. As every one of his movies, it just feels clean, never rough on the edges, always deliberate, always transparent regarding his intentions of every scene.Now I was going to give this movie a 7, primarily because of how dialogue driven it is. A lot of reviewers praised the script but personally I was disappointed by the story. It leaned too heavily on the political, it is fair to say that half of this movie is a look at red scare propaganda and its consequences. A movie about the bomb, one of the most technical weapons in human history, a collaborative effort of the greatest scientific minds and you chose to focus on politics ? Granted WW 2 espionage also makes for great movies but if you are to put Oppenheimer as the star, you cannot rely on politics. That was my opinion as I watched 2-hour long footage of people just talking about russians, communism, spies, backstabbers, meanwhile a bomb was being built in the background.The most interesting aspect, the science, the war, the moral and very real physical devastation, the strain it must take on one persons mind were addressed but never emphasized.The first bomb test, as a side note, was not that great. You could definitely tell that it was dynamite.Still a great watch, not Nolan's greatest though."
"The only downfalls of Oppenheimer come in some of the editing (please editors, let some of these moments breathe) and the near constant score. Some more times of quietness would be good. Otherwise, a terrific watch and a movie future generations should see.The entire cast provide meaningful, emotional and genuine performances. Cillian Murphy is incredible in the lead, giving us a true anchor for our journey into the world of atomics and quantum physics. The cinematography is incredible, depicting the scope and grandeur Christopher Nolan is known for. The sound design too was incredible, all sounding authentic and perfectly matched to what was on screen."
"Oppenheimer Review (1/n)It's not a surprise that I loved the movie. The benefit of watching the first show is a good audience & they maintained deathly silence throughout the entire film. It is a constant upward graph, with every scene getting more dramatic as it peaks in the silence of the blast, and the drama takes a very different tenor. The sound is perfect; it carefully caresses every scene to perfection. The fast-paced cut scenes, the melancholy yet quick background score & the chasing of three timelines at once - collectively make for an exciting watch. The three hours barely felt like one. The emotions felt are immense, & deeply enveloping. A person watching the film should feel the impending doom & a lot of anxiety that the thrills create. My legs couldn't stop shaking, with troubled emotions racing through. The message, I believe, is mankind will destroy mankind. Actors, & there are so many, have really done well. Haven't seen a film this star packed since Endgame, I guess. Loved every performance, and specially enjoyed Robert Downey Jr , Emily Blunt, Jason Clarke & Cillian Murphy!"
"This film rests on the shoulders of Cillian Murphy to portray the Universe of J. Robert Oppenheimer told in a brilliant and fantastically visceral story, seen through the masterful eyes of visionary writer/director Christopher Nolan. And Murphy is nothing less than stellar. Breathtaking. The way Nolan manages to cast a fantastic roster of brilliant actors to meet this ""first person shooter"" of a movie is a piece of art in itself, all done to support the burden that Murphy had. As with most of his films, ""time"" is overly present in the naration and the writer/director lets us figure out who, what and when in brilliant and relatively easy to get way. The editing is fantastic, by the way. Some of the scenes are presented as too exaggerated and a bit too dramatic, with an overly powerful music score that seems as an overkill at times, so they can be a bit tiring. Having said that, the ""Trinity"" scene (please see the film to figure the scene out, no spoilers here) is a tension building scene that has, probably, no equal in the not so recent movie history. It will be remembered as one
of the most dramatic and superbly executed scenes of all time. Seriously. Not only that, but a subsequent ""speech"" scene is equally visceral, to the core. To sum it all up, you should not miss this piece of art and, please see it on an IMAX screen, as the director intended."
"Really. A movie that is just nonstop talking will fly by to a confusing point. How did I just see all that and ingest it all in 3 hours and it's like the previews just ended? The people who thought it dragged on forever... I mean... are you trying to make Americans look stupid? I usually really, no matter what, can barely make a 2.5 hour film without getting restless. That would include other Nolan films (all of which are great). This goes by faster than a kid's 75 minute movie as long as you know it's a biopic. Now that should be apparent based on the description of this movie being a biopic of Robert Oppenheimer, but I digress.It's my new favorite movie of all time and a film professor's wet dream. Nothing like it ever made or ever will be. I would liken it almost to a non mocumentary Citizen Kane. Can't wait to see it again."
"""Oppenheimer"" unfolds as a captivating portrayal of the life and achievements of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant mind behind the discovery of the atomic bomb. Christopher Nolan, once again, weaves his directorial magic in this mesmerizing masterpiece, although it does demand a considerable time investment with its three-hour runtime. Unlike typical action-packed thrillers, this film opts for a more profound approach, delving into pure drama and history.While some viewers may perceive the movie as dialogue-heavy and scientific, it serves as an authentic representation of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life and the challenges he encountered. The narrative beautifully unfolds, highlighting the complexities and struggles faced by this extraordinary figure.The climax of the film delves into the heart-wrenching reality of the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, leaving a lasting impact on the audience. Cillian Murphy, an exceptional Irish actor, delivers a phenomenal performance in the lead role, bringing Oppenheimer's character to life with remarkable depth and emotion.""Oppenheimer"" emerges as a must-watch movie, especially for those who are unfamiliar with this significant piece of history. It serves as a powerful source of knowledge, shedding light on a remarkable individual and a pivotal moment in human history that shaped the course of the world. While it may not cater to everyone's tastes, this film undoubtedly stands as an insightful and enlightening experience for those willing to delve into the depths of history and human brilliance."
"Ok so I'll give credit where credit is due. The Manhattan project and life of j. Robert Oppenheimer was quite interesting and seeing the bomb go off was amazing. However, there was scenes that got me fired up. The boring red scary McCarthyism garbage causing him of being a spy, his wife being a cuckquean watching imagining her husband do. Girl on a chair who had nothing almost to do with the plot. It was so boring after the bomb went off. I nearly fell asleep hoping something interesting would happen. I wasn't expecting action or anything like that but I didn't expect it to end where he gets his clearance revoked?! Ok? They found him to be a loyal citizen yet revoked it because he was doing what Matt Damon asked him to do?? And I'd like talk about one scene too that got me fired up. This is during world war 2 so while there's millions of men dying out Europe and the east, there's a general and men in suits who are just sitting and talking about bombing Japan and one man goes ""we have 12 cities to bomb. Well 11 actually, me and my wife went on vacation to this city before"" this scene made me mad. And then all of oppenheimers colleagues turned against him. And iron man (RDJ) was playing the big bad politician or something. And jack quaid is there. Mostly a boring movie. I give it a 4/10 because I give where respect is due watching that bomb was pretty cool in imax. I shouted out ""wow."" Once it ignited in silence. But other than that this is just American anti communist propaganda bs who ruined the reputation of a great physicist who was just doing what the government asked him to do but think only him could have created it he even said it was a matter of time until they discover how to make these hydrogen bombs. They just wanted to point fingers like all America is only good at doing."
"Undoubtedly, for all cinema lovers, Oppenheimer was one of the most anticipated films of this year, and for me, it was the most anticipated.A movie that I go with great excitement to watch it in Imax Laser
and Just as I expected, the cinema was full of people and the interesting thing for me was that I feel the excitement for watching the movie among the audience.Well, it must be said that this movie is an important movie
Newlin's most political film with a very special story that takes courage to tell such stories
In terms of acting, it is one of the most star-studded films I have seen
That is, the actor who won the Oscar just a few years ago
He is in this movie for a few minutes
Everyone played their role in the best condition and with their highest ability
I really thought a guy who was a physicist would cut women out of his life completely
But no, Oppenheimer built an atomic bomb, and he's an atomic bomb in bed! :))
This film has a part of about 15 minutes and tries to depict the explosion of the atomic bomb.It's scary, it's so visually suspenseful in terms of sound, which was really amazing
Of course, since most of the film's hype was about bomb blasts, I personally expected more from the bomb blast sequence.Which is understandable due to not using special effects.The film is not only about the atomic bomb, but also about the character of Oppenheimer, as the name suggests.The moment of the atomic bomb explosion that ends is not like you say, ok, the climax of the movie is over, there is no more interesting place
Oppenheimer's feeling after the atomic bomb explosion is more important than the atomic bomb itself
Not using special effects here has limitations that have negative and positive points that I will not mention to avoid spoilers.The soundtrack of the film is definitely one of the masterpieces of the cinema and one of the main chances of Oscar, and we all know that the soundtrack is important for Nolan and an integral part of his films, and in this film, music was played in the background in almost all the sequences.If I want to say briefly When I came out from the cinema, this movie was a complete knockout for me, it opened my brain like a twisted plutonium core and made me stare at the cinema screen until the end credits!The film is a character study on the grandest scale, with an excellent central performance by Cillian Murphy. An epic historical drama but with a distinctly Nolan sensibility that makes it remarkable for its tension, structure, sense of scale, amazing sound design, special effects.This film can be called an amazing achievement in honest adaptation, conciseness, innovative storytelling and subtle performances by Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon and many others in it.The audience will be completely attracted to Oppenheimer in this film. A dense, talky, tense film, partly about the bomb, and mostly about how doomed we are. Murphy is good in this movie, but the support from Damon, Downey Jr. And Pugh is essential. A daring, innovative and complex film that shakes its audience.You will be amazed and emotionally destroyed after watching this movie. I think it's going to be a stunning artistic achievement and I hope it really sparks a national and even global conversation about the issues that Oppenheimer was so passionate about. This movie is about how to live in the atomic age and shows how to be patriotic. The film also explains the role of a scientist in a society immersed in technology and science to talk about public issues.Oppenheimer is... incredible. The word that keeps coming to mind is scary. Nolan has crafted a relentlessly paced, intricately detailed historical drama."
"Black- white.Good-bad.When talking about humanity thimgs are not this clear- such this movie conveys the story of the A bomb.Nolan have done a superb transfer of Oppenheimer's story to the wide (and even wider) screen.Excellent pick of actors. Recently I have watched the interviews and recordings about Oppenheimer - and so did Cillian Murphy I can tell since he displayed the role so well.RDJ is my all time favourite so I won't praise him here, Emily Blunt is on the spot playing her character painfully sharp and when it needed witty. To be honest I just realised after I watched the cast that Florence Pugh played in this movie as well and for me was a surprisingly good performance.But lets talk about Benny Safdie performance as Teller Ede (sorry I am a proud hungarian) aka Edward Teller: I am buffled- beware a new star coming around! He also portrayed Teller as he was (might have had been)-cudos for him!I don't recommend this movie for those in need some brainless / chew-and-spit movies but for those who like thought inspiring stories based on real life events.Go, watch it and enjoy the ride. Have a bottle of wine chilled afterwards.You'll need it."
"""Oppenheimer"" (2023), the latest masterpiece from Christopher Nolan, delivers a captivating biographical drama about physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer's journey during WWII and the development of the atomic bomb. Nolan's brilliance shines with impeccable casting, stunning visuals, and a thought-provoking exploration of science and history. This film is a must-see for enthusiasts in these fields, although its intellectual depth might challenge some. ""Oppenheimer"" leaves a lasting impact, showcasing Nolan's directorial prowess and his ability to engage audiences with complex narratives that resonate long after the credits roll.Oppenheimer undeniably a cinematic masterpiece that appeals strongly to science and history enthusiasts. However, for those not interested in these subjects, the film may prove less engaging. Christopher Nolan's brilliant storytelling and attention to historical detail might not resonate with viewers who are not drawn to the complexities of science or the intricacies of historical events. While the movie offers stunning visuals and strong performances, its emphasis on scientific discussions and historical context may leave some audiences feeling disconnected or disinterested. For a truly immersive and rewarding experience, ""Oppenheimer"" is best suited for those with a passion for science and history."
"Christopher Nolan did it again. He proved why he is considered one of the finest director and storyteller of modern cinema (even in throughout the history maybe?). I witnessed this today in theater, and I gotta say, what an experience that was! The story was simple and yet very complicated. The story is supposedly the biopic of the famous American nuclear-physicist J Robert Oppenheimer before, during and after the WW2, and yet every incidents are complicated in their own ways, and every person are unique and complex, just like every literal human-being. Everyone has their personal goals to achieve, everyone has their personal world-view, everyone has their mistakes, setbacks and realizations, and everyone has their insecurities and deep-lying flaws. The character developments and arcs and the on-screen chemistries between the characters were very satisfying to watch. Even every minor or side characters got their moment to shine. The BGM was splendid, and the screenplay was definitely one of the finest I've seen in recent years. In fact, this is the type of subtle and mature storytelling that I love so dearly. And when the movie was over, I had a smile on my face, cause I've known instantly that I've experienced something that I haven't before."
"Oppenheimer ended with me wishing it was longer. The characters, acting, music, effects, writing were all classic Nolan at his best. Steeped in paradox and multi-layering, this watched like a documentary but with pure drama. The only reason I gave it an 8 and not a 9 or 10 is because i wanted more ""standard"" storytelling like a clear hero/villain but that's not what you get with Oppenheimer. It's a wrestling match the whole movie, a storm of intelligence, morality, ego, power, greatness, and love all swept up into one man. Nobody wins when it comes to weapons of mass destruction. Wonderful lines. Historical precision. Robert Downey Jr. Was brilliant."
"This film really had it all. A perfect representation of a such hard to tell historic event. Cillian Murphy plays such a deep and emotional role as Oppenheimer and plays it to perfection. The cgi for the scene where all Oppenheimer could see was people dying from the bomb was amazing and so well done. I'd also like to highlight Emily blunt as one of the best scenes in this movie is her interrogation she completed outsmarted everyone and showed how much she cared for her husband. I hope this films wins many Oscar's including best picture, best lead actor and best director. As it thoroughly deserves it."
"Unlike all his other movies, there are no CGI effects in this Nolan's latest. It does have some well placed visual effects which are even more impressive knowing they are real instead of CGI. If you are lucky to have access to an IMAX 70mm cinema, go. I've seen the aspect ratio is cropped in some other cinemas.Some scenes are in black and white - and if I remember correctly, it's those related to Strauss and his congressional hearing. My interpretation is that those are lifeless moments pertaining to government and bureaucracy as opposed to the achievements of the physicists.There's a large part of the movie dedicating to the physics and setting up the logistics. Some of the science is obviously explained to the audience. And, how many times does Oppenheimer write the board? A few.As a non-American the patriotic overtones ring a bit too much but understandable why they are placed. I didn't know that Los Alamos was developed for the research of the A bomb.The explosion - the first successful test of the atomic bomb - is a triumph of their efforts. But it didn't read as such to the audience or to the protagonist. The silence between the visual presence of the mushroom cloud and the following blast leaves space for agonising moments of anticipation and reflection.Everyone but Oppenheimer (and the audience? Maybe just me) celebrate; after all their efforts paid off. The moment of reflection arrives when they hear the news Japan had been bombed, when it becomes part of reality not physics experiments. Once released into the hands of the army, the creators no longer have any control over their creation. The movie hints at continuity in search of the ultimate bomb as it brings up the possibility of creating an H bomb - which terrifyingly is today's nuclear bomb.In the lead up to the movie I came across a video showing all nuclear detonation tests. There are over 2000 of them. Only 2 were ever used as weapons in war. Otherwise world powers have been bombing the hell out of themselves and I can't help but find irony in endlessly testing such a weapon, in the hopes that is never needed.Oppenheimer gets investigated for political reasons. Can't help but draw parallels between Oppenheimer and Turing, whose governments treated them with scorn following historic achievements. Both only received retractions from officials decades after their demise. Is there perhaps a takeaway here that the government will shield brilliance for as long as they need it and not a second more.Cillian Murphy is excellent. He'll probably be the top contender for an Oscar. Though I daresay Robert Downey Jr steals the show with his performance of a controlling, narcissistic political figure. Younger viewers may only know RDJ as Iron Man but he has always been an excellent character actor, including biographical roles. It's great to see him use these chops again. The black and white reminds me of Good Night and Good Luck, which takes place in the same era, about suspected communists. Brilliant showing from Matt Damon, too, above my expectations. Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are underutilised though Blunt gets a satisfying scene towards the end. There's Kenneth Branagh with a trademark stately showing."
"I can't think of an adequate superlative to describe Nolan's latest masterpiece.Seldom will I rate a motion picture with 10/10 but in this case, it is well-deserved.Cillian Murphy can expect to pick up his Oscar early into 2024 following an exemplary and unrivalled performance.The only thing I couldn't even force myself to enjoy was Emily Blunt's arguably excessive endeavours to portray a character that required much more subtlety.Make yourself comfortable, remove any distractions and enjoy the best 3-hours of your life...Nolan's flawless legacy continues to accumulate speed, and I look forward to his next production."
"This is one of those films where the industry was desperate for summer blockbuster so they stuck a big name director on it and then hyped it for 12 months to create an excitement and anticipation....and the film just doesn't warrant or fulfill that. I think the best way to convey the actual film aside from the circus surrounding it would be that had it not been publicised beyond belief and Nolan not been the director nobody would be talking about it! It's overly long, boring, it doesn't give away any real nuances about RJO's personality or build his character well....or give any real insights...... and they managed make the race to make the atomic bomb boring."
"With the film being available in IMAX and 70 mm formats, there is a promise of large-scale action of some sort. Instead, most of the activity occurs in small rooms, with the most expansive scenes being some of he New Mexico desert.There are too many characters, as Oppenheimer is shown starting from his student days. I can accept the scientists he meets only once, as they are introduced and can be forgotten. However, people like the scientists on his team tend to blur, as they are not given enough screen time each, nor played by big enough stars to meld their faces and characters.At 3 hours, this is a long film. However, the main theme running thru it is a rival scientist who felt humiliated by Oppenheimer, and got revenge by later denying him a continuation of his security clearance, and destroying his reputation. As the U. S. moved into a ""red scare"" period after the Soviet Union detonated its 1st atomic bomb, Oppenheimer's humanism was used against him - his earlier social justice associations with American Communists, and his pacifism after he developed the bomb. The film would have been a lot better if this was greatly abbreviated or eliminated."
Oppenheimer was the on of Christopher's Nolan's masterpieces the movie started slow but at the end you find out why and it shows what the went through how he was turned against his personal life and and all. If I was you though I wouldn't recommend a little kid to see it is has bad language and nudity but if your not a child you would enjoy this movie it was fantastic and the way the bomb felt in theaters was crazy it seemed like it kind of teased a John f. Kennedy spin off but I don't really know the movie had great visuals and the sound was perfect the only thing bad about the movie was it could have shown the real life footage of heroshima.
"Oppenheimer did not disappoint. It told the story of his life, the before and after, the good and the bad. It was just absolutely brilliant. Hands down, would watch it again. The score was beautifully matched to every moment, some scenes were a bit heavy because you can feel how the characters felt. The culminating of actors in the entire movie was surprising, I had no idea that many big name actors were going to be in it, I personally could've done without some he chose, but that didn't stop me from watching and loving every second of the cinematic masterpiece. You can never go wrong with Nolan's story telling, it keeps you drawn to the screen the entire time."
"""Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to man. For this he was chained to a rock and tortured for eternity!""Real controllable power stays in the shadows. Imagine a neutron, despite being the most powerful catalyst to a chain reaction never in its purest form compromises the valency of an atom because its innate nature prevents it from turning rogue. But when it gets triggered by externalities, disaster is bound to happen. The genesis of this externality, an obsessive self induced entitlement to change the world, is well explained in one of the verses from Bhagvad Gita ""Attachment to sensory pleasures often lead a man spiralling into the abyss of lust, lust leads to anger which further develops into delusion al last destroying all intelligence and bringing him back to the material pool of existence devoid of any reputation"".Dr. J Robert Oppenheimer one of the most influential man to ever live, battered by his pride and lost in the relevance of Manhattan Project, was one such raw mind burst open by the endless desire to change the world. But all his creation led to was a traumatic lifelong battle between the uncontrollable power fueled by monumental stature and the subconscious fear of feeling trapped in the gallows of internal turmoil manifested by the consequences of actions. Amidst the political catharsis his stature is well uplifted by Cilian Murphy's divine portrayal who bends and tears every possible aspect of an already perplexed yet hallucinated mind elevating the notion of an American Prometheus.All performances including Ludwig Göransson chilling background score are worth remembering with brilliance written all over. Only caveat lies in Nolan's style of filmmaking who builds the experience purely for IMAX. No theatre less will be able to negate somewhat sluggish screenplay at times. Nevertheless, Oppenheimer with its deep scientific and spiritual connotations, fires every neuron in your body and begs you to think what just detonated on screen? Was it an atom bomb or the future of mankind. Highly Recommended!"
"The best biography movie ever, I don't know where to start, but everything in this movie was great, the voices, the performance of the actors, the music, the directing in manipulating the time line, and the method of narration. I never imagined that I would watch a biographical film with this much enjoyment, even though the film was long, It was three hours, but I did not feel it because it was fast and fun. Everything was great and it is considered an injustice if the movie got less than two Oscar. In the end, I want to say that Mr. Christopher Nolan presented us with a wonderful and unforgettable cinematic masterpiece, and every time he directs a movie, he raises the ceiling of challenges and makes things difficult for the rest of the directors."
"""OPPENHEIMER"" is undoubtedly a huge cinematic achievement. Christopher Nolan perfectly tells the tale of the father of the atomic bomb and puts the audience in his mind.Cillian Murphy absolutely nails it. 10/10 perfect casting and also very intensely acted. He shall take home the Oscar for the best actor. Robert Downey Jr. Delivers a compelling performance as Lewis Strauss and has outdone himself too.It is a dense, dialogue-driven 3 hour film, but I was NEVER bored, even once. It is perfectly paced and kept me hooked right till the end. Masterclass at editing.Nolan also nailed the horrifying imagery and the realization of the true impact of the bomb. It would be nicer if there was more of that imagery. That said, the horrifying images really DO horrify you. Absolutely scarring experience. The rise of tension till the detonation of the bomb and the silence that follows, absolutely heart-pounding.Ludwig Goransson outdoes himself in the music department. I never felt the absence of Hans Zimmer, which says a lot.Absolutely breathtaking cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema. Probably his best work yet. I was thoroughly impressed at how they recreated the detonation without CGI. Also the scenes where Oppenheimer hallucinates are absolutely a masterclass at cinematography - absolutely horrifying images.My only complaint with the film is that I expected a little of those absolutely stunning imagery instead of dialogue. At times, the film becomes overly dialogue-driven.This film definitely deserves Best Actor, Director, Original Score, Cinematography and Editing at the Oscars next year."
"If this doesn't sweep the Oscars for best actor, best supporting actors and best film and possibly cinematography, music and costumes then I don't know will. This film was stunning in its telling of a man, a genius a historical event that shaped the world I am a loss for superlatives.3 hours passed in a moment. I was enthralled the whole time. I am no physicist so was worried the science would confound me but it didn't.Nolan has created a masterpiece. The story telling is perfection the way the time line is juxtapositioned and shot in different textures really helps in understanding.Cillian Murphy fills every scene and strides across it like a colossus. He is sublime.RDJ acts his little socks off bringing such depth and feeling to the character.Matt Damon is also brilliant.I absolutely loved this film it is one of the best films I have ever seen. It was a pleasure and an honour to watch. It challenged my emotions and my intellect. Cannot recommend it highly enough."
"I'm just gonna pour it here since there's none of my fellow friends who has a same genre and i can discuss with about this amazing movie of NolanI love that this movie is Nolan's longest film. In that way, we can conclude that there's just so much that Nolan would like us to watch and experience. And of course, when it comes to Nolan, there's no doubt it'll be that good and I love how Nolan chose Oppenheimer as his first biopic movie. This explains how Oppenheimer actually had the power to destroy the whole world. I don't think people understand that the atomic bomb, in Oppenheimer's theory and case, could be capable of destroying the entire world. I mean, we're talking about a scientifically proven Marvel Infinity Stones planet destroyer here. But in this case, they made it as a destroyer of a city. As some scenes suggest, there's a minor chance (close to zero) that the chain reaction doesn't stop and burns the whole world.I love Oppenheimer's character too. The way he already knew there would always be people like Lewis Strauss, and even if it's not Lewis, it'll be someone else, and he remains calm about that and continues his work, dedicating it to his beloved country of America (unlike other scientists such as Albert Einstein - who, in this case, had already warned Oppenheimer about the tragedy yet to come). Also, how he manages his household with Kitty that can be so much to take, Tatlock. I mean, people can just be perfect in everything. We are used to the type of person who excels in one area or field, and it's just so satisfying to see how Oppenheimer can handle so many areas in his life successfully. The way he felt guilty and kept being honest about the moment he was about to poison his lecturer shows he really has a good character for us to learn from. Additionally, the way he remains calm and is also a social and charming person on the other side of his intelligence.I love that he never lowers his standards and remains humble about everything. Even after what Strauss did to him and his co-worker testifying against him, he still shook their hands and harbored no hate against each other. He was a very objective and reasonable man. I admire the way he innovated about being effective in working on a remote new city while still finding time for refreshment, a bar, and staying in touch with friends and family, reminding us to have a balance in life. Many scientists use this method nowadays. The responsibility he took for building that city and succeeding in making the atomic bomb faster than Russia is truly commendable.Not to mention, watching the era of big influencer scientists in one movie (Oppenheimer, Einstein, Bohr, and many more) is just so pleasing to watch. And of course i love how Nolan's don't make it just a regular biopic movie, but a little plot twist, puzzle, mind blowing, layered plots like this. There's just a neverending talks about this movie. Great job, NolanAnd this is personal, but I love how he hates math 😂."
"A biography class, and when i say ""biography"" i mean it in the most literal sense of the word, without much context about the second war, just oppenheimer and his life story, no time for side stories. It's amazing what ciliam murphy does here in this film, this year we will hardly have another performance that can surpass what he did here. Along with robert downey jr, who initially i thought it would be hard to unlink the iron man image after more than 10 years of marvel, but he delivers something amazing too. The film's script is very dense and challenging, nolan is very criticized by the public for explaining too much ""obvious"" things in his films, as if he was underestimating the public. This does not apply here, oppenheimer's script requires a lot of attention from start to finish, at a certain point it can get tiring due to its 3h duration, however, it is something that the public will have to weigh whether this is a worthwhile experience or not, it is totally personal. Oppenheimer is a film that i will definitely watch again after studying more about the subject, the film managed to awaken my interest in studying about the life of the physicist and the manhattan project, and also to go after the work on which nolan was based to do it. In technical terms the film is perfect, yes, perfect. There is simply nothing to say about the technical part, it is an example, it is pure cinema, it is incredible what is done here, all the ambience created, photography and especially the sound part, audio is always used during the film as part of immersing the story, which was a perfect decision."
"Atomically loud jump scares are littered throughout the film. The film immediately starts with a sudden huge noise then plods quietly through barely discernible dialogue until other sudden huge noises occur regularly to inject adrenalin into the audience. The first hour urgently needs sub titles due to the garbled words. This is strange because the first hour had some scientific theory which, if heard better, would have really added to the film.Sudden irrelevant sex scenes occasionally replace the sudden loud noises obviously to break the monotonous talk fest.Some great acting by both major and minor actors. This saved the film from outright boredom and makes it passable. The theme is of such importance that the talk fest is warranted so we can get a better understanding of those times.The musical score was mainly sudden and loud. Forte forte FORTE."
"Ok - so watched this yesterday. And there's a lot of negative points about this film, but for me the biggest one was the nuclear explosion itself. There's been so much hype over this in not using CGI etc. But. I could have got the same effect by grabbing a can of petrol and lighting it and filming it in slow motion and passing it off as a nuclear explosion. To say it was a bit crap is an understatement! It's a shame that nobody involved in the making of this film looked at actual footage. And it's not like there isn't enough of it about either, so there's no excuse. The story of Oppenheimer is ok. The story of the science is above par. But so so let down by the scenes of trinity. I wanted my 2 hours plus back by the end."
"Simply put, one of the greatest movies ever made as it's a warning to everyone in IT - especially those working on Social Media & AI. It's a cross between Schindler's List & The Imitation Game. Prepare to need to drink heavily after viewing!. You do not wet to see this late in the day as you will think about it for hours afterwards. It is very science heavy and requires you to pay attention. Personally I don't think IMAX is needed for this but absolutely a theatre with good sound is a must. This is not only the best picture of 2023, it's one of the greatest films of all time. But I never need to see it again!"
"First things first, before seeing this movie, set your expectations straight. You will not see high paced action, you will not see an intriguing plotline, you will not see a conventional movie. Rather you see a master-class in acting from an incredibly talented cast.Cillian Murphy's acting is nothing short of phenomenal. He was already incredible before I had seen thus movie, but this just confirms it. The amount of emotion you see in his face and eyes can only be experienced not described. His acting alone had me lost in his character, and the psychology of Oppenheimer.And Nolan's dedication to the art of cinema, recreating the visuals of the explosions without CGI did not go Un noticed, rather knowing that going into the film had me in awe.I repeat, this film is NOT for most audiences. Do NOT expect what you normally expect from a film, rather have an open mind and observe the incredible acting and cinematography."
As soon as I saw the trailer for this from Avatar I was on the hype train for this film. I watched this in Imax last night and I can confirm the hype for this film was real. This is without a doubt the best ive seen in recent memory. Soundtrack could be nolens best. It fit the atmosphere of this film perfectly. The acting is incredible. The story telling is perfectly put together. For 3 hours of dialogue I was engaged frame to frame from this film. This is Cillian Murphys best acting to date. He carries this whole film and all the supporting actors do their job and drag you into the world they are living in. Go see this at the theaters. Whatever sound system you have at home wont do this film justice!
"This is a film, a movie by all means, a great story, it feels like watching the narrative of Citizen Kane, yet, it maintains the speed of an action trailer, a dual twist (I felt) that makes a person sigh, I reached the theater late, and didn't have a chance to get some beverage for the 3 hour movie, however, that didn't matter, as the 3 hours passed within minutes, I am not here to write that Nolan is great, this is not a theory that needs to be advocacy anymore, nevertheless, I am here to say why Nolan is great, and why oppenheimer is a true Nolan movie.The screening was great, the sounds managed to gave goose bumps 👌, the Imax experience awesome, the dialog is a tasteful dessert.. But the real thing is the casting, Nolan is the greatest in this field, he puts the right actor/actress in the right role. First Cillian Murphy, delivered one of his best performances, in this movie he was so relaxed and fitted, he delivered his A game, he got into the character in a way that his eyes were giving a freezing fire looks, cold, yet fear and worry is seen. 10 of 10! Emily Blunt, she is beautiful, but in a grounded way, an elegent lady of the 40s, her acting is so method, she managed to reflect the charchters temper, and the wicked love she had for Oppenheimer. Matt Damon is the joker card of the movie, he is a real actor, delivered a simple honest General, not trying to impress, he gave right dose of greatness and performances. Robert Downey JR. Managed to deliver a great talent, the way he spoke the way he delivered his character, the smile, the anger and the eye rolling, just great! Honestly I am not big fan of Florence Pugh, and I was a bit skeptical about her participation in the movie, nevertheless, after watching it I think i can understand why Nolan choose her, she really fits her role, her character was a bit controversial and maybe that suits her fine.. of course with all due respect to her and her fans!However I must say that I was not fond of the sex scene of the movie, and the extended nude sit down talk between Murphy and Pugh, it is not essential for the story, and Nolan is not fan of scenes of this kind, I mean people can talk in depth with their clothes on! This is why I will give the movie 9 stars. I must say the music is great, and the sounding, to all of those who say Nolan benefited in his career from Hans Zimmer, think again! I think the latter is the one who managed to gain the bigger award of their collaboration.In conclusion, this movie might not be the cup of tea for everyone, but this is a real movie, the vibes of Godfather, Casablanca, 12 angry men, and those really movies that delivered a great story on awesome narrative. Nolan told the story of Oppenheimer, as Oppenheimer wondered, will anyone tell the story of the A bomb.. Nolan answered!THANK YOU CHRISTOPHER NOLAN!"
"I watched it in IMAX with my cousin. I imagined I would be bored at some point of the movie somewhere but the progression of the general plot and the scenario was so smooth I couldn't get the chance to get bored. My cousin said the same thing. Truly one of the greatest cinema experiences of my life. The acting was perfect in my opinion, great actors with great performances, every scene felt like a video clip from the past.Literally every scene looks and feels like you are there watching from the corner. The sets, lighting and the camera work is impecable.Ludwig Görensson wrote the perfect scores for the constantly building up tension and stress throughout the movie.10/10 definitely would watch again and again."
"Deservedly, ""Hoppenheimer"" has attracted a lot of attention from the public and the critic. So far so many people have written about this movie that it is almost impossible to say something new and worthwhile. Therefore I shall concentrate on two points: a (mild) complaint and a remark about form. But first let me state that I rate the film as a successful achievement in every aspect. When I entered the cinema I was afraid I couldn't stand the three hour projection; in the end I was surprised not to have noticed the passage of time.1) The complaint. It seems to me that a certain amount of deception is currently being built about the IMAX format. Almost every IMAX theater uses digital projection, not 70mm film. This may explain why the image seems to lack the very high definition characteristic of that analogue format which subsisted until the seventies. In short, watching a film in IMAX is only a small improvement (bigger screen) with respect to a normal session in a well equipped theatre.2) An assertion. ""Oppenheimer"" is an opera without singing. The prodigious score by Ludwig Goransson pervades the whole action. Or sometimes we should say that the action pervades the score. This is especially remarkable in the final ""third act"", when at some moments the words have to fight to be heard. The music creates a unique, dreamlike, obsessive atmosphere that pulls the spectator to complete immersion. That is why the movie's duration may easily appear shorter."
"See, Oppenheimer is a movie which is about the late scientist's life J Robert Oppenheimer. The story is completely based on his life and nothing's changed from it, if you're expecting an entertainer or a subtle of impressing moments then it's not a cup of tea for everyone. We all know that Nolan's movies like The Batman Trilogy, Inception, Interstellar, Prestige, Tenet and many more movies like that is kinda entertaining, but the point to be noted here is, the movie is entirely different from these movies i've mentioned. From an honest reaction as a movie lover, not as a Nolan fanboy. The first half is literally boring i ain't gonna lie about that. But from the second half the movie completely changes things becomes impressive. But what i understood from this movie is, if you miss a single scene from this movie. You'll get confused as hell. Because one of my friend who came with me was yawning and slept for some minutes. He couldn't keep up with the movie. And I've seen the movie twice first i saw it in an IMAX screen and second i saw it in a normal 4K ATMOS screen. The explosion scenes were pretty good in IMAX compared to the normal, so i wanna say is, if you want a great experience, IMAX is the best choice than 4DX. And if you are expecting Oppenheimer to be a entertaining movie like other Nolan movies then you are wrong. And if you watch with that taste or a mindset you'll feel so embarrassed and will leave the theatre asap."
"After a second rewatch in theaters I believe without a doubt Oppenheimer is peak cinema. It is truly an absolutely astonishing film. This is arguably Christopher Nolan's greatest film (probably my favorite after a second watch). Every aspect of the film is just stunning. The acting, writing, pace, etc is so well done and works perfectly for how the film unfolds. The way each character develops and comes into their own and has their moment is truly amazing. Cillian Murphy delivered one of the best acting performances I have ever seen. He deserves to be claimed as one of the best actors of our time, and he deserves his flowers for this performance. With that being said I was truly blown away by Robert Downey Jr performance as Lewis Strauss. He is absolutely remarkable in this role and knocks it out of the park. I can keep going on but I highly recommend any film lover to watch this film ASAP while it is still in theaters. 10/10."
"One of the most fascinating aspects of the of the current cinematic cultural moment that is ""Barbenheimer"" is how both films have both surprised and disappointed in unexpected ways which has led to some interesting discourse within the film community. Despite both films being vastly different in nature, the pairing would have inevitably resulted in comparison which has led to critique that I think would have been less prominent if they where released separately. Despite both films being flawed epics they are none the less remarkable achievements for both the studios and cinema as a whole.Whilst Barbie has had a greater success due to its populist appeal, Oppenheimer is definitely the better of the two films. Everything from the performances, to the cinematography, to the sound, to the visual effects are produced to an insane level of quality. Cillian Murphy is completely captivating as J. Robert Oppenheimer and has an amazing ability to convey a sense of existential despair. Hoyt van Hoytema proves yet again why he is referred to as the master of IMAX with his remarkable skill to balance the spectacle with the most intimate. Composer Ludwig Göransson's score is both epic in scale and haunting in nature which is further imbued with a dangerous radioactive energy as he combines traditional orchestra music with geiger-counter-esque synthesisers.The film centres around several key moments in Oppenheimers life, from from his time studying and teaching Quantum Mechanics, his work on the Manhattan Project and his later life as a victim of McCarthyism. Whilst technically a biopic it is much more radical the usual fair with a non linear narrative and a bold combination of colour with black and white photography. Its structure is not experimental for experimentation sake but serves a purpose of contextualising quantum theory with practical research and more generally the actions with consequences. It's a film that doesn't progress but unravels and does so with remarkable skill and surprising complexity. You could have a scene thats constantly jumping back and forth from three different time periods but it never feels confusing only sometimes overwhelming. But it's the point of the film to overwhelm. Oppenheimer is a film that is equally about the experience as it is about the plot. It marks a return to an older form of the big motion picture epic that was less cynical as it is now, and was more concerned about an artistic vision than box office profit. Films like 2001 - A Space Odyssey, The Red Shoes and Abel Gance's Napoleon come to mind. More specifically I also find myself reflect on a quote from Stanley Kubrick.""A film is - or should be - more like music than like fiction. It should be a progression of moods and feelings. The theme, what's behind the emotion, the meaning, all that comes later.""This is perfectly sums up the film. It feels more like a symphony or an opera than something more rigid like the usual narrative films. Its also worth noting that I was rather oddly reminded of the David Bowie documentary Moonage Daydream which also has a similar non-linear narrative progression.The film is also very much reminiscent of Greek tragedy and Shakespeare in its melodrama. Throughout the film we see Oppenheimer rise to become ""the most important man on earth"" and then fall from grace. A running theme is the story of Prometheus who famously gave man fire and was punished by the gods for this sin. This deification is further reiterated also see a reference to Oppenheimers interest to Hindu scriptures and of course the famous line ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"". As a film it is in fact quite critical of the Great Man theory as it also deals with the irony on how Oppenheimer became forgotten and was in reality simply a part of a cog of a wider machine.Despite this this it is very much a flawed film. Combination of all of this subject matter results in a rather dense film that doesn't fit cohesively, with some elements that should have had more prominence neglected to the sidelines. This mixed with deification of Oppenheimer is especially problematic from the perspective of the female characters when paired with the feminist themed Barbie. Florence Pugh's character only appears in a sex scene and Emily Blunt only has one scene where she has any real agency. The lack of acknowledgment of what the civilians went through in the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings has been another point of contention. The problems in the film is in my opinion largely a technical one. The secondary male characters also get relegated to one or two scenes. The problem is in fact IMAX. IMAX is the highest quality picture format ever devised for the cinema screen but with that quality comes limitations. IMAX cameras have a reputation of being cumbersome and insanely expensive. These limitation transfer to the projection as an IMAX film reel can become so heavy that that it cannot be carried by the projector equipment. This results in a limit on how long an IMAX film can be. Traditionally this limit is around 2 Hours 30 Minutes but Interstellar managed to extend it by another 10 minutes. For Oppenheimer IMAX has been able to extend the film to 3 Hours. Despite this impressive feat its definitely not enough. It doesn't need to be too long, it just needs more time to flesh out its secondary characters and societal issues (particularly the antisemitism in which Oppenheimer faced). The issues with the time limit can be further seen with the recent controversy where it was revealed that the credits for its visual effects artists had been trimmed down, leaving over 80 percent being uncredited. Whilst the time limit issue was probably the rationale behind it, it's a decision that should not be defended. The motion picture epics of the past, in which this film so obviously draws from solved this issue with an intermission. This would not work for a non-linear film like Oppenheimer but if the Hollywood epic is to make a comeback, this should be a solution worth considering.Overall Oppenheimer is outstanding achievement and definitely worth your time. Despite its flaws its most certainly one the highlights of the year. I've given this film a 4 star rating but if you asked me in several months time I could see myself giving a 5 star."
The screenplay could have been clearer and less confusing. The story should have been told in a linear chronological manner focusing on the creation of the bomb then the communist witch hunt then exoneration. The focus should been less on the interrogation and Robert Downey's character which keeps interrupting the story. Too many characters are introduced and it's hard to keep track of who is who. Should have left out the mistress and the rather gross love scenes. Rather irritating loud strings soundtrack at crucial moments drowns out the dialogue. Typical Nolan. This is unfortunate because the subject matter is fascinating and it does show how scientists helped win WW2.The message in this movie is quite relevant today warning against military build up and confrontation with Russia. Also about how politicians try to discredit those against their policies.
"This movie was shattered into so many pieces but revealed very little as to how the bomb was made. The parts of his life it did go over were more about how Oppenheimer was interrogated because he had communist friends/affair. And even then, it does little to completely go over it all. It is fragmented and split about much like the atom itself.If you want to watch this for scientific value, then this is the wrong movie. Very little is explained going over the actual splitting of atoms and what it took to get there. This is about interrogation, only and it goes back into his life in fragmented bits to try to explain what was happening and fails miserably. At about 30 minutes before the movie ended, we got up and walked out. It was not what I expected at all.Many people are raving about this movie and I honestly do not see it or how or why people would be. It was drivel at best. JMO."
"I think it goes without saying that Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, and one of only a handful who could have pulled off this feat. This is a perfect biopic. The juxtaposition of the three main points of view (the events leading to Trinity, Oppenheimer's security clearance hearing, and the (failed) confirmation hearing of Strauss) were perfectly entwined. The pacing was excellent. It's a pretty solid bet that this will take home many trophies on Oscar night. For me, the sure winner will be Robert Downey Jr. For his nuanced portrayal of Strauss. Well worth seeing on the big screen."
"A lot of mixed emotions about this movie. But what a incredible performance by Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey, Chris Nolan.Enjoyed every part of it. Amazing cinematography, directing and acting.Things I Disliked:Before the Trinity test, Chris Nolan combined about 4 timelines at the same time at a very fast pace. Very complicated, Very confusing and if I didn't have a background on Oppenheimer's case and history I wouldn't have have an idea where this movie is going.Very very complicated storyline chronology. Within minutes you find yourself in different settings/topics and you have to put in the pieces together.Fast dialogue, storyline switching fast, multiple topics at the same time. Even some scenes weren't that important and would not hurt the movie if the narrative was made in order (from beginning of his study to the trial).What was I expecting of Chris Nolan right?But that's just before the trinity test where things got interesting for me.It would have been better if we understood some characters better like Emily Blunts (Kitty Oppenheimer) and Robert Downey Jr. (Lewis Strauss) character's who i find interesting but weren't emphasized and underlined.Things I liked:What a sensational performance by Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Those two are remembered and famous for one role, but in this movie you never thought of them as Thomas Shelby or Ironman. Even the change in sentiment about Strauss after the second part was great. Emily blunt was great regardless of the fact the I think her character wasn't emphasized that much. I felt like her amazing performance at her scene at the end of movie made it like we know everything about her and her personality relating to her husband.This was one of my best experiences in cinema regarding visual and sound effects. Can't limit this to a certain scene. Enjoyed every second of it. Didn't even feel the 3 hours.Bravo Chris Nolan."
"A great story about one of 20th century's greatest scientists. Sadly, later in his career he ran up against the world of dickhead politicians and basically lost. The ""hearing"" where his security clearance is NOT renewed his a kangaroo court in the extreme. The only consolation you feel for him is when Robert Downey Jr's character gets knocked back too. You understand how someone realised later how wrong this act was (for Oppenheimer) and posthumously restored it, but only in 2022. Still, these are small points. Great cast and great story. Locations used very well, making you realise the existence at Los Alamos was pretty grim."
"Christopher Nolan's latest masterpiece, Oppenheimer narrates the most horrifying historical truth and an exceptional scrutiny. Robert Oppenheimer acts under a purely genius mind to build the atomic bomb, focusing merely on theory with paying almost no attention to the deadly consequences. In the aftermath of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki apocalypse, he makes his best to clear his conscience. Oppenheimer stands out as one of the most important films of this season. There may be a single flaw comes along with Nolan's choice of nonlinear story telling which mixes the power of the catharsis effect. Nevertheless giving Christopher Nolan's filmography, we are lucky to have such brilliant director following the paths of Kubrick."
"Firstly, the cast was AMAZING! Each one perfect for their respective roles. Nolan really went all out with this one folks!From Gary Oldman to Robert Downey, the cast was filled with the top hollywood stars.J. Robert Oppenheimer.Cillian was brilliant as always playing the famous physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, a complex and sophisticated man filled with regret who died believing that he was the reason the human race would possibly end itself. Cillian perfectly captures Oppenheimer's guilt. We see his culpability after jean's death, just imagine how he would've felt after little boy and fat man.A dissimilar Nolan film.This movie is unlike any other Nolan film. It unveils the true horrors of mankind. The fast pace keeps the audience at the edge of their seats. The intense soundtrack perfectly matches with the pace of the film.The only regret I'm have is that I didn't watch it in IMAX."
"My rating is based on the experience I had(duh!!). I should say, my expectation were larger than the h bomb itself. The xenon IMAX experience i can say was sub par and that seriously affected my viewing experience. Nevertheless the tightness of the dramatic story telling made me hooked to the screen with unflinching attention. Not even the loud snoring of my neighbouring seat fella could divert my attention. Cilian's best performance till date and an equally matchingnone by RDJ too. The movie rightly leaves an afterthought which is indeed a horror of sorts. Nothing so visibly horrific, but an underthemenof horror in it's telling. I seriously wish I had a 70 mm IMAX in my country to experience this in it's full glory. Defenitely missed out on that part. Nolan's take on a biopic in his narrative style and prowess of movie making defenitely makes this one of the best biopics in the history of cinema. I am itching for a re-watch in a better IMAX screen."
"For me, this is not the best I've seen but it's definitely a masterpiece. Nolan is indeed a genius! I love the screenplay. The lines are clean and strong, still able to communicate with the audience despite of so many scientific terms and I am always in awe on how Nolan include humor on some of the lines. The cinematography of this movie is so good which makes you feel lucky to have seen it. Watching it on IMAX made the theatrical experience more immersive and engaging.However, this movie is not for everyone. If you are not into History, or Science or Christopher Nolan's works..you won't probably like this at and it'll be a snoozefest for you. The story is well delivered but I suggest that you read/watch a lot about The Manhattan project first if you're someone like me, j a regular and not so intelligent person who loves Nolan's work. Nolan uses his mind-boggling time manipulation trademark again so better to have a background knowledge about it.The movie is also 180 minutes long..3 hours! But, they still manage to get their audience's attention and focus from the beginning to the end. The casts delivered their characters very effectively. All of them..no matter how big or small the role, they nailed it. Cillian's performance is undeniably extraordinary. The musical score is great too..it really makes you feel the movie more.Overall, it's really good. There are just scenes that are so weird and disturbingly off for someone who watches from a conservative country(PH). I somehow wished that those shouldn't be included.Still, this is the best cinematic experience that I had in my whole life and it was my first time to watch in an IMAX theatre so it's mind-blowing."
"In one of Christopher Nolan's best works to date, Oppenheimer provides us with a real life ""Kobayashi Maru."" And while the director pulled out all the stops to pull us into the heart and mind of the ""Father of the Atomic Bomb,"" it's the ensemble of actors performing at their highest level that drives the movie home into our hearts and minds.Feeling like three movies rolled into one, it can get heavy. While it's not all doom and gloom, the tension is there throughout the entire three hours, so the audience member may feel a bit worn out at the end. Before and after the famed Trinity Test in Los Alamos, New Mexico, the story revolves around the controversial leader of the Manhattan Project, J. Robert Oppenheimer. I say controversial because of his mix of political activism, personal indiscretions, and the quiet arrogance of a genius who, despite the availability of icons like Niels Bohr and Albert Einstein, really has no one to turn to for advice on how to end the war without ending humanity as we know it.The jealousy of other people take their toll on him, particularly after the Japanese surrender and he is deemed a hero to many around the world, but he allows the punishment to go one. Is it penance for being the ""Destroyer of Worlds?"" We may never truly know, but what appears clear is how haunted he was by what can be considered his greatest achievement.Nolan mixes a variety of techniques to convey the characters' motivations, convictions, or just basic feelings of vulnerability and despair. Cillian Murphy can finally take his place among the A-List of Hollywood leading men, while Robert Downey Jr gave perhaps his best performance (no, I'm not exaggerating) as a character actor, the Salieri to Murphy's Mozart.In an embarrassment of riches, Nolan had a slew of the best actors around in this project, to the point where a couple of Oscar winners just had cameos. On top of that, Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt gave their usual shine to raise the bar even further, showing that Oppi had more than one no-win scenario to contend with.I will definitely see it again in the theater. There is a lot to chew on in this movie, so I'll enjoy picking up on things the second time. While I wasn't a fan of Dunkirk or Tenet, and I was about to hop out of the Christopher Nolan fan bus, Oppenheimer brought me right back on board."
"Visuals, fantastic. Acting, great. Plot, lacklustre. Was a long watch being 3+ hours, could definitely have been portrayed closer to 2 hours instead. There's a lot of talking and for me, not enough concentrating on the physical creation of the bomb (which would break up all the talking scenes). I also didn't really notice a massive difference in IMAX to that of a standard showing, bar the 'bomb' scene. It's a worth a watch once but won't go back for a second viewing. Definitely my least favourite film from Nolan unfortunately.Also a little worrying seeing these 'best film ever watched' reviews! I know the 2023 standard of films has been poor but still!"
"Watched it in IMAX on first day.Before the movie, I've read through the WIKI page about Oppenheimer to be in picture of his work. It might have been a mistake cause feels like the movie gives nothing new, personal than summary on wiki page.The lazy montage for the explosion is just the top of the iceberg. The movie itself is dragged out, straight up boring in some parts so that they tried quick cutting, through dialogues, time and space, which makes it incoherent, rigid, shallow. Same for the characters.I understand this movie is called Oppenheimer, but director should have been aware, the bigger picture is not Oppenheimer, but the making of and the consequence of the bomb to humanity. It's not about his wifes, or accusations. It should not have been a soap opera, dammit.This movie is so inconsiderate of the consequences of the bomb, so incapable of drawing responsible conclusions that I now realize why it had to be hyped together with Barbie movie, also why it had to be advertised by Nolan as great IMAX movie (not a chance). It had to be sold as lightweight as Barbie movie. Unfortunately for the sales man, a couple nude scenes ruined the image."
"You see a 20-year-old guy's first review who ""hates"" math, physics, and philosophy but is an enormous history enthusiast. The movie is brilliant and breathtaking; you don't even notice spending 3 hours in a movie theater. However, it must be emphasized that for those who are not familiar with history or are not interested in it, it might be a difficult watch. There were times when I found it a bit boring as well, especially during the physics and philosophical scenes. As for the negligible parts, removing them wouldn't have been a problem, and in return, the movie would have been a bit shorter, but there was no chance that it would change my view of this masterpiece. The acting and cinematography were not just perfect but some of the best I've ever seen, and I've seen quite a few things despite my age. Both the music and the visual effects were professional, as one would expect from Nolan's direction. They were never out of place, and the quantity was just right. There's no way to nitpick in this movie. Definitely in the top 3 from Nolan's works.I hope there will be more films in the topic that come close to this one."
"For me, this film cements Christopher Nolan's place among the greats of cinematic directors. Oppenheimer has built a heavy weight of expectation yet it grasps with both hands its opportunity to wow viewers.As a big fan of all of Nolan's work previous work to varying degrees, I too was hopeful of being treated to a box office marvel and I leave the theatre feeling quenched of that thirst. As always I was impressed with the technical qualities of Nolan's work, his insistence on practical effects over CGI continues to deliver results too often lacking in films by his contemporaries.The film was considered and showed admiral constraint in its use of shock and horror on a subject that could have otherwise delved into a macabre tale of gore seeking cheap engagement. Oppenheimer told a narrative of political drama as explosive as anything else on display which served as a fascinating allegory for the concept of mutually assured destruction. Set to the backdrop of an era of post-war anti-communism and McCarthyism, this piece tells a complex story of one of the most influential people in history and exhibits the internal conflicts within his life, attempting to explain his motivations and views.The cast is stacked with talent, with notable cameos from a wide range of big names. I was thrilled to see Cillian Murphy cast as the leading man in a Hollywood blockbuster and he delivered a brilliant performance capable of exquisite expression and conflict. Robert Downey Jr provided a nice reminder to the world that he is capable of much more than Marvel and Matt Damon produced a solid outing as usual. Florence Pugh, in a more limited role than touted, graced the screen with her presence and I'd like to shout out Benny Safdie and Jason Clarke, both of whom I always thoroughly enjoy watching.Minor criticisms include a feeling that at times the pacing lost some of the tension that Nolan was building too with shots perhaps cut too abruptly. I don't think some of the stylistic choices landed with much of an effect and at times the plot felt confusing. I always feel that 3 hour run times are superfluous, though I'm conflicted here as I also could have enjoyed another hour of the story which enjoyed an addictive quality.For me, this film draws together the best of Nolans' precious works, particularly those more grounded in reality like Dunkirk and Memento, with the end result being one of the most complete films I've had the pleasure of watching.10/10."
"Best film Nolan has made. This is his masterpiece and it's beautifully brought to life by an outstanding cast. Cillian Murphy is on his way to an Oscar nomination.It's a great collage of the life of Oppenheimer, and we ho through the process of creating the A bomb with him. While 3h long, the time kind of stops, and the photography and sound effects keep you completely glued to the screen. Extremely engaging, smart and compelling movie. The bomb test scene is one of the best cinematic experiences you'll see - no one in the theater daredevil's to move or breathe.And I love how Nolan doesn't play heroes. There's (obviously) a moral dichotomy in all the ordeal, and he masters it. Oppenheimer is not the fully bad guy or the fully good guy. He's human.This is what cinema is supposed to feel like, and Oppenheimer has brought it back to life."
"It was nice to see a film made for people past puberty. Even better was the acting - while some 'stars' were recognizable,others submerged their personal to the story. The story was ambiguous, as was the history and the impact on the world. And the opening, which tries to convey thought per se, is stunning. I saw the 35mm film, which was how the director wanted it to be shown and the imagery was overwhelming; merely imagining living with these thoughts is humbling.There is no gore or bloodshed, no overt violence, just the barbarism of humans, whether from incinerating weapons or devastating pieces of paper, or calculated betrayal and jealousy. This is the best film of the year."
"I would understand why there are people disappointed in the drama heavy 3 hour movie calling it boring. It's okay to not meet expectations, but watching this in iMax 70mm upon second viewing, you care to think whether those disappointed would have changed their mind if they viewed this marvel of a movie in the intended screen and aspect ratio as nolan intended.I also think nolan has slowly revolutionalized the general movie goers expectation by creating peak cinema. No reason big blockbusters are flopping. Hopefully, we get more movies shot on film and broadcasted in format which although is expensive, is necessary to revive general people going to cinema rather than escape the comforts of their home."
"This film exceeded my expectations. I have never felt so alive, attentive and engaged in a film for three hours in so long. I have to give it ti Mr Nolan, he has created yet again, another masterpiece of a film. I also should point out the music. As much as I thin Hans Zimmer is one of the greatest composers, Ludwig Göransson couldn't have done a better job than he did on Oppenheimer. The score mad meme feel ways I have never felt before, and the build up to the trinity test was an experience I wish I could endure again for the first time. Everyone should see this film, it is what cinema and storytelling is all about, and this (as a filmmaker myself) has boosted me to be more imaginative."
"Mr. Nolan returns to the silver screen with an epic and thrilling biopic about famed physicist Dr. OPPENHEIMER, who was primarily known as the father of the atomic bomb. This is Nolan at his most scientific and political, it feels grown up and intelligent, while retaining the exciting pacing, editing and musical scores that he has become known for.While this movie is heavy on science and theory, it never felt like it was too hard to follow, as long as you are paying close attention. It is a dialogue heavy film, more so than many of his previous films, and one could easily get lost if not giving the film your full attention. This is refreshing for a summer blockbuster, and as always Mr. Nolan respects his audience and doesn't necessarily dumb anything down for the masses.The cast is led by an absolutely stellar Cillian Murphy, who rightly is receiving praise from all angles. He is consistently subtle with his acting from start to finish. I felt like perhaps we could of had one big ""Oscar reel"" scene with him, but he delivers a fantastic performance nonetheless and should absolutely be nominated for Best Actor. It is a delight to see this man lead such a heavy hitting cast after being a supporting player in Nolan's films for so long.Robert Downey Jr. Also delights as Lewis Strauss. His return to dramatic acting reminds everyone what a formidable actor this man is with the right director and script behind him. He is calculating and explosive at times, and is perhaps the standout in the supporting category. Matt Damon also impresses as the army General responsible for overseeing the nuclear project. He has some of the best lines in the film and I was happy to see how much screen time he received. Honorable mention also to the always consistent Jason Clarke.The cast continues on and on with well known faces filling almost every role there is. Nolan pulled no punches here and I would not be surprised if the cast received a SAG ensemble nomination or potentially a win.Special mention must go to Ludwig Göransson for the films musical score. It perfectly accentuates the nerve wracking and terrifying subject matter while also having that sense of wonder, almost cosmic in its sound at times. The score is a major part of the films energy and plays often, which some may find distracting but I found it to keep the film moving at a brisk and exciting pace as these scientists race against time.Overall, this film is a resounding success for Mr. Nolan in my opinion. He is firing on all cylinders here and you can tell he is passionate about the subject matter. The runtime felt adequate for me and I was glued to the screen for every minute. One of his best yet. 9/10."
"Upon finishing the movie, I found myself utterly captivated and emotionally stirred by the profound experience it offered. The three hours of cinematic brilliance seemed to pass by in the blink of an eye, leaving me yearning for more, as if I had just embarked on an exhilarating journey that I was not yet ready to leave behind. The movie's ability to evoke such powerful sentiments in me is a testament to the mastery of its creator, Christopher Nolan, whose direction and visionary storytelling left an indelible mark on my soul.This film may not be easily comprehensible to the masses, but it holds a profound significance for those who delved deeper into its layers, revealing the underlying meanings and reflections on the current state of our world. Through its intricately woven narrative and thought-provoking themes, the movie becomes a powerful mirror that reflects the complexities and nuances of our society. It challenges us to question the trajectory of humanity, the consequences of our actions, and the choices we make as individuals and as a collective.Cillian Murphy's performance as a lead actor was nothing short of phenomenal. With his exceptional acting skills, he effortlessly breathed life into his character, infusing it with charisma, vulnerability, and depth. His ability to convey emotions with such authenticity and visual eloquence drew me into the character's journey, making it impossible for me to break away from the unfolding narrative.One aspect of the movie that left an indelible impression on me was the portrayal of Oppenheimer. The character seemed to transcend the screen, lingering in my thoughts long after the movie had ended. This enigmatic and enigmatic figure became a symbol of the intricate nature of humanity, reminding me of the dualities that exist within us all-the potential for both creation and destruction, innovation and devastation. Oppenheimer's presence in the film served as a poignant reminder of the delicate balance between progress and responsibility, a timeless lesson that resonates deeply with the current state of the world.As I reflect on the cinematic masterpiece that unfolded before my eyes, I cannot help but marvel at the craftsmanship of the entire production. The mesmerizing visuals, the haunting soundtrack, and the meticulously crafted screenplay come together seamlessly to create an immersive experience that transcends the boundaries of conventional storytelling. It is evident that every aspect of the film was thoughtfully considered and meticulously executed, contributing to the overall impact and leaving a lasting impression on its audience.In conclusion, this movie is more than just entertainment; it is a work of art that provokes introspection, stimulates the mind, and stirs the soul. It serves as a poignant reminder of the power of cinema to delve into the complexities of the human experience, urging us to look beyond the surface and engage with the profound ideas it presents. I am grateful to have had the privilege of witnessing this cinematic gem and will undoubtedly carry its impact with me for a lifetime."
"Christopher Nolan, the brand, picks up an Oppenheimer's biography where he narrates the days leading up to building the atomic bomb and the repercussions of dropping two of them on the two cities of Japan. Narrated in flashbacks via two simultaneous hearings, taking us through one man's guilt trip once he understands the politics surrounding him. Though exhausting, the story of the man becoming the destroyer of the worlds is equally exciting.The lengthy runtime does take a toll as the narrative resorts to being non-linear aka Nolan style. Oppenheimer no doubt is a heavy film, high on emotions. It is an out and out drama, where the first half is entirely dedicated to documenting Oppenheimer's personal life and him heading the Manhattan Project. It is the second half focusing on the hearings that provides the high moments. The scene where David Hill testifies and the conversation with Albert Einstein stood out.The terrific performance by Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, firmly aided by a strong supporting cast helped Nolan's vision come into life on screen. The screenplay indeed offers too much to digest and I wished the love affair of Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock was explored a bit more. Same goes for the relationship of Oppenheimer and Kitty though she gets to own a major scene. The pace is uneven but once the drama unfolds, it remained gripping."
"Three hours of my life I wish I could get back.Feels as though they are trying to cram War and Peace into 3 hours of boringness.Too many characters for any meaningful character development. This movie tries to be a love story, a war story, a science documentary, and a biography all wrapped up in one enchilada oofa mess. I felt no sympathy for any of the characters because the only one on the screen long enough to get to know was Oppenheimer himself.The part where they detonate the bomb was interesting so be sure to tell your friends to wake you up when that part starts and then again when the lights come on."
"This was my highest anticipated movie of the year and it absolutely met my expectations. Long runtime, but to me, it didn't feel like it dragged at all due to the fast pacing of the movie. Movie should be nominated for several awards including best actor, supporting actor, cinematography, score, director and film. Do not go into this expecting a typical Christopher Nolan film like the dark knight or inception, this is telling the story of Oppenheimer and his life and development of the bomb. But for a movie with no action at all, I felt gripped from beginning to end and that's why Nolan is showing that he's one of the best directors to do it. And when the bomb drops.....oh wow, the tension was through the roof! A lot of reviews have been stating ""most important film of the decade"" they may be right. This and the Dark Knight, are my two favorite Nolan films, but this may be his defining masterpiece."
"Oppenheimer is undoubtedly a contender for the best movie of the year, probably the decade so far, maybe even movie of the 21st century given the current significance of nuclear warfare. I'm going to be completely honest and disclose that I had never seen a Christopher Nolan film at a cinema before (a crime, I know) and my socks were blown off.The cinematography is great, the soundtrack is excellent, the script is great and the pacing of this mammoth 3 hour movie is pretty much perfect. For those that don't know, this movie follows a certain structure where we see an accusation of one description or another levelled against Oppenheimer and then we are shown a flashback where the details of said accusation are explored. By the end of these flashbacks, a new plot point enters, leading to another accusation against Oppenheimer, and rinse repeat. This is the pattern of the first hour and a half of the film and it results in a perfect flow of information for the audience. I'm a keen historian, but I had little to no knowledge of Oppenheimer outside of his status as the perceived father of the nuclear bomb, and yet the film never overwhelmed me to the point where I couldn't understand what was happening. Well done script writing team.Also, the acting in this film is absolutely off the scale incredible. I've been a fan of Cillian Murphy for years thanks to his role as Tommy Shelby on Peaky Blinders and he stars in this film as the titular character. I really hope this film brings him an Oscar, he truly deserves it for how he portrays the mentally frail Oppenheimer. Robert Downey Jr's performance as Lewis Strauss is a slow burner thanks to how the revealing of information is structured but by the end of the film I was in awe of his egotistical, enraged character who was aware he was on the brink of a loss of all he'd worked for. Matt Damon is a load of fun in this film which surprised me, Tom Conti as Albert Einstein is utterly brilliant, and Florence Pugh (despite her lack of screentime) is also exceptional. However, that leads me on to my main (and pretty much only) complaint with this film.I really didn't buy much into Oppenheimers romantic life in this film. Murphys chemistry with Pugh was exceptional and the scenes they have together are great. However, there aren't enough of them, and therefore Tatlocks suicide falls a little bit flat. The actress who plays Kitty (apologies for forgetting her name) also unfortunately provides the one performance in the film I struggled to buy into due to her occasionally brash line delivery and slight stiffness interacting with other actors. She wasn't bad, but she certainly made my sympathy for her discovery of the Tatlock affair a bit limited.(Also, the way this film finishes, I was fully expecting Murphy to deliver the famous ""i am death, destroyer of worlds"" quote for the third time in the film when it cuts to black and he didn't. Would've ended the film excellently but never mind)However, this minor complaint pales in comparison to my praise for the film. Its really good and a sure fire contender for all Oscars. It could perhaps have been better if the last 45 minutes of the movie were streamlined allowing for more development of Tatlock and Kitty as characters within the 3 hour runtime but at the end of the day, I don't really mind too much. Definite must watch!"
"Nolan again nails it and that too in a completely unchartered genre. No science but just complexities of human society. Beautifully woven. Every actor was spot on. Initially, I was wondering why Robert Downey Jr. Accepted this role but then in the last couple of scenes and I was like who better than him to play that ego-centeric maniac.Again, Matt Damon who had the tiniest of character and role but whatta an impact. The couple of scenes in which he has portrayed himself as the one in charge for use of the destructive tool is fabulous.Cillian Murphy has left an impact since Peaky blinders and he does justice to the role. The scene you mentioned, it is like while you have a storm inside you, you are deaf from your ears. This is like ""Nolan"" has captured the essence so well.Rani Malek, I guess after Bohemian I watched him now and his couple of minutes role as Hill is fantastic. His was there yet he wasn't there throughout the movie but he is the one responsible for this mystery around Oppenheimer.Then the subtle comparison between Einstein and Oppenheimer, two of the greatest."
"Hard to concentrate on the fast moving but perfectly constructed screenplay as Cilligan's azure eyes are possibly more mesmeric than Peter O'Toole's Laurence. He displays the contradictions 'Oppie' perfectly; the scientist, the agitator, the womanizer, the friend. Despite not knowing a positive proton if it bit me, the film is highly doable, and the whole cast delivers on drama and character, thete's not one bum note. Aside from the main lead, there are stellar turns from Robery Downey Jr., Matt Damon, & Emily Blunt, the first I might say, should garner some quality nominations and it's a joy to see this actor clearly working at the top of his game. You should enjoy this film very much."
"The cinematography is fascinating. The acting is brilliant. Murphy is astonishing. I knew he was great but this I did not expect. The pace is completely on point. Unbelievable how so much intense and relevant information gets dropped in seamless conversations. I consume so many series and films that I sometimes forget what makes movies truly great. Compared to everything I have seen in the last 2 years, this is a complete masterpiece. Even though it is very long, I feel like Christopher Nolan never loses the viewers attention. The only down part to me is, it is not a movie you can enjoy more than once. But other than that. Loved it."
"Oppenheimer is a great biopic about the father of the atomic bomb from Christopher Nolan. The actors do a great job making these historical characters feel real. The movie has great build up and suspense. From the countdown of the actually atomic bomb test or Oppenheimer rushing to his classroom to prevent a teacher from eating a poisoned apple, this movie doesnt leave you bored.Speaking of the atomic bomb test the explosion which was simulated with pure practical effects and no CGI is outright gorgeous spectacle.The story goes deep in the aftermath of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings and how that influenced Robert Oppenheimer his personal life."
"""Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to man. For this, he was chained to a rock and tortured for eternity.""
""I am become death, the destroyer of worlds""
These are two tag lines from Christopher Nolan's excellent Bio-pic, Oppenheimer, which I saw yesterday. Perhaps the best and most important film made in the last 100 years That is to say, ever! Must see in IMAX! Highest quality, both for sound and visuals. The acting was superb. Cillian Murphy was excellent as Oppenheimer and Robert Downey Jr. Gave perhaps the best performance of his career. One should never forget two things. There are warring nations on Earth right now that have nuclear weapons capable of destroying the world and wiping out civilization. And the other thing is The United States is the only country in the world to drop an atomic bomb on another country. The targets were cities populated by civilians. It is debatable whether this heinous act saved lives or ended the war. But one thing for sure is that tens of thousands of people were instantaneously incinerated and thousands more died of radiation poisoning. This is a heavy burden to carry as an American and as Oppenheimer himself said, we have blood on our hands. Go see this movie!"
"Christopher Nolan has been known for making great films, from The Prestige to TDK Trilogy to Inception to Interstellar and now Oppenheimer.Oppenheimer is about Robert J. Oppenheimer and the invention of The Atom Bomb and the aftermath of the bombing. Cillian Murphy plays the protagonist with a great ensemble of supporting Cast. Murphy as Oppenheimer was just PERFECT. The acting, the delivery of dialogue, the emotions, were just perfect. The Supporting Cast of Emily Blunt, RDJ and Matt Damon, each played their respective roles beautifully, each gave their 100%. Props to the Casting Director for casting the perfect actor for each role. Loved Jack Quaid as Richard Feynman playing Banjos and Rami Malek as David Hill. Malek with like 10-15 mins of screentime stole the show for me. Everyone was great.Some of the shots in Oppenheimer were breathtaking and Hoyte Van Hoytema deserve all the praise.One of the aspects of the film which stood out was the Music. Ludwig's music was scintillating. The film was 3 hours long but with Ludwig's Music, it didn't feel that long or boring. Had me on the edge of my seat.As a phsyics nerd myself, watching Oppenheimer recruiting the other physicist felt like Nick Fury recruiting the superheroes for the Avengers. Haha :)
Now, to answer if Oppenheimer is Chris Nolan's Magnum Opus, for me, personally NO. The Dark Knight and Interstellar are stil Nolan's best film. Oppenheimer might make it to the Top 5 list.To conclude, I'd say, Oppenheimer is one of the best films of 2023 till now. Is it a must watch? Honestly no. If you are someone who watches films for entertainment or fun, Oppenheimer may not be for you. But still, who am I say what you should watch and what not."
"3.5 out of 5 stars.Oppenheimer is a pretty fair biographical thriller film about Robert Oppenheimer and his invention of the nuclear bomb.First of all it is a Christopher Nolan film which he delivers a non linear story structure which follow Oppenheimer. And than a black and white sequence which follows Lewis (Robert Downey Jr.) perspective. It is a strong biographical film. Nolan mastered himself at telling the story with a moving script.The film builds the suspense with Oppenheimer rising to building the first nuclear bomb. After the first bomb test which does fail to be cinematic or spectacular that the direction tries to aim for.Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, and the rest of the cast ensemble did great. It does have a variety of familiar faces. The performance is great.What disappointed with the film is the film drags after the bomb test. It flashes between sequences with Lewis testifying against Oppenheimer. Talks of him being a communists or a spy. It just falls into one long hour of back and forth talk of his side of story and Lewis. It falls very flat. Especially it is a three hour film. The suspense and build up leads to a disappointment of one long dull film.Nolan tries to entertain the audience with his loud music or noise in the background of thumping noises or flashes of the atoms exploding. The music score was also okay but nothing special. I am a huge Chris Nolan fan of all his films. This film falls right with Insomnia with being the weakest. It has a great cast and story. And direction. The script falls flat in the last hour which is more frustrating viewing than actually watching a strong film.Oppenheimer is an okay film and a one time watch kind of movie and forgotten after it ends. I was a little disappointed."
"Everything in the movie is okay such as acting, set design, makeup, cinematography etc. Except the story line. The film actually consists of two storylines, the first b the process of making the atomic bomb and the second Oppenheimer's loyalty trial. More than that, the film was going in many parallel timelines which was involved in each other and trying to make more complicated but still the film is still smooth and without any peak point. The atomic explosion was not what we expected and there was nothing special about it. Florence Pugh had marvelous acting, but those rate R scenes badly overshadow her acting. And those scenes were unnecessary and not up to Nolan's style."
"Having loved Cillian Murphy for his portrayal as Thomas Shelby from Peaky Blinders, I was so thrilled when I first heard he would be playing Oppenheimer. I think I first heard about it in 2021, or 2022, either way I couldn't wait to watch this movie. And I am sooo impressed with how it turned out. Though long, it kept me captivated all throughout. I didn't want to miss a minute. Excellent performances by Blunt and Downey but of course Cillian stole the show for me. What an incredible performance as Oppenheimer. I'm so glad that Cillian is finally receiving the recognition he SO DESERVES. If he had social media I'd be spamming him telling him how amazing he is lol.I truly pray he gets an Oscar for his role. He genuinely deserves it."
"Oh my god this is the best movie I have ever watched , every thing is a masterpiece from directing to audio editing and the soundtrack obviously , and Christopher Nolan pushed the limits with his talent and passion , and the cast has Robert Downey Jr. Which he played his character with great talent after he played Ironman for a decade , and Cillian Murphy killed it in this movie and he finally deserved the role of a life time after his association with Christopher Nolan from previous movies , but the thing is I think you should absolutely watch this film. It's one of the best movies ever and you have to watch it in IMAX film or with laser , it's gonna be an experience and this movie is the movie of a decade and it's an experience not just movie. I'm just gonna end this right here. Thanks for reading."
"Absolutely brilliant acting, cinematography, direction and storytelling. Nolan at his very best!As with all Nolan movies, it pays respect to the intelligence of its audience, but in return requires their full attention. He has managed create a thriller out of a biography.The use of the orchestra and music to portray Oppenheimer's inner conflicts at certain specific moments is simply genius. This movie is art at its finest. The way the thoughts and moral conflicts are visualised is simply a masterclass in filmmaking.Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey jr. Were simply brilliant, but each and every actor performed their role to perfection.At 3 hours long, the movie is so gripping that one doesn't realise the length at all."
"First of all, English is not my first language, So sorry if I'm not clear. Anyways,the movie is such a masterpiece though he is 3h. With those 3h I think Nolan could cut a few seconds or two minutes. But the movie is so good. The cast, the effects the sound, I specifically watched the movie in Imax, which made the experience a lot more better with the sound and the big screen, Cillian Murphy's performance in the movie was insane. It just felt so real. I think. Cillian and Christopher definitely deserves a oscar for this movie. When I watched the movie it didn't felt at all like a 3h one minute I got into the cinema and one minute the movie has ended. Actually I didn't accept for the movie to be so good. Before the movie I thought it would suck like a movie I've watched a few months ago, I just left this movie before a half hour of it, but in Oppenheimer it was different, the act of all the cast was insane. The effects were so good and realistic. And the sound literally blow my mind. As soon as the movie has come out I told my friend ""we are going to this movie, whether you want to or not."" He also thought the movie was great, I think it is definitely deserve a watch. But I gave it 9/10 because Nolan could make it shorter in my opinion, but without the 3h the movie is definitely a 10/10 even with the fact the movie is 3 hours, it is definitely deserves a watch!. As I said in the title, Christopher Nolan never disappoints."
"Only reason why this isn't 10/10 is that for me the camera work is too ""dramatic"". Every 2 seconds the camera shifts and every 3 minutes new scene begins. If the movie wasn't 3h long I would say that I would prefer if they prolonged the scenes and added more detail. I also understand that this works the best when a character is retelling his story and memories, but for me it was a bit too much.Also the huge amount of face close-ups could have been avoided.But except that, I really enojed this movie. The acting, visuals and most important the sound were excellent.(Sorry for my bad English)"
"Pros:Engaging .Loved the awesome performances,
the buildup audio , the uncertainty of the test , and the delving into the flawed lead character , back and forth time line.You can really feel the duality in the mind of this central character. Oscar !!Cons: couldn't connect with /delve into any character outside of the lead. Despite mind blowing performances.All the great minds were just there. Not given any meat outside of Teller and Bohr
Footage wasted on nudity could have been better used elsewhere
Emily Blunt -Kitty story- being the wife -should have had more to it than just awesome acting.Don't understand the hype over not using CGI. The uncertainty ,the acting , and the buildup audio carried the scene which was visually a dud in my mindIt feels as though Nolan doesn't care what you think. He just wants to tell a story with laser focus on every thing happening around Oppenheimer and how he feels with a message at the end."
"OPPENHEIMER...an incredible movie. The word that comes to mind is 'scary'. He builds and builds and builds an endlessly paced, elaborate, intricate historical drama until Nolan knocks the hammer down in the most surprising, shocking way.Oppenheimer is the kind of biopic that only Christopher Nolan could make. Indeed, this film seems like the ideal vehicle for Nolan's career to explore humanity's black holes-the last riddles of a terribly intelligible world.Cillian Murphy gives an outstanding performance as Oppenheimer with the half-smile and secrecy of an intellectual womanizer, which makes it fascinating and multi-layered.A film full of endless contrasts and contradictions, Oppenheimer is the director's best expression of her art to date ... Definitely the best and most inspiring film in Nolan's career."
"There were awesome 3 hours in cinema. Although the film was so long, it was passing quickly, sometimes too quickly. Because of short shots, some quotes or events might not be fully captured by the audience.From the technical point of view, Oppenheimer is as great as different Christopher Nolan's movies. Thrilling soundtrack and excellent cinematography affect the viewers.Directing, in the most important moments, is outstanding and impressive.Cillian Murphy played his best in this movie.From supporting roles, the best one was Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss. He was really charismatic in his problematic role.I think female characters weren't used well. They weren't very important to the story.For me, the biggest positive surprise was screenplay and storytelling. Most of the characters were developed. The story provided emotions. Also, relations of scientists with army and politicians were well written. There were some brilliant ironic scenes about it.One of the best Nolan's works, I recommend to everyone."
"When I walked out of the cinema I felt anguish and fear. With the push of a button all human race will just be vaporized.The fact that this is not science fiction and it's painfully real made a couple of tears went down of my cheeck.This is cinema guys, a masterpiece. You, without any doubt, will be shaken. Awesome score, the way that the director played with sounds throughout the movie was a step up, amazing performances, great message and as I said, you will be shaken.How far human race have gone and how simply that it is to vanquish us out of existence is quite a conundrum, when movies do this, it's when art truly shines."
"Fantastic performances. Cillian deserves an Oscar. Great cinematography and score. Stellar casting. Gorgeous effects. Very effective portrayal of the frenetic pace of the Manhattan Project and the existential dread that comes along with the invention of these terrible weapons.There are several flaws that are often present in Nolan's films. Swelling score drowning out important dialogue. Artificially fast-paced and complex dialogue filled with smug jargon. Unnecessarily complicated plots. The latter two are especially, unforgivably egregious in Oppenheimer without Nolan's well-shot action scenes to distract from them.There is no reason to be jumping between different timelines, there is no reason for so many characters, and there is no reason for Strauss' plot to be actually portrayed on screen rather than just alluded to. This is an 8/10 film dragged down to a 6/10 because Nolan thinks he's too clever for us mere mortals and is determined to shove a miniseries' worth of content into a theatrical film. I never say this about Nolan films but there really is no reason to see Oppenheimer in IMAX. It's 95% people talking to each other.I have long suspected that Nolan would be better served by making big-budget miniseries and Oppenheimer confirms that."
"One thing I don't like about this movie, there is a scene in this movie when oppenheimer was doing sex with his gf and using Hindu scripture Geeta phrase. If Christopher Nolan known for reality instead of VFX why doesn't he used real video reference and create separate scene for that movie. Before releasing, there was a hype about this movie because of Oppenheimer use the Geeta phrase after dropping the bomb by US army that was a reason, I was curious about to watch this movie but if you are not aware about physics & history, my suggestion for you do some RND first then you can watch this movie otherwise you will going to sleep on the chair. I think director doesn't explain movie so well."
"Three hours doesn't feel that long when you watch a great movie with solid plot and great acting overall. Having 3 oscar winner as cameos makes it feel more amazing. However i think the nude scene isn't really necesarry nor adding something crusial to the plot.Half of this movie is something related with quantum physic and the rest all about law and politic. However if you aren't into those things, you can still understand and enjoy the movies.All actors are charming and convinced as they potrayed the role, but emily blunt perfomance is the one that attract me the most. I hope she can win oscar next year."
"There came a point about midway into this film where my lungs began to hurt really bad. And then, not long after, I felt my whole body lurch and gasp for air. Turns out, I had quit breathing. That was how tense and on edge I was. Oppenheimer is a lot of movie to take in. At times, moments feel unnecessarily long and slow, but I believe that those things truly pale in comparison to the things this film does so well. For one, the casting choices are sensational. Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer will be remembered as one of the greatest casting choices in cinema. And of course, the rest of the cast reads like a who's who of Hollywood elite, and they provide incredible performances of their own. Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Jack Quaid, Josh Peck, Gary Oldham, and more. It's exceedingly rare having this level of talent in one movie. The sound design and cinematography of this movie is also Oscar worthy in every sense. The ticking of Geiger counters, Murphy's awed breathing as he watches the rolling flames in the aftermath of the atomic bomb's detonation, the camera flashes, it all pairs so well together. Oppenheimer is a film that must be experienced as much with the ears as much as the eyes. And, of course, the thing that Oppenheimer does best is how it supplants the audience in the shoes of its titular character. There are several moments throughout this film where it's hard to distinguish the feelings of the man on screen and the audience watching him. The weight of decisions he makes is felt on and off the screen. You can feel the burden that's on his shoulders as the implications of his achievements become clear. Oppenheimer is one of the most complicated men in all of history and Christopher Nolan has managed to tell his story for a new audience in a way that is sympathetic, honest, and prophetic. It is not a happy movie by any means, nor should it be. The life and times of J. Robert Oppenheimer is one of tragedy, not just personally, but for the legacy he is now fixed to. Through him, man has harnessed the power to create destruction on a mass scale. The man himself is gone, but his legacy remains to bear witness to both the limitless possibilities of science, and its consequences. This is an important film, and it needs to be viewed as often. A masterpiece in every sense."
"I've waited for this movie from the day it was announced mostly because Nolan was directing it. Although I'm a big sucker for documentaries and biopics and this movie really stands out and is really one of the greatest. While I was expecting it to be a little bit over the top with the blasts and bombings because of what it is based on and Nolan kind of has an expertise in it duh. But it justifies its name and makes sure it revolves around the Man who created it all in the first place and about his internal battles and psyche and it does that beautifully, by revolving in different timelines but still managing the constant tension in the movie is so great. The cast was out of this world and tells us that how great acting and good writing can make a movie a zillion times better than a CGI-based mindless action piece of junk."
"I have no critics for this film, but I have a good idea. After Oppenheimer, please make after-oppenheimer sequel film with the story of every country involved in world war 2. For example, Japan 1, Indonesia 1, United Kingdom 1. Later, the story of all countries would be met in Oppenheimer 2. Oppenheimer 2 is a film with a story of what if World War 3 happens, where every country that joined the war is fought using nuclear weapons.This is a briliant filmmaking. Oppenheimer respectively guides audience to the story by some visual clues but they have to get to grips with these quickly. This is the worth film to be given an Oscar."
"'Oppenheimer' is a near psychedelic collage of a film. It's edited in a dizzying fashion, and it manages to maintain its propulsion for its entire 3 hour run time. It's a biopic that utilizes the cinematic language of thrillers and action films, as well as grace notes that remind one of a more impressionistic indie movie story telling. It turns the historical character of Oppenheimer in to a morally complex sort of tragic super hero (similar to Nolan's Dark Knight films), who dons a fedora and a phallic pipe the way Batman does a cape and mask. It's pure Christopher Nolan and it may be the director's crowning achievement."

"Just home from viewing #Oppeneheimer at the Omniplex Tralee on a #MAXX screen. Overall I thought it is a fantastic movie. I was glued to my seat for the 3 hours. There was some stunning cinematography especially the Los Alamos site and he really captured the violence of the first explosion at the Trinity site.Cillian Murphy was brilliant as Robert Oppenheimer, but I thought that Robert Downey gave a tour de force performance as Lewis Strauss. I feel that I would have loved the movie even more if Christopher Nolan has explored more of the science behind the bombs. His treatment of the technology behind the bomb was weak and I feel he could have devoted more of the 3 hours of the movie to this aspect."
"It has taken me 24 hrs to calm down after watching the amazing film Oppenheimer. To put it bluntly it is quite simply mesmorising from start to finish and the hours just fly by.At the end of the film I have never seen an audience with shock on their faces at what they've just witnessed and people just sat in their seats for 5 minutes before saying anything.It took me and my son 20 minutes to speak to each other as we were taking in the film and everything that we'd just witnessed on the screen and we're still talking about it now it was that good.Cillian Murphy gives the performance of his life as Oppenheimer who was chosen to lead the Manhatten Project and then haunted by what he'd just achieved once the bomb had gone off.Robert Downey Jr has also given the performance of his career and if he doesn't scoop the Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars nextt year then it'll be a tragedy. The last 45 minutes of the film is the best i've ever seen him act.The supporting cast are just as good and really makes the film. Emily Blunt was great as his wife. Florence Pugh as his lover. Rami Malek as phyisacist Hill, Jason Clarke who's character interrogated Oppenheimer all worthy of a mention.The tension that built up to when the bomb first exploded is something i've never experienced before in a film. You really thought that it had failed and were williing it to succeed.The seeing Murphy playing the haunted Oppenheimer in the second half was just something else.Quite simply amazing and this is a film i'd advise everyone to watch in IMAX if you can but it will still blow you away."
I'm a decent lover of history and knew this would be a slog. It was. Enjoyable for me cos I was into it. But 3 hours of pure torture for anyone who isn't.Great performances from cillian and Robert but no. This is not a summer blockbusterUnable to recommend to a cinema goer.Nolan misses twice with as many films and his star is on the burnout. Gravity has taken over and it looks after tenet and this it's a black hole.Not an enjoyable experience sitting there for 3 hours and questioning why he chose to attempt this story. Wasn't a good time.Dunkirk and interstellar make me want to go to day one release of a nolan film.This and tenet. No.I won't rush back for his next. If you don't like history or courtroom dramas. Avoid.
"I was so looking forward to seeing this movie! Sadly, it failed on so many levels. I already had a fairly good knowledge of the various characters that were involved in the Manhattan project (i.e., Groves, Fermi, Teller, Bohr, Lawrence, etc.) but I pity anyone who saw this movie without understanding who the characters were in the big picture. I think that Nolan could have put a screen note with the name of the individuals on the screen at the moment, at least, at their first appearance. I was expecting a superficial yet intelligent overview of the science that was involved but the movie did nothing of the sort. The script writer was solely interested in the backroom drama concerning Opperheimer's security clearance. The producer was proudly making it known that no CGi was used in the making of this flick. Unfortunately, this is the one movie that could have benefitted from some serious CGI. I have seen amateur YouTube movies showing amazing home-made CGI nuclear explosions and these would have been much better than the lame gasoline fuelled explosion that was central to the subject matter. The depiction of the Trinity explosion was sorely lacking in size and intensity and it was devoid of the amazing colours and size of the original mushroom cloud. They could easily have used the actual historical footing of the Trinity test overlapped the various actors who were watching it.I saw this movie on iMax and frankly, the quality of the image was far below what I had seen in previous iMax productions. I am not kidding, the image resolution would have been better if it had been shot using my iPhone! The friend told me that he read that the iMax film was digitally scanned at 2k resolution; a far cry from 4K and yet, I paid the full iMax entry fee. Moreover, I am not sure what was happening on the set, but the cinematographer obviously had difficulty keeping the characters in focus. Let me finish by talking briefly about the sound. Each and every word spoken in this movie was played over an overbearing background music which, may I add, was overly dramatic and clearly just too loud!My friend and I both came out very disapointed. This movie should have been the highlight of the summer but it fell far short of the mark."
"Christopher Nolan movies have always been an acquired taste. I remember when Inception was released and there were mixed responses from the audience from ""Absolutely brilliant"" to ""What on Earth did I just watch?"" I love this about Nolan. His movies are designed to make us ask questions, to make us use our brains. We have become lazy in our viewing of entertainment. We want action packed explosions and everything handed on a plate and tied up in a little bow at the end. This is not that. Acting performances were superb from all parties. It is a theatrical, cinematic masterpiece. This movie is not about Oppenheimer being put on trial. This movie is about humanity being put on trial. It's a movie that needs to be watched more than once, like all Nolan movies, to truly be able to take in all of the amazing creativity, writing, music and acting. Is it essential to view in IMAX? Perhaps not. But, I really think this movie is something to be experienced, not to just be watched. That is what makes cinema special. Cinema isn't just watching a movie, it's experiencing a movie. Oppenheimer in an IMAX cinema was an experience that I am unlikely to forget."
Oppie is one of the most mysterious person in his real life and even with script his is the one who created the atomic bomb ...Nolan is going to win a Oscar for this film you'll all see that :)) he have a little bit music thing but i hope he will fix that in the future the cinematography is amazing as nolan always promised us he is trying even harder to get the more people to cinema in this hard circumstances around the world i hope nolan a the film will get an Oscar.The crew of the film the actors are amazing each one them did his job as well as he can specially Chillian murphy i hope he will also get an Oscar.

"Any creative who constantly improves upon their past works to deliver their absolute best possible every time deserves to be called a true artist, which Christopher Nolan is the pure embodiment of.Every stratagem used in his prior films has been perfected, elevating this artsy documentary to one of the deepest and most complex story Nolan has ever told, despite the straightforwardness of history.Oppenheimer might very well be the best character study ever put to screen.The film tells us everything about 'The Father of the Atomic Bomb' and yet keeps us in the dark regarding his thought process throughout. This feels brilliant because he was an emotionally immature man (as he says himself) and didn't always know why he did what he did.I also adored the distinction between the Fission(coloured) and Fusion(b/w) storylines, and the subtext of the former resulting in the latter, just like in the bomb.But the closing scene is where the film rises to a crescendo of its ingenious art and sound direction, thereby positioning it among the top five movie endings of all time.A myriad of further filmmaking and storytelling brilliance is dispersed all over but there aren't enough words in existence to do this movie justice.This film is all of Nolan and that is the best of Nolan."
"I would like to start by saying that this film is a 9.6. However, Nolan and this outstanding cast did an incredible job to universally allow all walks of life to understand the layers behind this invention; also, the life of the man behind it. The organization, detail, and emotions the film provides deepens the connection for the viewer to experience and become more immersed in this world. The overall pacing was incredible and constantly kept the viewer on edge for what would happen next. In conclusion, this film was a gift that shouldn't be taken for granted and thought about beyond face value."
"Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer deserves nothing less than a perfect rating!The excitement & anticipation were off the charts, and the movie did not disappoint.I am thoroughly impressed by this film! It has reached the cinematic masterpiece status with its impeccable pacing, outstanding acting, breathtaking visuals, and mesmerizing sound design. Every aspect of the movie was executed flawlessly!Nolan has outdone himself, delivering a stunning historical drama that delves into Oppenheimer's emotionally charged perspective. As we witness the transformation of his once passionate love for quantum mechanic into a heavy burden of profound moral and ethical dilemmas throughout the narrative.Upon leaving the theater, I found myself completely speechless, so deeply moved by the experience.Its 3-hour runtime felt surprisingly short, leaving me eager to watch it again. For a biopic, it remarkably maintains an intense and gripping atmosphere throughout."
"Everything was simply stunning in this movie, and it could be because I watched it in the intended IMAX 70mm format. I was completely engrossed the entire 3 hour run time, which is not an easy accomplishment. In the end, I left the movie thinking about so many things that are much larger than myself.I can say that this movie is not for everybody though. Many complain about how bored they were, or how the final act was too slow for them. I think those people missed the full point of the movie, and how carefully crafted the story was. This is one of those movies where if you do not pay attention to all of the small details, you will miss the big picture. The story jumps quite frequently back and forth in time. At first it is confusing, but that's almost the point. You, the viewer, sit there and piece together the story like you are having to make a judgement on Oppenheimer. The way that all of the bits and pieces of the story come together beautifully in the end is what makes the 3 hour run time worth it.I cannot recommend this movie enough, and if you are one of those lucky enough to have an IMAX 70mm theater near you, you are doing yourself a disservice by not watching it. I had awful seats in the back left corner, and it didn't matter."
"This is a true masterpiece. You won't find many movies alike, which are so nuanced and perfectly produced. First, the acting of Cilian Murphy and the other wonderful cast ist over the top. I have rarely seen someone express so many facettes of emotions without using words. All actors convince with an unbelievable authenticity, so that this movie absorbs you into its world, feeling real and close. The story is intense, intriguing, uplifting and depressing with a special touch from Christopher Nolan, who enhances key scenes drastically by using his well-known tools.I will desperately search for a long time to feel this much in the theatres again."
"I feel a bit disappointed with this movie. It was underwhelming for me. I know it's a biopic, but when the maker says you should watch it on a big screen, I expect it to contain a bit more science, something worthy of a big screen. But what we get is a biopic with a lot of politics and courtroom drama. I guess walking into a Nolan movie always expecting a spectacle like Inception or Interstellar can be disappointing.The performances from the stellar cast are as expected phenomenal. The movie is good, well made but it does get boring at times. I expected more from the biopic of the father of the atom bomb."
"Well what I can only describe as a meandering pule of un-chronological dross and an aimless recreation of fake history with nothing much other than exaggerated caricatures of real people for the sake of making grey characters black and white. A cinema audience will notice every overdramatic often ear piercing rumbling sounds of a bomb interjecting conversations thayprovide a means of prevention for the audience falling asleep over uninspired dull and meaningless dialogue that holds itself literally without any poetic candor or quotable value. The laughable overacting from Matt Damon paints a one dimensional picture of your stereotypical army general, seemingly mature audiences will be enraptured by the somehow oscar worthy performance of Cilian Murphy woodenly staring into the camera for 3 hours without uttering a word. The characterless blasé, second rate to Zimmer score plays at events so eventless as a man getting out of his car or going to the toilet, drowning out unintelligible lines from actors who focused too much on sounding American as opposed to coherent. Blunts tragic and forgettable performance of a hateful wife could not overshadow the pathetically small explosion that despite having a multimillion dollar budget was smaller than the real thing.Nolan has descended yet again from a pretentiousness that can only be surpassed (or subdued) by his lewd turn towards f-bombs and s*x scenes to appeal to a lewder 21st century audience. Like a sheet of gold oppenheimer is Pretty to look at but one dimensional. If anything, this movie proves the need for old cinema to return again."
"Oppenheimer simply put is just a great movie in every aspect, be it the performance, cinematography and the background score is something we need to experience at IMAX theatre and anything less would be injustice to yourself. Watching the movie we feel gifted to experience the actors perform and gives us a stellar performance. Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Florence and Robert Downey Jr are a simply a treat to watch.For the last couple of years we had endure a painful series of movies by Disney and Marvel under James Gunn(with an exception to the movie 'Joker') and now finally we get to see a movie that balances out the time we wasted on these movies.Thank you Mr. Christopher Nolan for allowing us to experience your movie."
"As a spectator you need to stay focused as the story jumps back and forth in time in dense and packed dialogues.From a cinematic perspective this is a fantastic movie. The sound effects of the trinity test, the tension build in the storyline, the acting performances are all great.The storyline stays close to the actual events and that makes it also very predicable and -dare I say it- a bit boring. There is hardly an element of surprise although Nolan tries to do this with a discussion between Einstein and Oppenheimer in the beginning. I consider it is more a well filmed documentary where some things are dramatized.Nevertheless, still worth to see in the cinema."
"With the recent releases of 'Oppenheimer' and 'Barbie', a new cultural phenomenon seems to have taken place that will help define the mainstream cinema of this decade. It is interesting to note how both films enhanced the other to solidify themselves as modern classics, if not for their craftmanship alone, then because of the hype that surrounded them. Christopher Nolan's latest, especially, is a testament to his greatness as a filmmaker. His previous movies, while always entertaining, have a tendency of pretentiousness, of wanting to be something they aren't really. 'Oppenheimer' works so well because the story is grounded in history, and Nolan uses this snapshot of time to get to the bigger ideas he always intended to show, making this the best film yet, of his already illustrious career.As usual for Nolan, time plays an important role in 'Oppenheimer'. The film itself can be reduced to three parts, each lasting an hour, in which the character is introduced to the audience, in which we see him build the invention he became known for, and how he needs to come to terms with the consequences of his creation. All this is being told through Nolan's signature style of structural experimentation. The life of Oppenheimer, and his accomplishments, is being contrasted with the senate hearing of the film's secondary antagonist, Lewis Strauss, and the interrogation of Oppenheimer's loyalty to the United States of America. Despite being incredibly dense and full of information, the three-hour running time goes by surprisingly quickly. This can be attributed to the way in which Nolan manages the time, never telling us more than we should know at that particular moment in the film, and thus keeping the suspense throughout.Another key mention in achieving this accomplishment is reserved for editor Jennifer Lame. Because there is so much of the story to tell, and much of the film is men talking in rooms, it is quite the task to make all of it engaging for the audience. She manages to do just that, with very quick and hard cuts, giving the feel of an action movie, which is needed for the film to succeed. Especially in the first hour, where the speed of the shots and the rhythm behind them, help visualize Oppenheimer's immense gifts. How he saw visions of the underlying reality that physics tries to expose. How he learned to look at the world differently, communicated to us through the art of Pablo Picasso.Despite it being a biopic, the film doesn't think too highly of its protagonist, even though it states his world-altering importance. The character Oppenheimer is used as a portal for showing how ambition and arrogance can corrupt even the greatest of minds. Oppenheimer would have been a weak man, were it not for his incredible intellect. A man capable of moral thought, but not guided by it. Only through reflection on his decisions does he arrive at any form of morality, but always does so too late. Unable to commit to anything truthfully, driven only by his ego and his impulses. Lusting after women he cannot have and failing to take a firm stance on his politics, in spite of his clear sympathies for communist ideologies. Someone of obvious substance, but no conviction, making him both particle and wave. When our main character is introduced to Niels Bohr in the beginning of the film, Bohr asks what the J in J. Robert Oppenheimer stands for, ""nothing, apparently'' his tutor quips. A cheeky way of translating the spine-lessness of the man we would follow around for three full hours. This is the story of someone incapable to decide on his direction, and unable to face the consequences of his actions, despite his evident genius. Theory, really does, only get you so far.But then again, what would happen if you stole fire from the Gods and gifted them to mankind? If you became Prometheus, but also opened Pandora's box? If you were Adam and Eve and the snake that made them sin in the Garden of Eden? Would such a burden not be too heavy to bear for us mere mortals? Would your act, and the effects that follow it, not appear larger than anything you could ever be? His creation of divine power would end up breaking him, but his arrogance and curiosity would not allow him otherwise. A victim of his own potential, with the only chance of redemption being martyrdom. A mythmaking that is eventually granted to him by Lewis Strauss, someone who shares a lot of similarities with Oppenheimer himself, and someone who would commit the same mistakes he did. Two entitled men, desperate to write history for themselves, only to get humbled by the very thing they helped create, all because they could not keep their pride and ambitions under control."
"Surely this movie is not for everyone. You have to connect with each and every character to understand and enjoy the full movie. All the actors has done their job quite passionately and last but not the least the movie will be remembered for its Screenplay, Acting, Direction, editing and Sound effects.. There are certain times in the movie there will be complete blank and you will only hear the person's breath.. There are multiple high profile actors in the movie and only Nolan can justify all the actors in a single movie.. People who thinks it's an action or thriller movie, will be disappointed..In one word it's an extravagant...!!!"
"This is why I love Christopher Nolan. He can take a character, event, and story and make an incredible film so rich with detail, great cinematography, and incredible acting that make you feel like you're part of the actual story. Watching Oppenheimer made me feel like I understood quantum mechanics, something I obviously do not. Watching Oppenheimer go from promising physics student to ""Father of the Atomic Bomb"" is probably one of the best cinema journeys I have ever been on. Cillian Murphy truly puts on a career best performance. Just through his facial expressions you can tell the conflict, anguish, excitement, and fear about creating what could potentially end the world as they know it.Murphy's co-stars put on a similarly stellar performance, which is incredible considering how scattered their scenes are, and how many of them there are. Emily Blunt, in my opinion, played an incredible Kitty Oppenheimer. It can't be easy being married to a husband creating the most powerful weapon ever made, plus raising two kids and going through the uncomfortable security hearing. However, Blunt plays the fiercely loyal and slightly troubled wife superbly. The team at Los Alamos is stellar as well, with Benny Safdie, Josh Hartnett, David Dastmalchian, Matt Damon, and even Rami Malek putting on great roles that really complement the tense political and scientific events of the times.This review could not end without talking about RDJ. Having seen him as Iron-Man for the past decade, it was incredible to see him play the intricate and complex character of Lewis Strauss. RDJ is a pivotal character to the story, second in importance only to Murphy. I felt like RDJ played the egotistical and cunning Strauss perfectly, and it's not until the near end when we see that he had been plotting Oppenheimer's demise early on, and how far his personal disdain for Oppenheimer affected his life. I think RDJ outside the Marvel universe will do just fine. Oscar performance for sure."
"While there was barely dialogue and mostly action in ""Dunkirk"", Nolan took almost the opposite approach for ""Oppenheimer"". The (for Nolan) unusual amount of dialog scenes are handled surprisingly well and allows most of the cast to really shine. Cillian Murphy gives, in my opinion, the best performance in a Nolan movie since Heath Ledger. Benny Safdie surprised me his fantastic portrait and Robert Downey Jr. Really proved his chops as a charismatic actor who can also go deep.I personally felt most involved with the moral questions the story and the building of the bomb. The movie seemed to hit a climactic peak after the testing of the bomb and its use in Japan. I expected the film to end soon after but at least 30 more minutes were spend showing court room discussions about Oppenheimers conflict with Lewis Strauss, which I felt could have been wrapped up sooner. Especially when Nolan used the same effect twice and showed Oppenheimer imagining the catastrophic consequences of the impact of his bomb for the second time, I felt like the movie had lost some of its momentum and tried to build it up again for the fantastic ending, that could have happened sooner.The court room stretch at the end is the only negative that comes to mind. Cutting between court scenes for 30 minutes and underscoring it with a soundtrack that seemed to copy some of Zimmer's Inception Themes felt like lesser filmmaking that I'm used to from Nolan. I've seen more exciting scenes in most court room dramas.In general Oppenheimer is one of Nolans most mature films that tells an unbelievably important story extremely well. Its the first time I walked out of a Nolan movie thinking less about his style and craft but more about the performances and story, which in this case, is a compliment."
"""I'm not really a movie reviewer or know exactly what to say, but I'll give it a go. First off, I thought the movie was amazing. Cillian Murphy was incredible; he really embodied the character of J. Robert Oppenheimer and sucked you right into the movie. It was amazing to see it in IMAX; you could truly feel the emotions of the characters. The music was insanely beautiful and intense, evoking feelings of fear, anxiety, and sadness. I thought it was brilliant.I felt really emotional watching the movie, especially considering the times we are in now. Oppenheimer and other physicists definitely created a new world that changed history forever. Robert Oppenheimer was an incredible physicist, and his leadership and contributions to the development of the atomic bomb had a profound impact on warfare and geopolitics.Cillian portrayed Oppenheimer's internal conflicts after the success of the project so well; it was incredible to watch. His performance felt raw and real, evoking sadness for Robert as I'm sure it wasn't easy for him, particularly after President Truman dropped those bombs on Japan. Moreover, the way Robert was treated by the United States government was quite sad and despicable, in my opinion. It's disheartening how a country could turn its back on a man who dedicated many years of his life to the Manhattan Project, which was initially meant for good, although I believe he later regretted it. I hope he found some peace in knowing that if it wasn't him, it would have eventually been someone else to create the first atomic bomb.In conclusion, Cillian Murphy's ability to convey emotions with a mere glance or a slight change in expression sets him apart as an actor of remarkable skill and control. His dedication and commitment to delivering exceptional performances that leave a lasting impact are evident in this role as J. Robert Oppenheimer. I hope he wins many awards for his exceptional and stunning performance.Emily was incredible in this movie; she gave an outstanding performance. Blunt's on-screen presence is captivating, drawing you into the character's life and emotions effortlessly. Her portrayal of Katherine Oppenheimer, the wife of Robert, was versatile and emotionally charged. Moving to the middle of nowhere with a child and dealing with Robert's affair throughout their marriage couldn't have been easy for her. Emily's performance built up brilliantly; it felt real, raw, and emotional.I did feel for Katherine, and I could truly sense the emotions in the movie. Emily's ability to communicate emotions without relying on dialogue was remarkable, making the character and the film all the more impactful. Her commitment to her roles and her willingness to take on challenging and diverse projects have solidified her position as one of the best actors of our time. I hope she wins many awards for her role in this movie.I also want to shout out Robert Downey Jr; he was incredible in this movie. What an amazing actor and human being. I hope he wins some awards for his role as well. While I won't deep dive into every character in the movie, I must mention Florence Pugh, who also gave an outstanding performance. Her willingness to be vulnerable and real was astonishing, displaying her ability to convey a wide range of emotions and navigate complex narratives. She is truly an amazing actor who deserves many awards and recognition.So, would I rate this movie? Absolutely! You must go see it in the cinema; it's just incredible. It's the best movie I've seen in a long time. I give it a 10/10."""
"This movie is one of a kind! Brilliant cast members, not a single bad acting performance from any. Cillian Murphy does an exceptional job at playing Robert J Oppenheimer, his dedication to the role is visible through his excellent delivery of this iconic performance. I love Nolans direction of a film, he knows how to capture tense moments well, his way of making the audience feel on edge is outstanding! Robert Downey Jr's performance was impressive too, I am happy we get to see him in a film like this! His performance was Oscar worthy by far alongside Cillian. Both incredible!!I watched this film in IMAX and it was amazing. I highly recommend people try to see it this way, It makes the whole experience feel a lot more real."
"OH man, I know I'm going to get thumbs down but I kept checking my watch after the 2 hour, this film really was an auditory assault of tediousness, I think this is an example of a movie that is soooo overhyped, while it was a very good movie, acting great, visuals spectacular, I definitely recommend reading up on who's who, as Nolan goes right into it without giving much of an explanation I think probably about 30 minutes could have been trimmed and it would be fine, also I was lost as these characters breeze right through the dialogue with a LOUD soundtrack playing over them a la Aaron Sorkin (first scene of Social Network) Lastly, also be aware that the black and white scenes are the future while the color scenes are the past."
"I love Christopher Nolan, but this was honestly a disappointment. Movie mostly revolved around Oppenheimer being ""trialed"" for his political involvement in communism... Hardly takes you through the scientific development of the atomic bomb and the exciting birth of quantum physics. Just mostly a movie about the politics revolving around the atomic bomb. And even that wasn't well done... The movie hardly portrayed anything about the horrific invention of the atom bomb. Just a few scenes of ""Oppie"" having a panic attack and some scientist mentioning it will kill lots of people. The movie doesn't even show the aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the consequences that follow... Just a mention of how many people were killed and that the evil politicians to decide on the attack didn't care about anyone. At the end all the movie was trying to do was make you feel sorry for Oppenheimer... Not something that needed 3 hours of build up with scenes of back and forth Q/A and politics..."
Nolan has done it again!! Cillian Murphy rises to the occasion after being a supporting character in previous Nolan films. Massive cast with familiar faces throughout the film. Robert Downey Jr. Does an intimidating performance while having his known charm. The music in this film was a massive highlight even without composer Hans Zimmer. Christopher Nolan constantly shows he knows how to pull out the greatest performances from his actors and why they always want to work with him. Highly recommend this film even if you are not interested in biopics. This is something else. Must watch film in Theaters.
"This film is excellent all the way around. I always liked Nolan's work, but this one cemented me as viewing him as a great filmmaker period, and not just a great blockbuster filmmaker. The script is extremely sharp and the stand out performance is Cillian Murphy who really puts his heart into the role. It does not feel like 3 hours and even though I knew a lot of the story, it was still very engaging and enjoyable. This one honestly rivals Memento and The Dark Knight for me as Nolan's greatest achievement. I would say it's even better than the Batman trilogy because the script is so much sharper. Don't walk, run to see this one in theaters!"
"In the realm of scientific pioneers, there are few figures as captivating and influential as J. Robert Oppenheimer. Our journey into the life and accomplishments of this extraordinary physicist left us utterly inspired and awestruck. From his early academic pursuits to his pivotal role in the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer's trajectory was nothing short of astounding.The title ""father of the atomic bomb"" hardly encapsulates the full spectrum of Oppenheimer's contributions. It is true that his leadership in the Manhattan Project led to the creation of the world's first atomic bomb, forever changing the course of history and introducing humanity to the complexities of nuclear energy. But there was much more to this enigmatic scientist than the moniker suggests.Oppenheimer's intellectual prowess and passion for research were evident from a young age. As he delved into quantum mechanics and theoretical physics, his insights opened new avenues of understanding in the scientific community. His theoretical work on black holes and quantum tunneling still reverberates through modern physics and remains foundational to ongoing research in these fields.Beyond his scientific accomplishments, Oppenheimer was an exceptional leader and educator. His charisma and ability to foster collaboration brought together some of the brightest minds of his time, creating a powerhouse of scientific innovation. His influence extended beyond his immediate circle, leaving an indelible mark on the scientific community at large.However, it is crucial to acknowledge the complex and controversial aspects of Oppenheimer's life. His involvement in the development of nuclear weapons weighed heavily on him, and he grappled with the ethical implications of his work. This inner conflict ultimately led to his troubled relationship with the government and his temporary removal from positions of influence.Despite these challenges, Oppenheimer's legacy cannot be solely defined by the shadow cast over his later years. His passion for knowledge, his pursuit of truth, and his contributions to science and education make him an indispensable figure in the history of human progress.In conclusion, exploring the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer has been a captivating and thought-provoking journey. The depth of his brilliance, his undeniable impact on scientific advancements, and the complexities of his character make him a truly fascinating subject of study. ""Oppenheimer: Illuminating Brilliance and Impactful Contributions"" pays homage to a remarkable scientist whose life and work continue to shape the course of scientific inquiry and human understanding."
"The movie is impeccable. The explosion scene was so beautiful and terrifying so I couldn't even breathe. Cast's effort is just perfect, director's effort is glorious and great. Christopher Nolan is the best director of modern cinema, only few can be with him on the same stage. Cillian Murphy must have his Oscar for this, it was just perfect. The most thrilling and beautiful moment was in the end, when whole audience just started the applause. I will never forget this movie and this IMAX experience. I highly recommend EVERYONE to watch it in IMAX, drive somewhere, If you don't have IMAX in your town."
"Dear God, if you can see it in IMAX 70mm, do it. The ability of Nolan's team to recreate Trinity in a way that makes you feel the full force of its consequences in one beautiful and terrifying sequence is masterful.I could say so much more, but honestly it doesn't need much prefacing. Nolan does a pretty solid job of not glorifying or vilifying Oppenheimer and presents the story with as much context as he can.While diversity is never Nolan's strong suit, it makes sense in the context of a historical film where the story has to focus largely on *mostly white men constructing the gadget.Murphy is excellent, but Downey's somewhat limited screen time is a tour de force and Oscar worthy as well."
"What can i say that has not been already said about this movie.It's just fantastic, Cillian Murphy just kills it in every possible way. The rest of the cast was also fantastic especially Robert downey Jr and Emily Blunt.Visually it's stunning as usual since we are talking about the brilliantly of Christopher Nolan. The practical effects, the twisting storytelling with a pretty much straight storyline is another reason that makes this movie amazing.Keep in mind, this movie has a slow story full of character development and long dialogues which can be ""boring"" to some people.So if you did not like breaking bad for example and thought that it was ""boring"", most probably you will feel the same thing here. If not this would probably be one of your favorite movies (like me)
Without getting into any spoilers, that was a rich experience that you will not experience it in many movies.10/10."
"At least three different timelines, intricately interwoven. Black-and-white and color sequences, numerous flashbacks, rapid transitions between the scenes. A complicated, probably even impossible task for the most regisseurs and script writers. Not for Christopher Nolan. He does it on everyday basis. He did it even more stunningly. One can think of Tenet, Prestige, Memento...
Firstly, it is a drama at its finest. Scientists are not too different from other people, after all, and often have the very same problems in their professional and family life. By no means are they always asexual bookworms. And even being the best physicists in the world, they can be extremely naïve. Several decades ago, they could be easily lured into thinking that some super-powerful weapon could end all wars on our planet forever. But they were definitely not the only ones who thought so. They are just as flawed as everybody, and they also pay dearly for their mistakes.Secondly, it is a historical film with the meticulously reproduced atmosphere of previous epochs. You can feel the heat of a scorched desert, appreciate the vintage clothing and experience that shuddering, all-consuming paranoia of the hunt for communist spies which ruined so many lives.It is even a superb detective film. If one hasn't read the story of Oppenheimer before watching the film, one can spend some time guessing whether it was Oppenheimer or someone close to him who leaked secret information to Soviets. The tension builds up gradually, but unrelentingly.Finally, it excels as a film about science and scientists. It shows the fascinating beauty of science, despite exploring deeply also its destructive side. There is an exquisite scene, where only a pair of phrases and scientific termini are enough for Oppenheimer to reach a conclusion that the Nazis are losing.It probably would be banal to praise the actors' performance. Who could not predict that Cillian Murphy would be unrivalled in this role? But it is worth mentioning that Matt Damon doesn't look bleak and irritating in Oppenheimer, in contrast to many of his previous films - and it is quite an achievement.Objectively, Oppenheimer has all characteristics necessary to be worthy of many Oscars. Subjectively, it probably would not win them. Will it at least be nominated? Nolan does not comply with current trends. And it is good that way. The trends can change every day - Nolan will remain. Since The Theory of Everything about Stephen Hawking, there was no such a film. It is enough to say that Nolan manages to awaken empathy for Japanese without even showing any Japanese victims of the nuclear bomb. Who could do more?"
"Hats off to Christopher Nolan. Murphy is living in thé character . No one can replace Murphy , really awesome. Nolan Murphy combination is extraordinary .Each and every scenes shows the professional movie shots. And some science theories is hard to understand in this movie especially the normal guys like me, except its all beautifully made. Its really good experience in IMAX digital. Not fully shot on IMAX but worth watching in IMAX. And for Indians I think its censored about 5-10mins. Must watch movie if you are a movie lover and experience it in IMAX for its fully immersive visual and sound experience."
"Go see this in an IMAX they said. It's the only way to see they said. Then I go to the regular theater and at the two and a half hour mark I start to wonder what would the IMAX experience have provided? This movie is straight drama. Interesting story. Great acting. Good cinematography. But 3 hour snooze fest I'd much rather have seen in my pajamas on my recliner at home.Then, the only reason it's rated R is for some random unnecessary sex scene for some actress that apparently really wanted the world to see her breasts.I suppose if the trailers showed what this movie was really about it wouldn't have done as well.Whatever. Nolan is on notice at this point. Stick to what made him stand out. This was a long drawn out drama."
"I want to give you a warning that this review contains spoilers; but I can't because there is nothing to spoil in this movie. Look at Oppenheimer's Wikipedia entry, and yes, as you guessed that's the scenario of the movie.Yes, I know, this is a documentary, but still the director Nolan could have added at least some action to the movie, such as showing how the British guy who sold files, got caught etc.Instead, they made a movie which is purely a documentary that seems to be made just to show appreciation for Oppenheimer.The movie features famous actors in even very small roles, which seems unnecessary, I guess that was the only way to make it a little interesting.Although the pictures / scenes are great, the movie is too long at three hours(!) and could have been condensed into a 90-minute documentary. Even Bollywood stopped making 180mins movies...We all love Nolan but this project would have been better as a five-episode series on HBO."
"The film begins with a quote about Prometheus, the figure from Greek mythology who stole fire from the gods to give it to mankind. This analogy is used in the book ""American Prometheus"" by Martin Jay Sherwin to refer to Jay Robert Oppenheimer, considered the father of the atomic bomb. The book investigates and narrates the creation of the Manhattan Project, which led to the development of the atomic bomb.Nolan, intrigued for quite some time by subjects such as astronomy, physics, nuclear energy, and war, found in Oppenheimer's life the perfect moment to narrate how this man gave humanity the capacity for self-destruction.The plot takes us to the time of World War II, where new scientific discoveries, particularly Albert Einstein's findings on quantum physics, led to the creation of the atomic bomb under Oppenheimer's leadership. The movie delves into Oppenheimer's life, from his transformation from an ordinary man to the creator of the bomb, to how he dealt with the consequences of his actions. Kilian Murphy, in a standout role, convincingly and humanely personifies the different moments of Oppenheimer's life.The film showcases how Oppenheimer had the support of other scientists in his project, giving science a prominent role in the narrative. Unlike Nolan's previous films, ""Oppenheimer"" focuses more on dialogue and music rather than grandiose settings and action sequences.The plot explains the creation of the atomic bomb but also delves into the reasons behind its development and the motivations of its creators. The movie avoids focusing on destruction and battle; instead, it concentrates on the characters' emotions and how they face the consequences of their actions.Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. And Emily Blunt deserve at least an Oscar nomination for their performances in the film,The Soundtrack also was gorgeous, Ludwig Göransson really understood the assignment, doing one of the best scores in his career. I think this one complements the film on the best way possible.Nolan displays his cinematographic prowess in the narrative, immersing the audience in an engaging experience. The use of CGI and visual effects is done elegantly, creating surreal and spiritual moments. Throughout the film, it becomes evident how Nolan has evolved as a director, prioritizing artistic freedom over commercial expectations."
"The movie is a masterpiece psychological study in personal and power relations.So, this could easily have been a Paul Thomas Anderson movie.It can be considered some sort of a ""Citizen Kane"" coming from Christopher Nolan.We see some stellar acting performances.Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Are certainly Oscar bound.Even Matt Damon finds his niche in the all-American, Boston-MIT produced general.However, I want to emphasize Gary Oldman as Harry Truman.Gary Oldman gives a two minutes master lecture in method acting.I guess it would help if you some knowledge of the historical context."
"The movie begins (literally) with a bang, and ends the same. In between I watched with amazement as the first 70mm IMAX movie I've seen blowing me away with visuals and sounds and emotions I've never quite felt in a theater before. This movie is an experience unlike all others I've seen in my life.I'm not a critic. I'm not here to break down the themes of science or morality. I'm here to tell you to watch this movie on the biggest, best screen you can and let yourself be absorbed by it.The one thing I can assure you is you need to see this at the theater. There is no way this is going to have the same visual effect at home. Do yourself a favor see it now."
"It is a masterwork of cinematic art. All of the performers did a fantastic job especially Cillian Murphy who stood out because he felt like real-life Oppenheimer. The movie's technical aspects were flawless.However, I didn't find the movie to be as engaging as I had hoped because of its genre. Action, thriller and suspense movies are often my favourites. Therefore, I wasn't thoroughly entertained. Usually in Nolan movies you get truly invested in plot, however, I didn't find the case with this one.In conclusion, movie is cinematic masterpiece. However, I'm afraid to say that you won't love it as much if you have entertainment expectations similar to those of Inception, Interstellar, and Dark Knight. Recommended, but it is a one time watch."
I saw this in IMAX. Though most of the film consists of people talking and talking and talking...it is never dull and it held my attention for the entire 3 hours. The film is also LOUD. The soundtrack is overpowering and extremely emotionally manipulative. It's as if the composer was asked to illustrate in sound how the audience should feel at every single moment. It made me think of opera...specifically Richard Wagner's theory of the Gesammtkunstwerk where all of the arts work together to provide a super sensory experience beyond any reality. The sound (or music) is meant to communicate with your subconscious as opposed to your conscious mind. But I sometimes became all too conscious of the soundtrack and found it distracting. That's why I rate this film at an eight. Nevertheless this is a must-see film and I thank the filmmakers for giving us something very worth watching.
"One of the most honestly and brilliantly made film with great performances, technical excellence & more importantly a conscious 'Love for Humanity'.Nolan has shown an unbelievable craft in filmmaking.As a teacher of Screenplay, I advice all film students and young filmmakers of India, first to go through the Notes & Reviews by critics and if possible to read whatever available on the life of Oppenheimer and then go and watch it on the biggest screen available to them.Cillian Murphy just took the 'Avatar' of Oppenheimer and so also every performer. The haunting dialogue in the film, to me, is President Truman's words ' Don't ever get that cry baby here'. A frightening one and you will see what it has done to Oppenheimer. And not to miss the conversation between Einstein & Oppenheimer. It will open your eyes and blow your minds.KL PRASAD."
"I have been a Nolan fan since 2008 when my friends introduced me to the dark knight. Since inception, I have made it a point to watch all his films in theatre in the first week itself.Oppenheimer already had such rave reviews. The hype is worth it. Nolan lifts a heavy subject and handles it skillfully without ever losing sight of the gravity of atomic weapons for the mankind's survival.Cilian Murphy is brilliant as always. The story involves so many celebrated scientists from previous century. Niels Bohr, Einstein, Heisenberg, Feynman, Fermi are the big names any average student of science or physics would come across in basic curriculum. I didn't know all of them were so intimately involved in this endeavour.The interactions between Einstein and Oppie were my favourite moments from the film. One man revealed this huge secret to the mankind and the other man made its application possible.Nolan devotes lot of time on the consequences and hearings where Oppenheimer's life is dissected brutally. At times, this may seem a bit stretched, but maybe it is necessary to drive home the point.Overall, July was the month when Tom cruise and Christopher Nolan once again proved why there is no alternative to actual cinematic experience at least for some special movies."
"I may consider myself lucky to be alive to watch
Christopher Nolan Works which get better by years.Oppenheimer is - with no doubt- going to be one of the best movies in the history. Amazing cinematography,
Exceptional acting and terrifying Soundtracks.All the cast are great from cilian Murphy who is going for the oscar with this role to Rupert Downey jr and Emily blunt and finally rami malik who has small scenes but you will never forget them.I didn't watch it in Imax as i couldn't wait and ran to the nearest cinema but now i will sure book an imax ticket.Don't waste any time, BOOK YOUR TICKET IT RIGHT NOW."
"I have been a lover of Nolan's movies since my childhood and have developed feelings that ""whatever topic that he touches, converts into a gold"". He has proven that, be it Dunkirk, Batman Trio or even Tenet. But this time, he has done a weak job.Now, don't get me wrong, I have seen many documentries and I understand that this movie is not for everyone, it needs ""patience"" to watch. I have been with many movies which includes only onversations and are well made... but this... doesn't give the feelings which one would need to ""feel"" the Oppenhiemer's character. It could have been made much better.Firstly, we expect in any biographical movie, it would give some background to the character. Here, it doesn't even start from his childhood (even though it is a long 3 hour movie). There are many events that could be told about Robert J. Oppenhiemer. How he got interested in Physics, how his friends bullied him when, how he suffered emotionally when achieved success and many parts of his life would have given a great depth of his character, but back to back to back to back close up shots and him thinking makes not sense most of the time.The movie mostly is around Oppenhiemer's interrogation with his involvement in the Manhattan project. Many characters have been selected brilliantly, especially Einsten's and Oppnhiemer's himself are well casted.The way to movie was marketed, the way there was a hype ""a perfect cinematic experience"", ""a perfect IMAX movie"" were totally non-sense. This movie can simply be seen in any typical movie theatre. There is the conversation! Except one or two blast sequences, you wouldn't miss a thing that may make you wish that could be seen in IMAX.If Robert was deeply enchanted by Bhagvad Gita, then it could be some ""serious"" scene where he is reading Bhagvad Gita and it is deeply impacting him in his hard times or whatever, but instead have shown during a cheap s*x scene! This is not the Nolan whom I knew!See ""Rocketry the nambi effect"" or even ""Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran"", I would say ""they are worth watching in IMAX!"".Anyways, the good things are: Acting. It is fabulous. Of each, single, character. The sound design, perfect. It is much much effective, in many scenes. The cinematography, oh my! Just lack in the storytelling and storyline.Seems like Nolan picked up a story, ""tried"" to add some tweaks like black and white and IMAX and expected it to be the Nolan level great, but this time it isn't, as far as what I felt.I tried to give my honest review, even though it is Nolan, it is not he best film of his career, it could have been much better. Hope, next time he would come up with his ""originals""!Seriously missing the 2010-15 times where we were getting his back to back masterpieces!"
Yes technically great filmmaking. But sooo boring. Why is the central conflict around the appointment of a potential secretary of commerce? Weren't there richer moral issues to mine in the creation of the bomb? Politicians. Courtrooms and conference rooms.Murphy was excellent. Robert Downey Jr a disappointment. Blunt did what she could with a small part. Damon lit it up and energized the screen in his small part. Pugh's character inessential to the plot but I guess that's how we got the nudity in?I was really looking forward to this as a Nolan fan and a history lover. What a slog. Do not recommend rushing out to see this. Wait for it to be free on Max.
"Nolen's newest movie comes with a great many strengths: amazing actors, intriguing storytelling, grandiose IMAX pictures, an ear-shattering soundtrack, and no obvious weaknesses. The storylines, the pilot drama in black and white, the historical creation of the bomb, the Security clearance Hearing and the flashbacks from Oppenheimer's life go hand in hand and support each other well. The movie does a great job of laying the complexity of the ethical debate around the creation of the bomb and the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, without taking sides. However don't be surprised if the movie leaves you without the pure area of an Inception, Interstellar, or TeneT. Less questions are left open and more depressing topics are explored. Overall definitely worth the money and time."
"No one can doubt Nolan for sure, this is the best movie in the past 5 and after all of his great career and fantastic movies he had it is so beautiful to see that Christopher Nolan still has passion for making movies.The sounds effects the bomb scene it will stay in my mind forever what an experience I lived at that scene, for the first time ever all people in the theater were in silent, people missed these kind of movies.The movie was 3 hours long, somehow you feel there are. Alot of unnecessary scenes and also there are a lot scene should be longer to explain to us more.At the end I truly recommend watching this movie to see the history of the most awful and important invention the human ever made."
"""Why do people go to the cinema? What takes them into a darkened room where, for two hours, they watch the play of shadows on a sheet? The search for entertainment? The need for a kind of drug? All over the world there are, indeed, entertainment firms and organisations which exploit cinema and television and spectacles of many other kinds. Our starting-point, however, should not be there, but in the essential principles of cinema, which have to do with the human need to master and know the world. I think that what a person normally goes to the cinema for is time: for time lost or spent or not yet had. He goes there for living experience; for cinema, like no art, widens, enhances, and concentrates a person's experience-and not only enhances it but makes it longer, significantly longer.""Andrei TarkovskyI came across this quote wright before entering the cinema to watch Oppenheimer and it sums up pretty much the essence of what I experienced watching this masterpiece, calling it a movie seems to not be enough.It's history, it's science, it;s engineering, it's art, it's psychology, it's a cinematographic matesterpiece, it's human, it's touching and it's terrifying."
"What can I say, this goes together with movies like Tree of life, Melancholia, Inception, Blade runner 2049. When the movie stays with you after you walked out from the theatre.Despite being very dialogue heavy, I was drawn to the screen almost for the whole time. Amazing cast, with great supporting actors. Amazing character play by Cillian Murphy.Also I think movie has a very strong idea, it is a man who brought the capability for humans to destroy themselves.We see the genius who gradually realises the impact of his work and that he is no longer can stop it. A chain reaction.Arguably best Nolan movie to date."
"This captivating movie boasts a compelling storyline, especially if you're familiar with the renowned figures connected to the field of physics. Its intriguing plot kept me engaged throughout, and I genuinely believe that any attempt to shorten it would have undermined its impact. What struck me the most was its profound relevance to the current concerns surrounding artificial intelligence and ChatGPT. The movie left me awestruck, pondering the potential consequences of advancing technology. It paints a vivid picture of a future where humanity might be like two scorpions in a cage if we let conflicts escalate. Thought-provoking and riveting, this film leaves an indelible mark, urging us to reflect on the path our world is taking."
"The first hour of the movie screams ""afraid of losing my audience"". At points it's almost like a trailer, with random lines thrown one after the other. It gets better from the bomb test onward, then the last half an hour is completely unnecessary, just like the entire character of Downey Jr, despite his great acting.The lead was truly inspiring acting, but had little to work with, and there's close to no character development, it's a 3 hour puddle that's afraid to go into any depth, very fast paced and compellingly directed. He's feeling sorry, then he's not feeling sorry, then he's feeling sorry again. Confusing af.The movie is made for people with ADHD and Tiktok addiction, jumping back and forth between 1000 timelines, that they had to make one black and white just to not lose the audience. Why make a drama if you're so afraid of it?The sound and music make me think Nolan has a hearing problem. It's so loud it's distracting. I guess he wants to reproduce the feeling of attending a concert, or cover all the possible people getting bored and talking during the movie. Who knows?The script has a lot of cheap Hollywood tropes sprinkled throughout. Definitely not a masterpiece, albeit an entertaining movie. You gain nothing by watching it. No substance. Might have watched a Nolan movie about drying paint and would have been just as good, and just as hollow.Conclusion: it's compelling and you won't get bored, but don't expect any substance or character depth."
"Nolan's MASTERPIECE To The World.I saw it today from the starting to the end it's amazing..it's mind blowing performance..The Casting is the perfect casting I ever seen.. Cillian Murphy & RDJ Was Amazing like more than ever. Every Character was played perfectly..
The Movie Is Real, Massive & Powerful.. Its not just a movie it's the history of mankind..It's a Must Watch Movie of the Century.. I'll See it Again..to find if there anything I missed.. Thanks To Christopher Nolan For Making Such A Masterpiece. He Deserves A Oscar for this also Cillian and RDJ.. I'm Pretty Sure they will..Once Again Guys Just Watch it On IMAX if possible if not Watch it in 4k with Dolby Atoms."
"Well, Nolan does it again! And in a different way than his previous work. While his other movies, like The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, and Tenet have a lot of action, this film strays away from that (in a good way). By the end, their were two important things that I took from this movie. #1) It was basically all dialogue and score. With that being said, it's also a picture perfect example on how a movie can be so enthralling with just those two things. #2) I'm predicting some Oscar nominations in the future, specifically from Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and RDJ. More specifically, the last 30 minutes belong to Cillian and Robert's acting! Hats off to them! While it does certainly feel like the entire 3 hours, it will instantly grab your attention and never backs down. I encourage every cinema lover to see this film on the biggest screen possible!!"
"This movie is undoubtedly the best movie I've ever watched, I can't describe to anyone the state of shock I am in by how good the movie was. This movie was not only an experience. But an artistic masterpiece, I felt immersed in the movie completely feeling every emotion all of the people in the movie felt. The acting was fenomenal. I really don't know how I'm going to be able to watch any other piece of cinema without comparing it to Oppenheimer. Lately movies haven't been doing it for me lately I feel like the directors are always trying to push something down our throats and feel cheaply made, this movie is different we are truly lucky to be alive during Cristopher Nolans reign. I think he will go down as the best director of all time if he keeps quality of movies up."
"Big Nolan fan here, but I was overall disappointed in the film, I think I had too higher expectations going into it. The film had some absolutely amazing moments in these short spans which I loved to bits...and then would revert to a slow movie where the pacing wasn't great. The film felt like it dragged a little to fill up the 3 hour runtime.That being said, the acting was phenomenal and use of special effects over visual effects was great to watch. The soundscape is just what to expect from a Nolan film, with a good soundtrack and great sound effects. I would recommend watching the film with a good sound system for the best experience. I really wanted to love this movie, but just was uninteresting in some area's of the movie."
"Boring, too long, confusing and too loud. I was looking forward to this but it's such a mess. How could you make a film about developing the first atom bomb and not only make it so boring but set the bomb off with an hour still to go.The story with its confusing and pointless non linear telling along with incredibly loud music where none was needed make it a complete mess.Acting is ok but nothing special and some characters seem to be there because people have heard of them, like Einstein but add nothing to the story.And I'm not being prurient when I say that Oppenheimer's mistress with her kit off was about the best thing in the whole film ."
I was glad I had listened to the two Rest is History podcasts about Oppenheimer in advance but still struggled to follow all the characters and timescales of the post war events.I found the love scenes unnecessarily using nudity - absolutely cringeworthy and maybe men will like that bit but embarrassing or what !! Also maybe men love those sexual positions but do women ! Fed up with this influencing poor younger girls watching that.It is definitely a period of history that we should know about and certainly it is still relevant sadly.I felt the Big Short did better at explaining a complicated idea.Certainly this film would have required a different style to do that but I think they could have thought of something.I found the sound quality a little tricky and missed a few words.I think I need subtitles!! I'm now used to that in my online viewing !
"I went to watch Oppenheimer with a lot of hope, mostly because Nolan was at its helm and Downey was in it.I was not disappointed at all; I must say, I did not expect at all that the movie would turn out this good. However, before I go further, I must point out that, for good or bad reasons, this movie is not for everyone. It demands utmost attention from its audience, since every single scene constitutes a crucial part of the story --- miss one scene and the story falls apart. Thus, even at a colossal runtime of 3 hr, the story feels amazingly tight-knit.The story is adapted from a very nice book on Oppenheimer called The American Prometheus, but Nolan does not shy away from giving the movie his own vision. His non-linear storytelling shows itself again, but it is used extremely effectively (though, I suspect, at a risk of confusion to some audience members). The story zigzags between three connected tales: Oppenheimer's story from his student-days at Patrick Blackett's lab in Cambridge to his involvement in the Manhattan Project, Los Alamos, culminating in the Trinity Test; his subsequent security hearing; and the hearing of Lewis Strauss (whose character is absolutely nailed by Downey Jr).The acting is... flawless, and that is an understatement. Particularly Murphy & Downey Jr. This is probably the best performance from RDJ in his career, and undoubtedly the career-best for Murphy yet. Other performances are noteworthy too: Florence Pugh, who plays Jean Tatlock, uses her relatively shorter screentime amazingly efficiently, and Matt Damon delivers a solid performance. Emily Blunt is at her best.I must mention the background score. It is a.m.a.z.i.n.g., down to the last chord --- Goeransson's dedication is pretty obvious. The cinematography is also exceedingly good, particularly after Tenet, with some shots that are likely to be etched into the viewer's memory for a long time.Overall, VERDICT: Please watch it! It will probably be the best movie you'll watch in this year... or maybe this decade."
"It was truly incredible! I strongly encourage you to go to the cinema to see it. It's a rare and unique experience, in line with Christopher Nolan's talent, that you won't forget anytime soon. It's clearly one of his best films, and in many aspects, his finest work. I found the editing work to be amazing, and I really hope it will be nominated for the Oscars for that. The casting is fabulous, the direction is grandiose, Cillian Murphy is superb, and the music and sound design are outstanding. All the images illustrating the quantum world are magnificently illustrated by a sound design that will give you chills. The Trinity sequence puts you in a crazy tension. I can't wait to see it again to fully grasp all its aspects, and the ending leaves you speechless."
"What can I say, its a piece of art no doubt about it. Picture, sound, colors, actors line up, all of it makes an excellent movie. But what you would find your yourself is that after the movie your brain is gonna go crazy. Crazy because the topic, the execution and sequence of how Nolan presented what was a real life event and the consequences of it that we inherited today is gonna make you think a lot. I can easily say that many movies can be excellent, but only few can be exceptional and Oppenheimer is one of them. Watch it on cinema IMAX, and please do leave some time to think about the last words of that movie, maybe after all art can change the world through each one of us."
"The cast of the movie is insane every single star deserve an award for his performance. Biographical more than pure drama but Murphy played it very well. I enjoyed it although it is very long. RDJ, Matt Demon and Emily Blunt were all amazing in their characters. I was expecting more ww2 scenes especially the bombing moments but it was not there.Overall the movie is excellent but was overhyped and marketed very well that made a lot of people think it was about the ww2 and involving more war scenes some was disappointed later and see the movie as boring long biography one. Thank you Mr. Nolan."
"It's been a while since a movie had such a profound impact on me as ""Oppenheimer."" If we categorize Nolan's films into easy-to-understand and complex ones, ""Oppenheimer"" falls into the latter category. However, its rich and layered narrative structure, thought-provoking dialogues, and intricate storytelling involving three segments of Oppenheimer's life make it a cinematic masterpiece.Every minute of the film is filled with meaningful details, and each performance and scene carries significant weight, culminating in an ending that leaves a lasting impression.After watching ""Oppenheimer,"" my mind couldn't stop pondering the ethical dilemmas arising from the intersection of technological advancement and moral responsibility, the complexities of human nature, and the struggle between scientific truths and political realities. As a devoted fan of Christopher Nolan's works, I firmly believe that ""Oppenheimer"" establishes him as the Kubrick of this century, skillfully weaving history and storytelling into an unforgettable cinematic experience.""However, its structural complexity, cutting the timeline into three segments with both forward and backward storytelling, numerous metaphors, subtle dialogues, physics terms, and many political and scientific figures, combined with the political background of World War II and the Cold War, might discourage some from delving deep. I noticed some audience dozing off midway, and heard complaints about the abundance of dialogue from some leaving the theater. As a devoted fan of director Nolan, I'd rank this film among his top three works, but it won't have universal appeal like ""Inception,"" ""Interstellar,"" or ""The Dark Knight."""
"In ""Oppenheimer,"" Christopher Nolan presents a remarkable cinematic achievement that explores the significant historical period of World War II and the development of the atomic bomb. With his exceptional vision and storytelling skills, Nolan takes the audience on an immersive journey, vividly portraying the complexities and ethical dilemmas faced by J. Robert Oppenheimer, expertly portrayed by the talented Cillian Murphy. The film's meticulous attention to historical accuracy and its stunning recreation of the era are truly awe-inspiring. Nolan's direction captivates viewers, creating a palpable sense of tension and urgency that keeps them on the edge of their seats throughout the movie. The utilization of practical effects and breathtaking visuals enhances the realism, effectively transporting the audience back in time. Cillian Murphy's performance as Oppenheimer is truly remarkable, as he skillfully captures the scientist's internal struggle between loyalty to his country and the moral implications of his work."
"I've only rated two moves as 10s: 12 Years a Slave (2013) and Nocturnal Animals (2016). I've rated many, many awesome movies as 9s, but this one surpasses my relatively meager 9 rating. Christopher Nolan's screenplay based on Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin's American Prometheus is outstanding and does the authors well-deserved justice! Casting is phenomenal. Cillian Murphy (Robert Oppenheimer) knocks it out of the park! Emily Blunt (Kitty Oppenheimer) strangles the audience with her relentless drinking! I recently reread American Prometheus in preparation for this movie since I first read it nearly two decades ago. I rediscovered all my underlines from back then that truly spoke to me. They still speak to me now! Because this story takes place across many years, I really appreciate how Nolan switches back and worth with shots in color and then in black/white to separate different times throughout the story. Everyone in this awesome cast plays very well! Cinematography is outstanding. Music is apt. I just knew that 3 hours wasn't going to be too long of a movie, and it was not! I trust Nolan with his storytelling. He can go however long he deems necessary."
"This is a good movie. With the typical non-linear narration of its director Nolan, and despite certain self-indulgence, also classic in its creator, the film never bores at any moment, although I believe it is a challenging watch and it's not for everyone.It's a bit disappointing in the scientific aspect. To tell the life of a scientist and the scientific and technological epic of the Manhattan Project without touching upon science is odd. The movie focuses on the humane and, above all, political aspects, completely leaving science aside, perhaps in line with the current times.The problem with such a superficial approach is that it fails to convey the magnitude of the events: watching the movie, one gets the impression that a group of scientists set up a holiday resort, spent four meetings scribbling on a chalkboard to solve the problem of fission, and the rest of the time, they partied, talk politics, be weird, and had children. The moment of the Trinity test doesn't show how that explosion must have been, it looks like quite small and it seems more like any action movie explosion with Dwayne Johnson badassesly walking in front of it.Once forgotten the epic of the scientific quest (and setting aside the fact that it portrays physicists as weird beings, and Physics is reduced to some kind of hallucination), the movie uses courtroom drama and political intrigue to build tension and emotion in a story that would have been rather lackluster otherwise - just the intimate view of its protagonist.Although the scientific part is superficial, the details are quite well taken care of, like the Fermi stack, the Gadget, Lawrence's cyclotron, all shown without explaining anything, which means nothing to viewers unfamiliar with the subject matter.Anyone who watches the movie without knowing anything about the history of the Manhattan Project will likely get lost in the rapid succession of events and characters. Many famous physicists pass fleetingly, remaining as secondary characters with barely any development, except for a few exceptions. Even Oppenheimer's wife, Kitty, appears overly simplified; the focus is on her role as a non-vocational mother, dealing with her alcohol addiction and suffering from Oppenheimer, overlooking her role as a biologist and her work analyzing blood to monitor the possible negative effects of radioactivity.Therefore, I would recommend either reading the book on which the movie is based (The American Prometheus) or consulting any of the many internet sources before watching the movie.For those with some knowledge, there are many easter eggs and references: Richard Feynman's bongos, Kurt Gödel's paranoia, the 100-ton test (which in the movie gives the impression of being kids playing with big firecrackers) and some more. The most curious one is that digital countdown clock, which is a Soviet model from the 70s-80s and didn't exist during that time; perhaps given the movie's attention to detail, it might be a strange paradoxical message, as if they wanted to include a Soviet timer for some reason.The movie also takes many liberties: the apple story was not as the movie tells it, or the involvement of physicist David Hill wasn't as depicted, for example.All the actors are incredible, though. Even Gary Oldman, who appears for 2 minutes playing Truman, but it's enough; he's impressive. All of them are fantastic. It smells to Oscar for Murphy and maybe others. Murphy and Emily Blunt deserves it for sure."
"This is a 3-hour long, drama-documentary about the scientist behind the US atomic bomb - emphasis on the drama. Except there is no drama, it's a courtroom flashback to a long succession of meetings, attended by actors on the up doing impressions of famous people from the past. Who were, on the whole, very unpleasant. Chain-smoking, philandering, swotty show-offs, some of them.Because there is no drama, Nolan has to introduce sex scenes; without them, 'Oppenheimer' would be like The West Wing set in 1943. Matt Damon and Cillian Murphy certainly deliver the thespian goods (no chain-smoking for Oppie or daily booze for Grovesy, mind), but there are only two sources of tension:1, Will the Nazis develop The Bomb first?2, Was Oppenheimer a Comyanist?Since everybody knows the answer to both those questions - well, No.1, even if you weren't paying attention - this film is more about 'how well is history dramatised?' Yes, the History Channel will be gnawing its heart out, but even they don't squeeze out 3 hour-shows.This. Movie. Has. No. Story. There are far better movies, and far better books. Nolan tries to cram everything, including quantum theory, in and the result is a long and tedious firework display. By the end, you're wishing you'd never been Born."
"The subject matter of this film is immense, intense, and powerful. With Christopher Nolan at the helm and Cillian Murphy anchoring the film, they more than met the emotion and gravitas needed to anchor the story. Every detail was accounted for: the practical effects, sets, and costumes grounded the film necessarily. The impact of the sound mixing, makeup, and score cannot be understated - this may be one of the great scores.The story was INCREDIBLY complex. Drawn from Dr. Oppenheimer's biography directly, it's clear there were likely some heated production meetings determining which details were precious and relevant enough to keep. While every element contributed to the overall portrait of the man, it was occasionally to the detriment of the editing. The beginning portion of the film was edited so tightly and quickly it felt like a trailer, and therefore many early elements (such as Florence Pugh's portrayal of Jean Tatlock) were not allowed room to breathe.The casting included giant after giant. Movie lovers will get a little thrill each time a new giant or up-and-comer appears in a supporting role. The only odd piece was Rami Malek - though his character ended up playing an important role, his distinctive looks and his particular charisma stuck out even amongst a heavy-hitting cast.Emily Blunt in particular proved she's far more than a pretty face as the fierce, volatile Kitty Oppenheimer. Others, like David Krumholtz and Josh Peck, are signaling a new direction in their career that could yield promising results.Overall it's a superb execution of a complicated portrait of a complicated man."
"My greatest teacher and inspirer Christopher Nolan has delivered another magnificent work of art that is both entertaining and terrifying.Oppenheimer is a movie that stays true to many of Nolan's cinematic techniques and traditions which I loved to experience again. An elaborately written nonlinear story, exciting montages throughout the entire film that give you goosebumps with incredible score by Ludwig Göransson, breathtaking cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema and the star-studded cast led by Cillian Murphy who delivered a phenomenal performance. You literally live inside his mind and emotions through the entire film.The film is, as Nolan concluded, as much devastating for the viewers watching it in the theater as it is horrifying. The contrast between scientific triumph and the guilt for the tragedy, the tension built with intense shepard tones serve the story perfectly.""I am become death. The destroyer of worlds"" . . ."
"I wasn't expecting too much - a movie about a physicist and a nuclear bomb? It seemed like one of those boring movies, an autobiography with boring sequences.Well... but this is a Nolan-movie! And although I have to admit that there were some movie-goers who left early (probably because they couldn't keep up with Nolan), I was hooked from beginning to end.In the middle of the movie it became so oppressive that I cried for about half an hour.Spoiler alert:I started crying when they nonchalantly discussed that they had preselected 12 cities in Japan to drop the bomb on. It was an ice cold decision that cost 200.000 people, most of them innocent, their lives. I was bawling my eyes out by the time that the other scientists cheered after realising that the bomb successfully detonated in Japan, while Oppenheimer imagined a charred body that he stepped into.I cried for all those people who died. And I heard others cry in the theater...The incredible mundane political drama is put in its place, when Strauss is told that he was probably too insignificant compared to what Oppenheimer and Einstein talked about to acknowledged by Einstein, though he took it as an insult.The revelation in the end of the film that Einstein was in deep thought after Oppenheimer pretty much told him that he set the world on fire, is even more chilling, because it makes a large part of the political drama in the movie pale in comparison to the monstrosity created by Oppenheimer and others.RIP Oppenheimer, I hope you've found your peace eventually!The cast is incredible. Who impressed me the most is probably Robert Downy Jr. Who played Lewis Strauss. Incredible performance and in my eyes deserves an Ocar for this!I don't know how Nolan does it again and again... but he does."
"This movie, which is 3 hours long, is enjoyable and sometimes suffocating, this movie should have been 2.30 hours instead of 3 hours, so that the irregular tempo could be fulfilled.Now, let's get to the editing; the movie makes a time jump in some places and shares sections from a few events that will happen in the future, and these sections, which are meaningless at first, fall into a certain logic after finishing the movie. There was no need for such a thing, but it made it beautiful and exciting.Now let's come to the acting and characters; The acting was excellent and none of the characters grinned. There are two people I would like to congratulate, Matt Damon and Cillian Murphy, who played their characters seriously flawlessly.Visual Design; One of the most curious things about the movie was arguably the use of a real bomb. But before I talk about this bomb, I liked the visual about Quantums more. They were beautifully designed. Yes, now let's come to the bomb; I was a little hopeful here and my hopes were dashed. It was below my expectations."
"Another christopher nolan masterpiece , presenting the story in such a magnificent way to deliver one of the most touching , extremely involving and thrilling experience , the casting is was perfect and the movie was shot in a really captivating manor , just like a typical Nolan film , cillian murphy was outstanding, realistic and emotionally involved , robert downey JR is the perfect cast for lewis straus , RDJ is just phenomenal and the fact that he wasted 13 years in marvel movies is nothing short of sad , but let's hope thet we are getting some quality performances from RDJ just like lewis straus in the upcoming year."
"It is a masterpiece in this manner:
It plays over several years - and in multiple timelines (it's a Nolan of course it does)It also plays at multiple locations over those several years and not ONCE was it felt necessary to show a time or location stamp on screen and it worked brilliantly, I don't believe anyone would mix up the timelines or locations or don't feel like they know where or when they are as an audienceWhat do I mean by this? Well you know - oh now we are at this location"" without the movie telling you Washington - It also isn't the case with - how much time has passed? - no there are optical clues - others than simply aging the characters, more subtle and not forced."
"This film is unlike anything I've ever seen. From start to finish, Nolan's directing and screenwriting, cinematography, and more makes one of the most ambitious, important and beautiful film of all times.An IMAX experience is essential to experience this to the fullest. Fast paced and perfectly paced at the same time. Even the scenes of discussion feel like they are moving fast.Cillian Murphy's performance will win an Oscar.Robert Downey Jr. And Matt Damon both also deliver Oscar worthy performances.This movie will sweep the academy in February.Safe to say, this is one of the greatest films of all time."
"After all, J. Robert Oppenheimer was a unique person. His humanity was absurd, weird, and something nonsense. And, this is spectacularly portrayed by Cillian Murphy and Christopher Nolan.But there are some problems for Christopher Nolan, technically:1. Christopher Nolan's circular non-linear timeline storytelling, for a drama like this, ""isn't new in the cinema."" Even the Japanese have used these several times, for the last 20 years, especially in anime industry.2. The style of plot devices are so European, these are not foreign for European cinema but not usual for American cinema.3. Psychological drama isn't new for the cinema, even Japanese people has pushed it for an anime 2 years ago, the most entertaining genre called idol anime.4. What makes Nolan going authentic in this movie is only the practical visual in the special scenes.5. The film are anti-American and slightly anti-Communist, and yet the most pro-Japanese WWII movie American has co-produced (So no reasons to ban it in Japan, but I don't know if China and Russia ban it then).""... until someone makes a bigger bomb""
Yeah, after all, Christopher Nolan is struggling too on adapting a non-fictional source material. Yet, still hugely appreciated especially for the audiences who only care about American cinema.Christopher Nolan might be culminating the culture of cinema of it, but if you want to discover more and more, you might be realizing then, that's nothing special on the movie, besides of the practical visual in the special scenes."
"The movie is great, the scenes are beautiful. But the screenplay is a really slow burn & often times it falls a bit flat. I guess Nolan went for the character exploration at an emotional level. It sometimes hits, but in the end it falls sort of flat.Its a lot to take in so I think it should have been split into two instead of going for such a long drag. The ending is also not very rewarding for the viewers unlike his other previous ones like the Batman trilogy or Interstellar or even inception.I think its over-hyped. The acting is top notch no doubt about it but the screenplay & pacing is really tedious & jumpy."
"I would've been good money that this was going to be one of the best movies I'd ever watch. But wow. First, the soundtrack plays *constantly* throughout the entire 3 hours. It never stops, and it's very loud, a true assault of the senses. Second, its pacing is crazy-making slow. Even 20 minutes into it, I was thinking 'this has got to get better, right?' Only it never does. The dialog is difficult to hear (largely over the loud music that never stops), and the storyline is not easy to follow. But besides all this, it's just a shockingly boring movie. I'm a big movie fan, and this will go down as one of the worst movies I've ever seen."
"First, I want to record some lines from the movie that highlight the movie in my mind.""-You all thought that I had lost the ability to understand what I'd started. So the award really wasn't for me, it was for all of you hmm?-Now it is your turn, to deal with the consequences of your achievement. And one day, when they have punished you enough, they will serve you salmon and potato salad, make speeches, give you a medal, pat you on the back tell you all is forgiven.-Just remember, it won't be for you, it will be for them. -They need us. / Until they don't.-You think because you let them tar and feature you that the world will forgive you? They won't.""
I am afraid my word and lack of literary skills cannot express my feeling of the movie. Here I want to refer what Nolan has said in the interview to express it.""I think entertainment is a complicated word when it applies to serious subject matter of time. Oppenheimer, the story obviously embraced some of the most awful elements, human exitance and human history. But, to me the word entertainment when you think about motion pictures, it's about engagement, it's about interest. And I think cinema has always historically been able to entertain people in a variety of different ways, not necessarily you know fun and laughs and all the rest. Sometimes it's about engagement. It's about being in a story and experiencing the emotions of those characters and going on an incredible ride.""
""This character story, Oppenheimer's story is the most dramatic story I know of. And harrowing though it is, I think you come out of the other side feeling that you experienced something.""
""Exciting, full of paradox, haunting.""
Yes, Nolan used these three words to describe this movie, and I couldn't agree more. Before I go into the theater, I know it's about history, it's about biograph, and it's Nolan. These three elements already make the reason of watching it. Although 3 hours of English version without any subtitle for a non-English native speaker is such a challenging task, the insufficient of understanding 100% dialogue still didn't make it less splendid.It always come to my mind that a good movie is a movie that get the watcher engaged and lead them to think. And Oppenheimer did it. As Nolan mentioned in the interview, that he had a lot of conversations over the last few months with people involved in artificial intelligence, for example, who literally talked about their Oppenheimer moment.YES, Oppenheimer moment. I saw a comment online, ""does Oppenheimer have a post-credits scene?"", and the most interesting and though-provoking is ""you're living in it, baby."" The movie is more than a documentary-like biography of Oppenheimer himself. But it guides usperhaps a bit, who living in 21 centuries, with all unanticipated-consequence technology involved, to think what we should take response for and how it would be like in a unknown future.I quote all the details of Nolan's interview to give a better overview.""I think the Manhattan Project is somewhat singular in the threat, the immediate threat that it poses to humankind. And that's worth bearing in mind, but having said that, I have had a lot of conversations over the last few months with people involved in artificial intelligence, for example, who literally talked about their Oppenheimer moment. They see this as their Oppenheimer moment. They're looking into his story, to see what guidance or what indicators it could give for, what responsibility they bear for a technology that can have unintended consequences.""
""And I think they're right to look to his story as a cautionary tale, but I've be lying if I certainly thought the film presented any kind of easy answers to these dilemmas. But having people think about it in the right way and think about the potentially devastating and serious results of a new technology. I think it's a very healthy impulse.""
""There are resonances to a movie, the film is not didactic. It's not trying to say there are clear- cut answers.""
Brilliant movie. Not to mention Murphy's brilliant performance and his fascinating blue eyes."
"Everything was great, sound, light, acting, story. Nothing to add BUT, there's one thing that really disappointed me. There's a scene where Oppenheimer teaches in a Dutch town called ""Leiden"" I am Dutch myself and found it really nice to once again encounter something Dutch in a big movie, it just awakes some sort of patriotic flame. But the words he said, they weren't Dutch. It was just some mumbling of vaguely sounding German words. That's a missed opportunity imo. It shows that Hollywood doesn't always wants to je accurate and that's quite disappointing, it also doesn't give the character the right credits, Oppenheimer spoke many languages and should've been credited with his multilingualism."
"And Now I'm Become Death, The Destroyer Of Worlds...""I am a filmmaker & I now realise, that no man is actually capable of putting to expression what they truly feel.I know what I felt, but I've nothing to say.Storytelling couldn't be more refined. The craft of film unlike anything I've ever seen before.The sound design not only impeccable but also revolutionary in the sense of innovation, something that Orson Welles achieved in Citizen Kane.I was promised I'd feel the detonation, I can't really put into words what I felt. But a gaping hole of what it means to be human and more in so many ways unimaginable.Oppenheimer - Christopher Nolan - 1945."
"I'm a physicist and I watched this movie in IMAX (which made a slight difference) after doing my homework. I saw exactly what I expected which was unusual in itself for a Nolan's film. The movie is set at a period when philosophy mattered as much as physics for a scientist. The movie is all about one person who sees the world around him differently. This visionary genius is now under the terrible predicament of finding the most horrible weapon for the greater good which also happens to be his passion, nuclear fission. The same predicament which Krishna put himself under to instigate destruction. Sadly, he is also put on trial for his exact achievement later. So, He has to bare the cross and get crucified for it! Cillian Murphy recreated Oppenheimer like a magician. The tempo of the movie along with its wave-natured background score using it to pump your adrenaline at key moments. Unfortunately, it got to me in the last 30 minutes at which point I felt the movie is starting to get uninteresting. Overall, a must watch for Cillian Murphy."
"I am not gonna use too many words for how great the filming, the acting and the differences in pace were. Because it was all immersive as hell. I love historical knowledge, there was enough of it, but not too much to get completely lost (at least for me). I loved the vibes of progress when they were building the bomb, reminded me of the Alan Turing movie. (Imitation Game). I also loved the endscenes of the trials and all surrounding it. The intensity of such trials always takes me to the end of my seat, very happy this movie included such scenes. I do feel like the movie, or at least certain dialogues tend to paint some black and white paintings on who is the villain and who the hero, which brings empathy that is ofcourse very nice to feel towards protagonists. But not to the extend that you cannot form your own thoughts. I like it a lot that it tackles difficult dilemma's like building a bomb that destroys because your enemy might have it, or being morally against with the fear of it being used against you.There is one thing that really frustrated me and the reason it gets no 10/10, and that is that as a Dutch (flemish) speaker, the Dutch in the movie was German. How can it be that they put so much effort in so many things but finding a Dutch speaking actor, or at least an actor who can fake Dutch well, is such a difficulet thing to do? That is really something i cannot comprehend, especially if your goal is to be historically immersive."
"What can I say. Christopher Nolan is the greatest director of all time and he shows it again in Oppenheimer. A perfectly crafted, wonderfully acted, tense and dense. Christopher Nolan has never made a bad film and this is probably his best directed film. Every shot is beautiful. The music by Ludwig Göransson is one of the best ever put to screen. It adds so much tension to every single scene. Cillian Murphy is excellent as Oppenheimer. He adds so much personality to the character and it portrays him as a deeply flawed, but brilliant and important person in human history. The standout here is Robert Downey Jr. He gets to show all of his acting chops in this movie and it is by far his finest work. His character doesn't share a lot of screen time with Oppenheimer but every scene RDJ's character is on screen the rage he builds is believable thanks to one of the best actors of the 21st century. Every other cast member plays their part is utter perfection. The best performances I have ever seen from Emily Blunt, Tom Conti, Josh Hartnett, Rami Malek just to name a few.Christopher Nolan directs one of his finest works yet and he demonstrates to the world why he should get his first ever Oscar.Masterful film."
"Who'd a thunk that a film about the man who lead the team that created the atomic bomb, would be one of the most brilliant films made in the last decade, and beyond. Christopher Nolan has created a masterpiece of filmmaking, with an impeccable cast, lead by Cilian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt ( all Oscar worthy performances), Matt Damon, Gary Oldman, Florence Pugh, Josh Harnett, Dane DeHaan, Rami Malek, Matthew Modine, Casey Affleck, Tom Conti and many many more.The score, the costumes, the film editing, the sound, the sets, the visual effects, hair and makeup are all superior.One needs to be attentive at all times since the film has many flashbacks and covers the years before World War 2 to many years after the war. The film is basically a bio of J Robert Oppenheimer and how he was employed by the government to lead a team of physicists to develop the bomb before Russia. It is a film of utmost detail and historical relevance. Lengthy and much to absorb, ""Oppenheimer"", will leave you breathless and restore your faith in Hollywood filmmaking, and realize that this Is Christopher Nolan's masterpiece!"
"Any memory you have of any of the actors, you will be walking with them feeling them; Robert Downey Jr. The Is not an iron man anymore, Murphy is not Thomas anymore, and they take acting to a different level in this movie storytelling methodology is impressive. The historical connection between the first scene to the last is mind-blowing; this is an Oscar winner, no doubt.The sound effects are linked to the importance of the scene, and how the bomb explodes and the effects will keep you on the edge of your seats.My only comments is the character of Einstein and the scene where they became old was not that perfect."
"It is the weakest movie of Christopher Nolan but it is still watchable and far better than many movies that came this year and previous years. Thanks to its bgm. Feels like suspense Horror movie, but it's not. Nothing much to say about it's acting. Nothing extra ordinary. Story is Bah. Nothing that you may find exciting. Best thing in entire movie is the bgm. Save your money and watch in ordinary screen, no need of going for IMAX. It's a dialogue heavy and totally a dialogue driven movie. Don't expect great visual as per the current going hype. It's a overhyped movie. Weakest work of Nolan. I think it's the topic or the theme of this movie. What else can you expect. Nolan tried to do his best. Unlike other Nolan movies, It is just, One time watch only, strictly."
"I am not a fan of Christopher Nolan. He ruined Batman, Dunkirk was a mess and his other movies are overly complicated story mad libs. He is a competent director but his brother is a better writer. All that being said... I think this was his best film since Memento.It is not a great film. It's too long, too distracted and too unfocused. It makes sense it was based off a historical biography, because it has no clear plot. It also doesn't work as a biopic because we don't really learn anything about Oppenheimer over the movie except he was 'brilliant' and had a high opinion of himself. He knew Communists ( on a college campus, go figure) so that's drama I guess. He was a womanizer, maybe too smart for his own good? Character traits that scrape the surface but are never fully explored. RDJ does a phenomenal job as the secondary main player but you are never quite sure who he is or what he's doing in the story.Basically the 'drama' or conflict is non-existent. A bunch of know it all scientists disagree with one another- that's basically the extent of the conflict. We all know the stakes of the Manhattan Project but here it's almost a background objective. No real drama or stakes that the audience can invest in.Like a lot of reviewers I can concur that the editing is distracting. You can follow it but it's tedious. It could've been done so much better. It's like Nolan makes the narrative intentionally confusing because that's what his audience expects. That or he doesn't know how to tell a straight front to back narrative. Like much of the film it just comes across as unnecessarily grandiose.Remember mini-series in the '80's or the disaster films of Irwin Allen or the Loveboat? That's kind of how this film felt with Cameos. Oh, look it's Rami Malek - I wonder if he already had his Oscar because it's such a small part. Is that Gary Oldman as Truman? Didn't he win an Oscar for playing Churchill? Will he not be satisfied until he plays all Allied leaders? Those are thoughts I had while watching the film. That's how distracting the cameos are. I did enjoy seeing Macon Blair in a high pedigree film. Blue Ruin was awesome! But I digress... James Remar showed up and I thought he was Truman at first but after about 3 minutes into the scene I realized he was Henry Stimson. It took another two minutes before he was addressed as such by another character. That's why I was frustrated. Title cards; time stamps, Characters cards would be helpful but Nolan is a 'genius' so his audience must be as well.The score was annoying and never shut up to let us focus for any length of time. The sound design was good but also distracting because it was emphasized more than the actual story. The frame was too close to the action all of the time. I guess it's meant to create a sense of intimacy but there are too many characters who we don't know and the timeline jumps around so much (from color to Black and White also) that times, places and events are hardly established. Only because we see certain settings over and over again (over 3 hours) do we start to figure out where some things are (Congress, the security renewal panel etc.)I did say it was his best film since Memento, this is because it's based off something real and not a comic book, a fictional novel or a specifically weird and unnecessarily complicated premise. The performances were good. I can see Murphy getting an Oscar. He was fantastic but we just never got to know much about the actual man, that's my only problem with that Character. RDJ is fantastic as (spoiler) the antagonist. This is meant to be a twist at the end and does kind of work as an insight into the kind of egos among elite science/government types. Shades of Fauchi. Matt Damon was good but underused. Same with Emily Blunt. Casey Affleck was in this but for the life of me I don't know what his character had to do with anything. This film was too bloated. Too many characters and no real plot.The bomb gets made and we win the war. Huzzah! But wait, people die and he feels...sad maybe? Much like Oppenheimers actual politics, it's never really made clear. Yes, he's the hero hailed as the 'father of the atom bomb' but he has no real voice in how they are used. He realizes that he can't put the genie back in the bottle. Some criticism feels they don't show the horrors of the bombs enough and Nolan made a deliberate choice to focus on the man and not the actual carnage (though it is alluded to in a dreamlike way). I can respect that choice at least. It's not a war film. It's not an anti-war film. It's a bio pic that plays more like an overly stylish and overlong HBO film. If this were any other director this film would be a solid 6. But since it's Nolan the fanboys are calling it a masterpiece, it ain't. While I don't think it's a home run it is a solid swing that misses more that it hits (for me anyway) but I respect the effort. Einstein was the most entertaining character in my opinion. See it for Florence Pughs tits if nothing else, they get about as much screen time as the actual explosion."
"Christopher Nolan's exploration of the life of American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer in his latest film offers a gripping portrayal of the moral complexities surrounding the development of the atomic bomb. The movie delves into Oppenheimer's integral role in the creation of this devastating weapon and his subsequent ethical dilemma, symbolizing the clash between scientific advancement and the horrors of mass destruction.Nolan's masterful direction employs a nonlinear storytelling approach, skillfully interweaving Oppenheimer's personal struggles with the broader historical and political context of the era. This narrative technique magnificently captures the intricate layers of the American perspective on nuclear weaponry, from its initial allure to the haunting realization of its catastrophic potential.At the heart of the film is Oppenheimer's profound internal conflict, portrayed with remarkable depth by the cast. His devastation at witnessing the destructive aftermath of the atom bomb leads him to question the moral implications of his work, adding a poignant layer to his character development. The movie poignantly captures Oppenheimer's gradual marginalization as his security clearance is unjustly revoked, fueled by unfounded allegations linking him to the Russian Communist Party.Navigating the intricacies of global politics, American economic interests, and the alliances formed during World War II, the film demands a certain level of familiarity with these subjects to fully appreciate its nuances. Furthermore, the incorporation of physics and the associated political dynamics adds depth and authenticity to the story, making it a thought-provoking experience for those well-versed in these areas.Central to the narrative's compelling trajectory is the American government's systematic erosion of Oppenheimer's credibility and renown. This calculated diminution stemmed from his steadfast refusal to endorse and engage in the development of the hydrogen bomb, a stance emblematic of his moral convictions. The narrative adeptly navigates the labyrinthine corridors of power, shedding light on the egregious measures taken to tarnish Oppenheimer's reputation. Accusations of association with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union were wielded as potent weapons, a perfidious ploy aimed at both discrediting his intellectual eminence and miring him in a web of unwarranted suspicion.Moreover, the film astutely underscores the degrading influence exerted upon his contemporaries, an insidious attempt to undermine his standing within the scientific community. By unraveling these intricate layers of subterfuge and manipulation, Nolan crystallizes the complex interplay between political machinations, personal integrity, and scientific inquiry. This intellectual odyssey, while demanding a nuanced comprehension of global geopolitics, American sociopolitical currents, and the intricate fusion of physics and politics, stands as a profound exposition of the human struggle at the nexus of ethics and knowledge.A standout feature of the film is its captivating musical score, by Ludwig Göransson with his trademark precision. The music seamlessly complements the emotional depth of the narrative, enhancing the overall impact of the storytelling.Situated within Christopher Nolan's illustrious filmography, this cinematic venture emerges as a testament to the director's consummate storytelling acumen. Emanating as his most formidable achievement, it adeptly weaves historical intricacies, ethical quandaries, and personal tribulations into an enthralling narrative that leaves an indelible mark. With its intricate stratifications, resonant thematic undertones, and superlative execution, Nolan's probing exploration of Oppenheimer's existence and enduring impact incontrovertibly solidifies its stature as a preeminent cinematic opus."
"I've been following the filmography of Chris nolan from prestige and he's been a absolute banger when it comes to story telling in a non linear format, on that line oppenheimer hits an another amazing banger in theaters, and he is the only director who can direct a biography in a most exiting way possible and succeeded in it but the only flaw in the movie where i observed in his previous movie after interstellar is that, the audio mixing and sound quality is very poor and recollection of what a character trying to say feels very difficult to grasp, this issues persists for his past movies like Dunkirk and tenet, apart from this i absolutely loved the movie and waiting for his next announcement 👍🏻"
"When I went to watch the movie, i knew it was gonna blow my mind. After all it's directed by Christopher goddamn Nolan. And the movie did just that. The best part about the movie is it's cinematography and sound fx. Nolan poured his heart into the movie as he usually does for any other movie. The way the story was told was very Nolan like and that is the signature of the movie. And the actors!! Cillian is exceptionally brilliant in this movie. He projected his emotions, Oppenheimer's emotions brilliantly. I would also like to mention RDJ and Emily blunt's performance which was goddamn perfect!"
"First of all, the actors did their best in this movie especially Cillian Murphy in many scenes throughout the movie, Robert Downey Jr was also stunning with his role and did it perfectly.And the choice of the director to avoid using CGI is very important for the movie since it's meant to be a biography movie.Of course can't forget the soundtracks and music choice is very suiting for this movie in particular and I just love it.Moreover, the scene of the trinity test kept me stunned, the silence and the shock wave after it's just perfect.Finally, the movie is very good and it's expected since it's directed by Christopher Nolan.Note: I recommend giving it a rewatch if you didn't like it that much."
"Oppenheimer is one of the best cinematic experiences l've ever had. The storytelling is a controlled detonation of historical events, brilliantly balancing fact and fiction to create an incredible tale that captures J. Robert Oppenheimer's life.The sound design is an absolute assault on the senses, the explosion action sequences through the theater
Cast peak, cinematography peak, background score peak, all were peak.The visuals on 70mm left me speechless, every frame from Hoyte van Hoytema is a visual masterpiece.I don't even have words to describe how perfect this role is for him, Cillian Murphy is always a phenomenal actor in Nolan's direction, hoping he'll be nominated for Best Actor in Oscars'2024 3 hours was totally worth it
All Hail Lord Nolan *"
Christopher Nolan's best work till date. Cillian Murphy is phenomenal. Mr. Murphy's performance was breathtaking and exceptional. Him as J. Robert Oppenheimer is one of the best choices ever made in cinema history. Cillian Murphy 's performance is extraordinary in this movie. The screenplay is tremendous and unique. The dialogues in this movie is very powerful. Best writing by Christopher Nolan.the way suspense and thrill was built in this movie i have no words.it is This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole time. Each and every actor and actress gave excellent performance. You will feel like you were there and everything is happening infront of your eyes. This is not just a movie it is an experience. There is so much to absorb from this movie. Truly a 10/10 movie. I felt things that i have never felt before while watching this movie. I was emotional moved by this masterpiece. Got goosebumps while watching it. Absolutely loved loved loved this movie. The experience is unforgettable and extraordinary. Glad i did go to watch the movie (2 times)
"The characters felt real and relatable. The movie had a perfect mix of emotions, making me laugh cry, and feel inspired. The cinematography was stunning, and the music added an extra layer of depth to the whole experience. I almost forgot to mention the the insanely talented the extremely good Cillian Murphy. His performance was incredible, and his expressive eyes added so much depth to the character. I was completely drawn into the emotions he portrayed through his eyes, making the movie even more powerful and unforgettable. Cillian Murphy's talent is truly mesmerizing, and it's one of the reasons why I adore this film so much."
"First, this is a visually stunning movie. I heard an interview where Nolan said going to the movies should be a visual experience first..he delivers. The bigger the screen the better. Sound, effects, and story are great but like all sound these days, the score tends to overpower the dialogue. Nolan's characteristic nonlinear story telling is ever present. If you hate flashbacks and jumps in time, you have to suck it up. The tension between Oppy and Teller over the ""h-bomb"" is a great sub-plot. Dr Lawrence of ""Lawrence-Livermore"" labs is seen more in this film than in other versions of the Manhattan project. Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and Robert Downey will earn nominations for their performances when award season rolls around."
"I saw Oppenheimer, starring Cillian Murphy-Peaky Blinders_tv, the Dark Knight movies; Emily Blunt-Jungle Cruise, Edge of Tomorrow; Matt Damon-Air, We Bought a Zoo and Robert Downey Jr.-Dolittle, the Marvel movies.This movie is based on the true story of Robert Oppenheimer and his part in creating the Atomic bomb. It's directed by Christopher Nolan-Tenet, Dunkirk, the Dark Knight movies-and stars Cillian as Oppenheimer. It covers his attributes and brilliance in science, as well as his not so noble faults, like his womanizing-he had affairs while still being married. Emily plays his wife. There were also accusations of Cillian being a communist, which were investigated when the US government approached him to head up the project of creating a bomb to end WW2. Matt plays the soldier in charge and Robert plays a politician. There are several other cameos of recognizable actors in smaller parts. It is an interesting story but a little slow for my tastes. My brother liked it more than I did.It's rated R for language, smoking and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 3 hours.It's not one that I would buy on DVD to watch over and over again but if you are interested in the history of it, it would be a good one to stream."
Chernobyl on Max is a thousand times better than this scam of a movie. Perfect example of false advertising. They keep it fast paced so you'll be tricked into thinking its a good movie. Probably a suggestion by the studio so audiences don't lose interest. Cillian Murphy is a great actor. That's the only positive thing i have to say about this boring garbage. All the cameos are out of place along with the sex scenes. Nolan should never be allowed to cast another movie. He got lucky with Heath Ledger. If you liked this movie then you're pretentious and a sucker. 20 year old documentaries on the subject are more interesting. If want a Nolan/atom bomb sized explosions...you'll be very disappointed. I'm depressed at the thought of Barbie probably being a better movie. I look forward to your downvotes.
"Oppenheimer, the latest magnum opus by renowned director Christopher Nolan, is a cinematic achievement that transcends the boundaries of both science and history. This epic drama delves into the complex life and work of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist and key figure behind the creation of the atomic bomb during World War II. Nolan's direction, coupled with a stellar cast and awe-inspiring visuals, delivers a thought-provoking and emotionally charged experience that leaves a lasting impact on the audience.The film's strength lies in its meticulous attention to historical accuracy while artfully incorporating Nolan's signature storytelling techniques. The narrative chronicles Oppenheimer's personal journey, from his early academic pursuits to his leading role in the Manhattan Project. Through well-crafted flashbacks and dreamlike sequences, the audience gains insight into the physicist's inner struggles, moral dilemmas, and his ultimate realization of the devastating power of his creations.Cillian Murphy delivers an astonishing performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer, skilfully portraying the character's brilliant mind, emotional turmoil, and the burden of responsibility that weighs heavily on his shoulders. Murphy's portrayal humanizes the enigmatic figure, presenting Oppenheimer not as a cold scientist, but as a man grappling with the moral implications of his inventions, which have forever changed the course of history show the true and important store of a flawed genius.The supporting cast, including Emily Blunt as Kitty, Oppenheimer's wife, and Robert Downy Jr as Friend and professor turn sourer by the ever present jealousy and blindness to Oppenheimers greatness and character as can be seen in the world peace scene over the transportation of isotopes. RDJ gives us a phenonpnal performance which helps to silence the critics over what seems to be a radical change in character compared to the roles he is used to playing. Provide stellar performances that add depth and dimension to the story. Their relationships with Oppenheimer are portrayed with nuance, contributing to the film's emotional resonance.Oppenheimer's thematic brilliance lies in Nolan's exploration of the dichotomy between scientific achievement and ethical consequences. As the Manhattan Project gains momentum, the film delves into the ethical debates surrounding the use of atomic weapons and the harrowing aftermath of their deployment in Japan. Nolan does not shy away from depicting the devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, providing a haunting reminder of the consequences of unchecked scientific progress.Nolan's directorial vision is further elevated by the seamless incorporation of practical effects, setting Oppenheimer apart from contemporary CGI-heavy productions. The authenticity of the explosions and nuclear tests serves as a poignant reminder of the real-world impact of the events portrayed on screen.Moreover, Oppenheimer's nonlinear narrative keeps the audience engaged throughout, allowing them to piece together the puzzle of Oppenheimer's life while highlighting the complexities of the human mind and the passage of time.As with any Nolan film, Oppenheimer demands the audience's attention and intellectual engagement. Its dense storyline and non-linear structure may prove challenging for some viewers, but those willing to invest in the narrative will be rewarded with a film that leaves a profound and thought-provoking impression.In conclusion, Oppenheimer is a triumphant cinematic achievement that cements Christopher Nolan's status as a master storyteller. The film is a compelling exploration of history, science, and morality, driven by stellar performances, mesmerizing visuals, and an evocative score. Nolan's ability to blend fiction with historical accuracy while maintaining emotional resonance is truly remarkable. Oppenheimer is a must-watch for cinema enthusiasts, history buffs, and anyone intrigued by the moral dilemmas posed by scientific advancement. It is a profound and unforgettable experience that will linger in the minds of audiences for years to come. So to answer the question, yes I do believe that Oppenheimer will be cemented as a classic in the future."
"Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" is an extraordinary cinematic achievement that delves into the complex life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the renowned physicist often referred to as ""the father of the atomic bomb."" This haunting and thought-provoking film masterfully captures a pivotal shift in human consciousness over the course of three gripping hours. As a drama that explores the themes of genius, hubris, and the consequences of individual and collective errors, it immerses viewers in the turbulent journey of Oppenheimer, whose research and development of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki forever changed the world."
"Brilliant acting all around. As an old Army Veteran I enjoyed Matt Damon as the General in charge and Oppie's confidant. The character development was wonderful including suspicious Teller and reliable friend Lawrence.Having watched the great msnbc documentary last week, I was in my mind expecting a more linear portrayal of the historic events and lead up. Perhaps there was a bit too much artistic license used here.The constant flashback scenes were difficult to follow - and I was focused. The use of color vs B&W didn't seem to have a pattern to timeframe or events. The music seemed too dominant while the dialogue was often hard to pickup and decipher (accents and jargon).The last hour seemed anti-climatic following the atomic bomb destruction, and it wasn't clear what RDJ's important Lewis Strauss character's motives were.But the most important parts of the story were presented directly - the initial exuberance of supporting their country in wartime, the brilliant planning and teamwork, the beautiful Los Alamos location, the unknowns of fusion and fission, and the realization that this terrible bomb would not prevent future wars - and the paranoia it set off vis a vis the ""communist threat"" were all wonderfully presented.I just feel like this important story would have benefitted by being told in a linear time fashion. A very relevant story in todays world - and Russia remains as the unpredictable bad character."
"This movie was brilliant all around. The director, the actors, the story, and the soundtrack. For individuals that want a mindless fluff piece - this is not the movie for them.This movie focus on a brilliant mind, history, patriotism, and the truth about politics. Also, it shows the humanity, brilliance and fear in making a bomb of mass destruction. It also reveals how a simple narrative/lie can change the trajectory of someone's life and career.Nolan nailed it and Cillian was brilliant. All Americans should watch this movie. I am still dumbfounded how Barbie is doing better at the box office than this masterpiece."
"I liked this movie maybe because it shows how human is Robert Oppenheimer. Honestly, I had little to no idea about him and his achievements and his life prior to watching this movie and I do not really know how accurate this movie was.For me it was nice to see how he is not just a picture on a book or in the internet or how he could just be briefly described as the Father of the Atomic Bomb. But how he is just like anyone else, human just like me, who had struggles just like everybody else.The movie was interesting and even if it was just a bunch of dialogues thrown around. Christopher Nolan is really a great director. He even made someone like me engrossed in the movie, who is not usually into biopics and do not know much about history. I guess it was also thanks to Cillian Murphy who did a great job depicting his character. It was not Cillian I saw but the actual father of the atomic bomb. After the movie I watched a few clips about him because I became interested in him and the happenings back in WWII.I rated it 8 though because I could not really understand the some of the dialogues. The accents were heavy and I am not a native english speaker.Well anyway I hope Christopher Nolan creates a spin off on the other side of the spectrum."
"Watched Oppenheimer. Absolute spectacle fit for watching on a big screen. The whole cast was perfect. Cillian Murphy gives the performance of his career. A shoe in for his first Oscar. Watching RDJ on screen was Cherry on the top, Oscar on the way for him too. Emily Blunt did a fantastic job too.Light travels faster than sound. Mr. Nolan not only made a terrific bomb explosion scene but also he followed the science for the speed of light and sound here. Quite possibly Christopher Nolan's tightest screenplay till date. Top notch BGM, spectacular visuals and Cris Nolan's special nonlinear story telling overall Christopher Nolan dropped an ATOM BOMB."
"I'm a massive Nolan fan and won't give this a 10 because I don't even think he'd want it. As a Director and cinematographer he continually pushes the boundaries in search of perfection and wants his team and the actors to go with him. Sometimes he'll win and sometimes he won't but he doesn't patronise his audience. Yet again this is another of his films where you'll need a second or third viewing to fully enjoy the nuances and interactions that evolve. Murphy leads brilliantly and all the support and ensemble cast are portrayed very well. The script is deep and the meaning that one can take from the experience is multi-layered. The movie has different facets that will appeal from the use of colour and B/W to the powerful score. The sound is amazing in IMAX albeit can overwhelm the narrative (a recent and I'd say valid gripe against Nolan). The story arc is not linear, a classic Nolan feature which I like and the pay-off is haunting. For me this ending is as close as one can get to a movie about pacifism albeit you'd never have felt that for most of the entire film!!!"
"This is the first Nolan movie I've seen. He really has a way with actors as every performance is stellar. You aren't looking at the star, you're looking at the character. I am quite familiar with Oppenheimer's life and I'm not sure I would have emphasized the same aspects of his life but Nolan made his choices and the movie is very effective, but perhaps not very moving.Robert Downey Jr really stands out. He brought that character to life. Cillian Murphy did a great job portraying Oppenheimer who was such a complex character. He was in pretty well every scene surrounded by amazing actors yet he always stood out. I noticed he snuck in a few Peaky Blinder mannerisms too!I'm not sure the non-linear format was wholly successful. The progression from deeply disturbed student to brilliant but caustic professor to skilled manager of a huge collection of enormous egos to the final showdown with the lesser people he bruised on the way is confusing enough without getting it in random chunks. I was familiar with Oppenheimer's history so I could follow it, but my wife was getting a bit lost with all the characters.My wife also didn't know that the H bomb and the atomic bomb were two different things, which plays a significant role in the story, so that also added to the confusion.I saw it in 70mm regular and it looked great. The colour seemed to change depending on when the action took place, with slightly washed out images with crushed blacks in the thirties, full Technicolor in the forties and ""Color by Kodak"" in the fifties and sixties. The dialogue is sometimes a bit hard to understand though because of the strange timbre that body mics give to a voice. Maybe next time Nolan will go back to boom mics to complement his use of film."
"I think this movie got really good actors, it saves the movie but it was really boring. It's too much, 3 hours movie. After the test of the bomb, it became hard to watch. Nothing else was interesting.Also it bothered me the parts when they show future and past intercaleted. It would be so much better if it showed only past in some parts.The movie got cool effects, good actors and acting. The bad parts, too long, loses focus in some parts and make it tiring to watch.Maybe I would give more points if I watched it at home, with some breaks.Another idea, it could easily be a netflix series."
"The story was just all over the place. I could barely understand anything the characters were saying, mostly due to the overbearing sound of the score. I can't even begin to say how evil these types of films are to people. Let alone men who watch this thinking that they too can become something of themselves. Of course, Nolan is the most misogynistic he could ever be having women characters who spout about nothing more than Men. It's just pathetic and in no way do I think these films will hold up. Maybe as a means to see some glimpse of a historical event, but nothing more than that. No heart. No thing to latch on to. No interest whatsoever in Nolan's interests at all. I'd rather see Spielberg direct this film, god forbid."
"Oppenheimer is a movie about the father of the atomic bomb and the war world 2 and how they created the atomic bomb and what is the consequences they got, the first thing I noticed in the movie that you need to know about the world war 2 and the thing that happened that time and i known some people will don't like the movie because it's long but if you like a movie about history and physics this movie is the best for you, the movie was terrifying and I remember my heart was beating so hard and i was very nervous and the best thing that nolan make us feel how the bomb felt when it explode, this movie will be the best movie I've ever seen and experience, this day will be never forgotten in my memory thank you nolan for doing this movie."
"Maded with care and skill by a master like Christopher Nolan, the film delivers an incredible and thought-provoking experience. With some exellence performances from a talented cast and a captivating story.Cillian Murphy delivers an unforgettable performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer, portraying his complex character with depth and sensitivity.Visually, Oppenheimer is an aesthetic delight. Christopher Nolan's talent for creating grandiose imagery and using the visual aspects of the film to tell the story shines through. Scenes from the laboratories, the experimental trials, and the detonation of the atomic bomb are extraordinarily executed.The only critique is that the film's intricate plot and its shifts between present and past was challenging for me to follow. However, this element also adds to the film's complexity and the highlights Oppenheimer experiences.Oppenheimer deserves its place as one of the most thought-provoking films of the year and earns a well-deserved 9/10 rating."
"There are two words to describe Oppenheimer: cinematic masterpiece. None of the achievements of this film could be done without writer/director Christopher Nolan. The script is absolutely phenomenal. It's a dialogue heavy three-hour film, but the tension and master class writing created by Nolan keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The score by Ludwig Goransson is fantastic, as it also helps build tension in almost every scene. The film jumps before, after, and during the testing of the atomic bomb, but it is surprisingly not too difficult to follow, and it is kept extremely interesting throughout. Another thing to note is the absence of CGI in the film, which is mind-blowing to think about after you've seen it. There are tons of shots showing close ups of the explosion, atoms, neutrons, etc., which you would think Nolan would use CGI for, but he doesn't, and all of these shots are visually stunning. It is just such an amazing accomplishment. Another key factor in this movie is the incredible acting from everyone involved. There are tons of A-list actors sprinkled throughout, some even just having one scene, and they all give great performances. One in particular is Tom Conti as Albert Einstein. Einstein is in a scene at the beginning, middle, and end, but the impact he has on the film is really memorable and impressive. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer just needs to win Best Actor. His performance summed up in one word is haunting. He haunts with his eyes, the way he delivers his lines, and the way he just stares. He really shows the audience how depressed and miserable Oppenheimer was particularly after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Robert Downey Jr also shows how he isn't just Tony Stark, but an incredible actor with a wide range. Everyone involved absolutely deserves an award; the film is that great. Nolan's biopic Oppenheimer proves he is one of the great directors of all time."
"Oppenheimer is the greatest movie of this century! 10/10The whole movie is amazing, running side by side with perfection Fascinating story, But the highlight for me must be the scenes between (Oppenheimer and Einstein) Cillian Murphy seeing him in a lead role and his performance as Oppenheimer was magnificent absolutely stunning. Overall Nolan did phenomenal work on this project by casting all the talented actors and they each one of them gave their best performances in this film, as always Christopher Nolan is one of the greatest directors of all time mad respect for this GeniusIt is highly recommended to watch it in imax theaters if possible."
"This is a well-made movie, highly recommended, definitely Oscar worthy. I would have rated it higher, except for the IMAX experience. I would recommend seeing this in a regular theater. The low frequency, loud rumbling sound was so distracting that it actually obscured the conversations between the actors sometimes. This is a movie where the conversations mean everything, and for the sound engineer to overplay the low frequency rumbling was simply not necessary.Most of the casting was brilliantly done. Cillian Murphy was extraordinary, using Gary Oldman for Truman was brilliant, Emily Blunt was superb, Matt Damon was perfect for the role of the general.I am actually looking forward to seeing this movie again in either a closed-caption theater, or at home with closed captions turned on. The sound goes from way too loud, immediately to a scene with low volume conversations that I just desperately wanted to hear."
"This movie makes you wanna' hate America, but it certainly will make you love Nolan, and the brilliant cast. The story alone is incredible, so when I heard that they were making this movie, I thought this could go in both directions, depending on who's directing it. When I saw that it was Chistopher Nolan, I knew the movie was in the best hands, and that this would become another masterpiece. And boy, was I right. Nolan never disappoints his audience.Specially when you know that this movie won't be ruined by CGI. In fact, for those who know Nolan's work, he's all about practical effects that makes everything feel more real. Because they mostly are.Of course I knew he didn't set off a real atomic bomb, but it really left me longing to see how real it would feel, since there's no CGI. When I watched that atomic bomb go off in the movie, no computer can match that, as far as I've seen. It was mind blowing. I swear I literally jumped in my seat when the bang from the speakers hit me. And the way they built up to that moment, with the intense music and sound effects, my heart was just hammering in my chest.Although the first part of the movie is mainly science and theories, Nolan tells it in such a interesting way, you don't get bored. At least I didn't. There are some iconic scientists I didn't know was involved in this story, that I thought was very interesting, and throughout the movie you get the opportunity to see all the truly hard work these people went through, all the anger, sorrows, how it affects them in good and very bad ways. I take my hat off for the amazing actors, under the steady hands of Nolan, that made me as an audience feel all that. Of course beautifully accompanied with the intense and powerful, yet stunningly beautiful music from the amazing Swedish composer, Ludwig Göransson (also know from The Mandalorian). When Robert (Oppenheimer) gets stabbed in the back by the American government, I could feel the sorrow he went through. I could feel the anger and hate building up in me.Along with the new Avatar movie, Oppenheimer is by far among the best movies I've seen in a long time. You know, there's iconic movies like The Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, Lord Of The Rings, Titanic, Star Wars, even Marvel's End Game, among others who just blew up the movie industry, and into that collection - now there's Oppenheimer."
"The movie is great, 3 hours of them are more than two hours, I am in awe of what is happening and what will happen, but the rest of the time, which was about a third or half an hour, was a bit boring, but despite this boredom... after I finished the movie.. I don't feel that they are crowded with wellness or they can be deleted.The cast is great, and Cillian Murphy deserves this role, a well-deserved tribute to a great actor, and one of Nolan's loyal soldiers, Robert Downey Jr. Gives us a performance from his golden age, and the rest of the actors are at their best.. in addition to an additional hero, which is the sound effects.As for the simple negative needs in the experiment, they are:
1) Somewhat after the bombing, which almost exploded at the end of the second third of the movie, the interrogation of Oppenheimer begins in the last third, and the first half of the last third was boring for me, but then I got better until the movie's great ending.2) The sound effects were great, but the music was exaggeratedly loud times.3) The scene of the explosion is very good, but.. with all due respect, we resorted to realistic explosions, but on the computer I could have made it more grandiose, because visually I felt that it was a large explosion, not a giant one, and the shape of a mushroom's nest lasted for two seconds in the middle of the slow motion of the fire.The visual effects that were in Oppenheimer's imagination at the beginning of the movie were great in the full sense of the word! .. Why not seek help like this in fast or slow motion? And show the process sequence? Etc?But in the end, and as a complete experience, I was very happy with it. Greatness compensated for the frustration I felt after Tenet and Dunkirk. Hats off to Nolan."
"When Einstein says to Oppenheimer ""It's yours, not mine"", it actually sums up the whole movie. Nolan's Questionable depiction of women characters aside, the movie is a cinematic masterpiece. The story evolves slowly and takes it to a logical conclusion. The biggest victory of the movie is that the Trinity test although a very central to the movie but not the most important one.This movie gives a life to a partially known historical figure who being one of the pioneers of quantum physics in US and theory of black holes is remembered only by the deadly toy he discovered. May be it's time to know him again through the eyes of the director."
"I honestly expected it to be a lot better. For me, it doesn't live up to the hype and the 10/10s.Its a 3 hour long movie with a heavy heavy subject and a lot of characters. I was struggling for the first hour of the film because I found it to be very boring. Story line was all over the place, it wasn't cohesive at all and we were introduced to many characters that weren't really relevant for the plot.If you expect to see a movie about the most significant and tragic event od modern history, the atomic bombing, you won't be very pleased. From my point of view, Nolan made a movie to the point of a love letter to the great scientist who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. He portrayed Oppenheimer as an honest man of many interests, with a deep sense of morality but failed to bring any sort of depth or emotion. The only two women characters are meaningless to the plot and made out to be hysterical. The whole thing seemed flat.Regardless, it's a high quality film and production with great acting, but prepared to be frustrated and drained after seeing it."
"Robert Oppenheimer... so many stories! Let me tell them all! That seems to be the thinking by director Christopher Nolan, whose directing principles do not include ""kill your darlings"". Not judging by this three hour, oh so slow movie containing a ridiculous number of talking heads.And so we end up with a partially very shallow story, driven by dialogue mixed sometimes with sound effects and not much else, apart from some pretty cynical nude shots of one of Oppenheimer's mistresses.There is a lot to Oppenheimer. His political views. His brilliant physics. His affairs. His ego. His mental issues. The ethics. The persecution. And the reinstallation as a national hero.All of this is covered pretty briefly in the movie, which in the end be centered around some politician played by Robert Downey jr. And which is by far the least interesting part of Oppenheimer's life.Emily Blunt portrays a strong, incredibly patient wife (or maybe she had nowhere to turn) who brings some of the best questions to the screen.Oppenheimer's dilemmas are so many, there is never time to delve into them, even through three long hours. So we are left with loads of unanswered questions, even after this slog.The relationship with the general played by Matt Damon could have been another centre of this movie - two men with completely different background and ideas, brought together to stop all wars.Casey Affleck drops by in a few scenes with an interesting character, never to be seen again. Einstein is present in just a few, yet important scenes, and though that works well, I felt there was more to their relationship that could have been explored.The director gets too obsessed with McCarthyism. A shame. It is a pretty well known story, and got way too much space, I thought. There are so many depositions and testimonies, it never ends.A two hour story centered around Oppenheimer, his wife and the general would have been so much better.Great actors all around, Murphy must surely be an Oscar candidate. A shame the editing wasn't of the same standard."
"I mean just a masterpiece christerfer Nolan did it again. The camera the acting, it made me want to learn more. Robert Downey jr and Matt Damon amazing. I can't forget about cilian Murphy wonderful acting.It is beutiful film that has no mistakes, Emily blunt did great, can't wait for the next Christopher Nolan movie probably better. But it is hard to beat this one, Oppenheimer is a great character. You feel like your there in his place.This would also be a great book, there probably is one, what a movie and I would really want to rewatch when it comes out on Apple t,, must watch beutiful film, have a great time."
"I don't usually take the time to talk about movies I enjoy but man did I enjoy this. Everything from the no use of CGI and the effects instead made you just think ""wow"". Not to mention Cillian Murphys performance is incredible. It really keeps you glued to the screen at all time between the cutscenes and the constant new acts each making you wonder what comes next.Something that made me more amazed than anything is how this movie captures the true horror of the Atomic Bomb. Each scene progresses through the movie and show how it has made and impact on history all by this man.Lastly the end... wow. It was simply an amazing touch to an amazing movie."
"The story and timeline jumps are amazing.The acting is best part of the movie.The first half is good but story excels in second half.Few scenes and how they are shown are just amazing.Not the best of Nolan but Oscar worthy.Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr and Emily blunt are just amazing. They may get Oscars for their performances.The direction is just amazing. Few scenes where Oppenheimer is realizing what he has created and what impact will it have are pure gems. This one has great shot at best director Oscar.The atomic bomb blast was not CGI but how it is shown on camera is just amazing."
"Watched Oppenheimer in imax, packed cinema. Let me tell you something: when a movie makes you feel certain emotions and forget that you're in a movie then you know that the director did his best. Nolan said: If you don't understand my movie try to feel it, oh boy have I felt it the whole 3hours and 9 seconds of it, and it went so quick I was ready for more. I was worried, scared, laughed, felt anxious and angry. Went through a lot in those 3 hours. Now that was quite the experience. And that's the point of it I guess, that's exactly what I wanted. My opinion is that this film is a masterpiece.."
"Oppenheimer has been one of the most anticipated movies of 2023. With an award-winning cast, Director of Photography Hoyte van Hoytema and composer Ludwig Göransson, many fans hoped that Oppenheimer would be as fascinating as Nolan's older productions - and it is.First of all, the movie is produced in a technically outstanding way. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is good, though not as masterful as Wally Pfister's cinematography in older Nolan movies such as The Dark Knight (2008) or Inception (2010). Van Hoytema often shows close-ups of Oppenheimer's face, which draws the viewer right into his thoughtfulness and into his emotions. The movie looks amazing and one can really feel the tension, especially in IMAX theaters.Furthermore, Ludwig Göransson's score ist just amazing. It underlines the tension of the movie as well as the characters emotions and thoughts in an incredible way and really draws the viewer into the story. The music is beautiful and together with van Hoytema's cinematography, the viewers find themselves in a stunning atmosphere.Secondly, the actors perform brilliantly. Especially Cillian Murphy's performance as Oppenheimer is exceptional. Even though he changes his facial expressions only slightly, he conveys so much of the inner thoughts and emotions of Oppenheimer through his eyes - truly outstanding. It would not be surprising to me if he wins an Oscar for this performance, I haven't seen any better eye-acting yet!Already on the first images that were released from the film one could see that he was the perfect pick for Oppenheimer's role. Wearing a hat and having a cigarette in the corner of his mouth the resemblance to the real physicist is remarkable.Moreover, also Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss does an incredible job. Of course he has shown many times that he is an exceptional actor but this performance still tops his performances in older films.All in all, the whole cast does a great job. Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer, Matt Damon as Leslie Groves or Rami Malek as Dr. Hill, they all show how talented they are and all serve a masterful performance.All of Nolan's movies stand out with an incredible cast, but Oppenheimer tops all of them. Many actors would deserve an Oscar for their performance - even those who only had a few minutes on the screen.However, let's talk about the storytelling. Oppenheimer is based on the biography ""American Prometheus: The triumph and tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer"". The 3h long movie, which can be separated into three acts, consists mostly of dialogue scenes. Nolan uses a creative approach and filmed on coloured and black-and-white film to distinguish between a more personal and a more objective view.Just like in his other films, Nolan wants to encourage the viewer to think. Even though the story is not as complex as for instance Tenet's story, one cannot just sink in the seat and relax. Nolan wants to challenge the viewer, he wants him to think on his own and develop an own opinion on the topic. And yes, because of the many important dialogues and the abundance of physicists and other people that play a role in the movie, it may seem quite overwhelming at first. Every scene takes an important role in the development of the movie and cannot be missed. In general, the storytelling is on-point, creative and convincing.Nevertheless, whereas action scenes in Inception or Tenet or silent shots of the intergalactic space in Interstellar allowed the viewers to process what they just saw, Oppenheimer just goes on and on. As a consequence, there is only limited space for feelings to grow and the movie seems almost too mathematically planned for an
emotionally touching biopic.Furthermore, in my opinion, the movie is a little bit overpacked with information and too long. Of course, every person is important and this is the historically most correct approach but if Nolan had focused more on one topic (for instance the trinity test or the hearings) the movie would have been even more stunning and more meaningful. In the first half of the movie, the viewer does not really become acquainted to the person Oppenheimer and his thoughts. The movie depicts all the stations in his life in an objective manner, without letting the viewer grasp many emotions (which is inevitable for a biopic in my opinion).The first hour of the movie might be a little bit overwhelming at first, because many characters are introduced and the different scenes might seem incoherent.However, the movie gathers momentum and becomes more and more thrilling.The last third of the movie is surely the most packing and stunning one. Here, the story is the most focused and narrated in an extraordinary and exciting way. All the threads are brought together, which is why it is definitely the strongest part of the movie.Of course, the ending is (as always in Nolan-movies) amazing and rounds up the film in an outstanding manner. It also encourages the viewer to think again, so that nobody is just standing up from their seat and leaving the cinema without thinking about what they just saw.In general, Nolan produced an amazing movie with a great cast, amazing music and an interesting story. However, his older movies such as The Dark Knight, Inception or Dunkirk are overall more rounded, focused and meaningful, which is why I have been a little bit disappointed. I expected Nolan to produce his best movie given the cast and the story with a lot of potential. In my opinion, Nolan did not exploit all the potential that Oppenheimer's story provides.However, Nolan created a thought-provoking movie that is definitely one of the best biopic/dramas of this decade.He succeeded his goal to challenge the viewer and make them think about the topic on their own. Even three days after watching the biopic, I cannot let go of thinking about the stunning story and its significant impact.Before watching Oppenheimer, one should know that just like Tenet, Oppenheimer is not a movie for the masses. Because of its long duration, long dialogue sequences and rather complex storytelling, many people will probably get off without even understanding what Nolan wanted to show them. If you really want to understand the movie and enjoy its story, you need to commit to it and focus on what Nolan is showing you. Otherwise, the movie might seem boring - because you did not get to the core of its story!07/10- Cinematography,
10/10 - Music & Sound,
10/10 - Cast performance,
08/10 - Story/Script,
09/10 - Directing,-> 09/10 overall."
"""Oppenheimer "", Christopher Nolan's 11th feature film, is a character study of the man behind the Manhattan project, J. Robert Oppenheimer. This film peers into his life, achievements, relationships and flaws with the backdrop of the race to make a functioning atomic bomb first before the Nazis and then before the Soviets. Although this film, on paper, could read much like a biopic, a more accurate genre for this film would be ""thriller"" edging on ""horror"". From the first sequence, the viewer is gripped by the momentum of the film and never given a chance to recover. The editing, acting, sound design and cinematography all work in unison to push the viewer along through this complex narrative and create a truly transfixing experience. Although the initial viewing was an impressive experience, the pace of the narrative and complexity of the cast and dialogue lended to an amount of confusion that was not negligible. Upon second viewing, it was much easier to follow the plot and characters, allowing me to have a different and even more immersive and emotional experience than the first viewing. This may be a problem for some viewers who do not wish to see the movie twice, but as many Nolan fans will understand, his style of movie making challenges the viewer, and this film is no different. Though I have only seen it twice, I strongly suspect this is a film that keeps giving with every additional viewing."
"'Oppenheimer', like the historical figure it places on center stage; is complex, cerebral, obsessed with its own brilliance, disjointed and awe inspiring.Like any great film, it shows mastery of film conventions, while challenging and pushing the boundaries. It is both entertaining and insightful. It provides moments of acting excellence through subtle drama (the quality of acting chops on display is of the highest order) and is flat out bombastic when appropriate.It is the culmination of the director's, Christopher Nolan, decades of experience, natural talent and commercial success. And yet, in my view it is not his best film ('The Prestige', just there is no ambiguity). For a simple reason, that there is no need to rewatch it (although I most certainly will).Unlike the best of Nolan's films, there is no effective twist, no real emotionally impactful moment of revelation, no need to piece together the subtle cues left like breadcrumbs that Nolan is such a master of.Instead this film demonstrates a deep understanding of the subject mater; quantum and atomic science, political nuance and trickery, the mechanics and embedded suspicion of the US security apparatus, and the pre and post-war political reality that the modern citizen is only vaguely aware of.For example, the portrayal of the Trinity test itself, did not use CGI but instead is the filming of a miniature petrol bomb layered over itself to give the effect of an atomic explosion. Which is itself a clever bit of filmmaking. But does little to add to the resonance of the moment (especially if you are unaware of the fact as I was when I watched the film). In fact, I would argue that given the many CGI atomic explosions filmgoers have seen over the years, it almost looks and feels strange in comparison.These types of meticulous demonstration of the film makers knowledge and expertise is surely something only a handful of moviegoers will genuinely care about. And at times even comes at the expense of clarity, character familiarity (there are a myriad of characters who only appear briefly despite being portrayed by big-ticket actors), pacing and scene transition. While at other times becomes the only thread that actually carries the momentum and convoluted plot.The length of the film is not entirely justified by the arch of the story and the structure feels unnecessarily unwieldy, I wasn't bored, but I did feel the third act did fall flat, as very little else was setup for the last key lines of dialogue of the film. As such while I truly enjoyed the film and relish that this subject matter had its moment in the radiated light of the modern cinema experience, it falls short of being a masterpiece for being more bloated than it needed to be."
"""Oppenheimer"" is an awe-inspiring masterpiece that exemplifies Christopher Nolan's unparalleled brilliance as a filmmaker. Rarely does a film possess such profoundness that it leaves me utterly speechless. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer is nothing short of extraordinary, capturing the complexities of the character with sheer brilliance. The entire ensemble cast delivers exceptional performances, elevating the film to greater heights.Nolan's directing prowess shines through every frame, weaving a gripping narrative that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The editing is seamless, effortlessly transitioning between timelines and character perspectives, adding layers of depth to the storytelling. Ludwig Goransson's haunting score complements the film's emotional depth, enhancing every scene with a perfect blend of intensity and poignancy. The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the essence of each era with stunning visual elegance.""Oppenheimer"" reaffirms Nolan's reputation as a visionary storyteller, masterfully blending history, science, and human drama into a profound cinematic experience. It is a thought-provoking exploration of the moral dilemmas surrounding scientific advancements and their far-reaching consequences.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" stands as one of Christopher Nolan's finest works, an exquisitely crafted symphony of storytelling that resonated deeply with me. It is a true testament to the power of cinema and a must-watch for anyone seeking an intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant cinematic journey."
"I've enjoyed watching Nolans work in cinemas for the full experience, so I was very excited going into Oppenheimer.While the movie was shot very well with some great performances, the movie itself is just lacking in a number of important areas that make for a good movie.The relationships in the movie all feel artificial, there isn't a lot to them, a lot of characters are introduced along the way and you are likely not fully understanding their importance, and they also don't feel important most of the time.It was interested seeing the build up to what lead to the race to make the bomb, but once you get into the middle of the movie, I hate to say it but it gets boring. This is a 3 hour movie that feels like a 3 hour movie. By the middle it really does feel like a movie where people are just casually talking for a long time.There are very few moments where you're hooked on a characters every word, because again, it doesn't feel important and neither do they for the most part. I can think back to suddenly being hooked at one moment coming out of the middle and that was Emily Blunt's performance as Kitty, while getting grilled, the way she handled it.The movie just needed more, it needed better pacing and it needed more to keep you hooked, it needed to establish relationships better between characters, they felt shallow.I also feel like the way Oppenheimer was presented didn't make me feel bad for him, he knew what he was getting into and only once it was all said and done he started to have little moments where he felt some kind of trauma? I'm not sure if that' what it was, he had visions but again, we didn't get a scene where he was just alone and showing emotion so I don't fully know.Historically it did a pretty good job on getting the facts in place, minus a few things left out.Overall, as a big fan of Nolan, I'd say this falls under a lot of his previous work."
"From a cinematic standpoint, Nolan's directorial skills are unmatched.My issue with the film comes from its highly sympathetic view of Oppenheimer. Nolan makes Oppenheimer into a martyr, which was the same thing that happened in the book this movie is based on. However, the man had heavy communist sympathies. They touch on his belief that the Americans should have been collaborating with the Soviets; however, that's as far as it goes in the movie. There is compelling evidence to suggest that he (or one of his proxies) was leaking secrets to the Soviets. When Truman arrived at Potsdam and told Stalin about the bomb, Stalin already knew about it, meaning this info would likely have come from high up in the chain of command. This movie displayed a sympathetic view of Oppenheimer when in fact he likely was giving info to the USSR.It is a shame now because we are currently seeing the fruits of the communist infiltration of the 50s and 60s manifesting in the country today. The subversion of America has taken multiple generations, and although Oppenheimer may have been unjustly harassed (I believe justly), the Americans of the 50s were right to be petrified by communist infiltration. If only we would heed their warnings now."
"A complicated story that is very interestingly told. Some of my fellow movie goers expressed that they didn't appreciate that the story is not told in a traditional timeline but that was something I really thought made the movie engaging. It creates the impetus to pay close attention to the flow and the opinions expressed by the participants at various points in time and how they evolved and iterated.The personal relationships were not the most interesting but certainly were an integral part of his character development. We will definitely be watching this again to enjoy the story, structure and evocative editing."
"Like most of the Nolan's movies, this movie is fast paced . The non-linear storytelling, the detailed character arcs, and the non-stop dialogues keep you invested, in what would otherwise have been a dull biopic. While the non-stop dialogues , back and forth, keeps you engrossed, it becomes tiring at times and leaves you wanting a break. Performance wise, Robert Downey Jr. Stands out. All other actors have done good job. Music is atmospheric and blends well with the scenes, except for a few instances where it gets too loud and annoying. Nolan should make more movies which are character-driven like Oppenheimer and The Prestige, instead of making soulless sci-fi garbage like Interstellar."
"The moral dilemma this movie places you in and the way Nolan took you through this journey in an unprecedented approach to documentaries leaving you in a trance like state for 3 hours.Cillian Murphy portrayal of Oppenheimer was spotless , He deserves an Oscar, his eyes conveyed every single emotion so vividly is was captivating !The whole cast performance was on point RDJ simply made me hate him as Strauss .I would have loved to see more of kitty and her deterioration into alcoholism.The cinematography and music score was quite extraordinary taking you through various emotions and the mind state of the characters.This is by far the best movie I have seen in 2023 on so many levels .. perfectly splendid !"

"Blown away - literally and metaphorically. This is a tour de force of a movie. The acting across the entire cast was tremendous but Murphy must be up for an Oscar. His portrayal was rich, meaningful and so engaging. The conflict was visible in every nuance and every twist. So many contradictions, so much duplicity and never a dull moment in the 3 hours of watching. The moment of detonation was such a powerful reset on the entire film, theory only gets you so far, now once practice started there was no turning back. A moral quagmire of a political witch hunt, humanity hurt and the American public infantilised. It was though breathless to witness."
"Being a WWII history buff, I was deeply moved watching this movie. Murphy's brilliant depiction is breath taking. Felt like he was able to show us emotions on his face for feeling which we just feel 'internally'. A gorgeous walk through the history and how we reached here.

"One word. Amazeballs!!!!That Explosion was ""THE"" Greatest and most Incredibly Crafted scene that I just was not ready about, I thought I was watching the greatest mime shortflim in flim history!!!Scintillating experience delivered once again by the duo Christopher N and Cillian M like what you know as words that could be used as phrased sentences in the form of praise would be considered insufficient in its true nature.That's a God damn master stroke or a bullet for 2 souls, kind of a deliverance for us, exceptionally for me who is still mind buckled at the kind of art display prowess Nolan has gifted us.I today can say that winning an Oscar is surely a great deal as a sign of an out of the ordinary performance.It has always been great pleasure to applaud Matt and the performance it offers as a great actor. RDJ Jr is always a well deserved recipient of my love for him firstly as a pure soul he is and Secondary my earnest wishes I have for him to excel in everything that he touches.Emily blunt was also awespiring as usual with her concrete performance as a supportive wing.Florence was also great in giving us access through those wormhole entries through Robert O's lifescale.I am pretty much done by words....but this has a special place in my mind, when ever Chris N movies are spoken about on this planet.👋 *"
"Oppenheimer (2023) :
Movie Review -Oppenheimer Review : Christopher Nolan, one of the greatest filmmakers in the World with the most consistent filmography, brings a new cinematic treat, ""Oppenheimer"". Based on the life of a physicist named ""J. Robert Oppenheimer,"" this one is easily the most human-driven story ever told by Nolan. There is less action, more drama; there is less complexity, more tension; there is less soul, more characteristics, there is less everything of known-Nolan, but finally we have conversions in a Nolan movie. Oppenheimer is anything but a trademark Nolan film. When you look at his filmography, you see these things: Following was a low-budget banger with a classic twist; Memento is pathbreaking storytelling; Insomania is his attempt at psychological tension; Batman Begins is a revolution in the Superhero genre; The Prestige is a magical thriller; The Dark Knight is an Intellectual face off between the hero and the villain; Inception is a next-level sci-fi thriller; The Dark Knight Rises is a fulfilling send-off to the greatest superhero trilogy ever; Interstellar is an expansion of sci-fi Epic beyond infinity; Dunkirk is the most human-friendly and technically brilliant war drama; and Tenet is a fine example of time-breaking theme meeting groundbreaking visuals. After serving us something of the Nolan-fied genre in his every movie, the man finally enters the human drama genre, and how? If you think that Oppenheimer will be talking about the invention of the atom bomb and will take you to a laboratory to see the practicals behind its making, then you are wrong. Apparently, I was thinking of the same stuff, but I was wrong. The film is all about its title - Oppenheimer. It's the journey of a man who was excited to create a power that would make his country survive, but soon he realises that it is making some people lose their lives. The excitement, the trauma, the shivering, the lifelong guilt everything is there. There is blood on his hands, and he can't wash it. It's a textbook on Oppenheimer's life, but in a 3-hour brief. One thing is sure, after watching this film, you'll never forgive the name of J. Robert Oppenheimer, not because he achieved something in his life but because of what he lost.As we know, Nolan does not believe in simple linear equations, so he has a non-linear narration again. One of them runs in black and white, indicating that the world is colourless after the fruit has spread its fire all over the world, not just Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Lieutenant General Leslie Richard Groves (Matt Damon) trusts J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) to create a miracle for the American Government. Robert is appointed director of the project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons programme. Robert and the team achieve success at the Trinity test, and the president soon sends the bombs to be dropped on Japanese soil. Robert's celebration soon turns into a trauma, and he realises that the world might never be the same. He is framed for being a Soviet Spy, and the legal fight is not in his favour. How the most important man in the world at that time is trapped against the odds and how his acquaintances turn their backs on him is all that you get to see in the latter half.A three-hour runtime frightens me for sure, but not when the director is Nolan or Cameron. A three-hour movie does not feel boring, if it's Avatar 2 or Oppenheimer. The screenplay is on the job there, and it makes every minute worth it. Oppenheimer is pretty slow in the beginning as the characters are new and a lot of Robert's personnel are discussed on the screen. So he was a womaniser, a communist, and not a brilliant man, but do we have to see it all? And for so long? Oppenheimer loses the character's grip there. Robert's complicated illicit affair with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) is too detailed and bare. I know a lot of Indians are curious to know whether that Bhagwadgita phrase is used in the film or not, so let me tell you, yes, it is used, and twice. The first use of ""I am become death, the destroyer of the world"" might offend some religious people here. It might even become a big controversy in our country today. In those old times, when they told us the biopics of legendary inventors with ""The Story of Louis Pasteur"" (1936), ""Edison The Man"" (1940), ""Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet"" (1940), ""Madam Curie"" (1942), and a few others, they never showed the protagonist in a bad light. But that era is gone, and today we have to deal with several intimate facts that need to be shown in the film, so it's okay. The slow start does an effective trick to let us know the characters, but even 3 hours feels too short for them to fit well.Cillian Murphy is flawless as J. Robert Oppenheimer from start to end. You might have seen him in many good roles and solid performances, but this one surpasses them all. The tension, the fear, the excitement, the enthusiasm, the pressure, the guilt, and many more things, but this man carried full loads on his shoulder. Out of 3 hours, this guy hooks you to the screen for about 2 and a half hours, while all the others get half an hour of their own. It was such a big responsibility, and he did a great job. It's not just about facial expressions and dialogue delivery; Murphy had to look like Oppenheimer. For people who haven't seen Robert Oppenheimer in real life, Cillian Murphy is Robert Oppenheimer. Emily Blunt's shovelling testimony will win your heart, but there is nothing much to do for her there. He is there for 20 minutes, or maybe 30, but the way Robert Downey Jr. Has brought Lewis Strauss to the screen is simply amazing. Matt Damon's general is rough and tough, Josh Harnett's Lawrence is noticeable, Kenneth Branagh and Casey Affleck are fine, Rami Malek's cameo will have you clapping, and Tom Conti's Einstein is impeccable. Florence Pugh looks solid and drippy (as the character demands), while the big supporting cast of Benny Safdie, Dylan Arnold, Matthew Modine, Michael Angarano, Jack Quaid, Josh Peck, Olivia Thirlby, David Krumholtz, Dane DeHaan, David Dastmalchian, and others have been extremely encouraging.Oppenheimer is technically a powerful film, but not as great as some of Nolan's previous works. The background score will have your heart pumping Faster on many occasions, and that disturbing score with lapses will have your throat choked. Watch out for the Trinity test sequences and Oppenheimer's testimony scene, and I am 100% sure you are gonna be blown away by the impact of the BGM. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is very fine, especially the nuke scene. Nolan usually believes in practical effects and 2D viewing, and he also made this film without any CGI segments. Oppenheimer does not have anything groundbreaking as such, but the realistic effects do work on the IMAX screen. For instance, the bomb explosion scene. You expect it to be loud from the start, but you get a low sound and literally silence there. It makes practical sense, as we know sound takes time to travel, and by the time it reaches you, you are completely unaware of its existence. That's a masterstroke. A technical brilliance that everyone should notice. Christopher Nolan's storytelling goes through a change here. As mentioned above, Oppenheimer has nothing stone-breaking to offer, and frankly, it gets confusing sometimes with the new characters talking about something terribly new that you aren't aware of, but it's such a pleasure to see Nolan trying a simple human story with his extraordinary vision, of course. Robert's speech scene after the successful bomb test is artistically wonderful. The man has to speak about celebration and all happy things, and he does that, but his inner world is destroyed in those moments. How to describe two different emotions, happiness and sadness, at the same time is what you learn from Master Nolan here. See that framework, man. Oppenheimer is about Nolan attempting a complete character study, and for this reason, it is a must-see. The feel of the docudrama takes away the mass appeal of the film, but did Nolan ever care about that chunk of audiences? No. He didn't. He has his own audience, which is smart enough to understand his cinema. That's what you get here. Nolan's latest cinematic bomb blasts on the screen and leaves you burning off screen with its traumatic consequences. One bomb blasts there on the big screen, and the other one blasts outside the screen-that's inside you.RATING - 7/10*"

"A lot of people call this immediately future classic, masterpiece, lucky to witness it and so much more.For me - Oppenheimer movie is still good, very good, probably one of the best I could watch in past year. But it still missed a little (and maybe in some things even more than a little) to be called such names.Biggest problem was probably storyline and pace. I have to admit, if I wasn't such science and physics geek I would rate this movie even lower. For me, there wasn't any moment that would grab me - only plot twist there was could be seen from row on popcorn before movie even start. Music was, eh, there was a music? Maybe I'm too spoiled from previous scores, but this wasn't something I would wrote home about. And after first few opening scenes that were visualy amazing, there wasn't any more visualy moments that I would floor me - again I was used to see in Nolan movies. Also lot of characters were little bit shallow, lot of the motives and actions were let on viewer to imagine them and fill the gaps.On the positive note, the inner struggle of main protagononist was done extremely well and sometime you could almost grasp what it could be to live in this moment and as this person - with all it's positive and negative effects."
"Is this the best movie ever made? Probably not. However, if this is not what the 10 button is used for, I don't know what is. It's a masterpiece. A love for cinema wrapped in a complex drama with acting that is superb throughout. From a technical aspect alone - cinematography, casting, acting, etc. - this deserves every star. Add in the complex flutter of emotions, the tact that Nolan applies throughout the entire story, and the layers of meaning that discuss a whole host of human endeavors and moral scruples, this move becomes what movies are all about. Hollywood should take note - we love THESE movies. Fund THESE movies."
"Had fun watching the movie. It was worth the 3 hours time especially in the cinema. The storytelling skills of Christopher Nolan are incomparable and really you can see them through the movie. At first you get confused why you don't understand, what that happens and that and then the story keep slowly unfolding while also building tension with the viewer as well. Unfortunately, I didn't get to see the movie in imax cinema, because we don't have true Imax in Germany, but nonetheless, it was very enjoyable experience and was worth every minute. I would definitely recommend watching the movie if you haven't already."
"This is the best movie of I've ever seen. Beautiful score, superb performances, a masterful piece of cinematic art. I was worried about a three hour movie but not a second was wasted. There was nothing self-indulgent and nothing over-wrought. There were blessedly no modern political lessons. It was historically portrayed. OMG Emily Blunt had me wanting to jump from my seat in awe and admiration of her character. RDJ was brilliant and the evolution of his character something amazing to witness. We see the naïveté of brilliant scientists, the depravity of politicians, the heart wrenching reality of not being able to put the atomic bomb genie back in the bottle. Do not miss seeing this movie in the theater. Find the biggest screen with the best sound system. It's worth it."
"This feels like the culmination of Nolan's life's work.Simply put: it's a masterpiece.The pace of the film is perfect, there's never a dull or slow moment.The soundtrack from Goransson is perfect and does not distract from the narrative but elevates it, the music is constant throughout the film which intensifies the silence of the bomb.The cinematography is a masterclass from Hoyte Van Hoytema.Robert Downey Jr gives a career-best performance, Cillian Murphy deserves the Oscar for best actor, Emily Blunt is striking and powerful, Florence Pugh is perfect and the entire supporting cast nailed their roles.I have only ever rated 2 films 10/10. This is one of them."
"Christopher Nolan has done it again! ""Oppenheimer"" is a breathtaking cinematic masterpiece that takes audiences on a mind-bending journey through one of history's most pivotal moments. With his signature storytelling prowess and impeccable attention to detail, Nolan crafts a gripping narrative that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant.The film centers around the life and work of J.

"This movie was amazing with the cinematography, the acting , and the music was phenomenal, I just think the movie was a little too long and could have been made maybe 20 minutes shorter and the movie was kind of confusing , I didn't understand a lot of it and I had to ask my friend to explain, but it had some of the best cinematography and music I've ever seen , definitely the best sounds and music I've seen in a movie , Cillian murphys acting was amazing as well as Matt Damon and Robert Downey junior . The movie did not disappoint it exceeded all expectations, even though it was 3 hours , I wasn't bored for any it. It hooks you in with the sudden tone changes . I think the movie needs a rewatch to understand the movie better . I'll leave the rating at a 9 but it could become better or worse with rewatch ."
"The film is packed with emotions, one of the best dialogues, the storyline, the acting special mention Cilian Murphy, the direction, the cinematography everything every bit of it is an art and Christopher Nolan is the artist. Hats off to the VFX and CGI team for there work. You don't get attached to the screen immediately but you will eventually. The film takes its time which is most beautiful aspect of it and when the work is done it shows the excellence of the director the on the screen. Somehow every person in the hall stays focused and enjoys the film. For me it was avlast experience do tell yours."
"The hype is greater than what's delivered. This movie does have good acting but nothing to rave about, my opinion. Instead of developing the story the constant back and forth from the present to the past and future was extremely annoying. No pictures of the the aftermath in Japan was an a front to history as well as ignoring all the homesteaders that were displaced and the native Americans kicked of their land. I guess the pandemic lowered the bar for what's acceptable for viewers and ratings are super bloated. Save your money and bladder and wait until it shows up on your favorite streaming channels. Disappointed."
"I was pretty eager to see this film, despite its 3 hour length, and just went today to see it. For about half of it, I have to say, I was so bored. The acting was amazing don't get me wrong, and the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki have always been interesting subjects to me, but this was just boring..It moved kinda slow at first for me and I found myself daydreaming to stop myself from falling asleep. I know that it's long, and I get why it's long: I'd rather sit through 3 hours of one film than 1 hour 30 mins of one and have to wait 3 years for a sequel. I get it. But I am a person who doesn't really like science, it's my least favourite school subject and I'm not very good at it, especially physics. So I was so uninterested in all of the science-y talk and equations or whatever Oppenheimer was doing. It made the film feel a lot longer. Again, I get that we have to understand how he made the bombs or whatever but I felt like I was watching a step-by-step tutorial on how to make one instead.I didn't feel any emotion really throughout the film (except from the sexual scenes because I was with my parents so I was embarrassed) and I was even about to check the time at some points, which is something I don't really do during films.I do have some positive notes though: the acting was really good, as expected from people like Cillian Murphy and Rami Malek. The music was also good too, even if it was just quietly playing in the background. I also like how we see how making the bomb later affected Oppenheimer; like him saying that he felt like he had blood on his hands, and him seeing bright lights (representing the atomic bomb) twice. I thought that was cool too.So while I do think it was kinda boring and didn't fully live up to my expectations, I can also tell that a lot of effort was put into it. There were a lot of good actors here too like Robert Downey Jr, Cillian Murphy and Rami Malek (who I was really happy to see lol). If you're into movies about true events (so historic movies) then I'd say definitely go and see it. If you can't handle the 3 hours though, or you think you'd get bored, maybe don't bother with this then. However, would I watch this again? Probably not. But it's not a bad movie at all."
"If you are not familiar with Robert Oppenheimer's life Id recommend quickly scrolling through his Wikipedia page before seeing this movie. Although Christopher Nolan does an excellent job at introducing the characters, it are still a lot of names to remember. The star stacked cast makes it difficult to determine which names you should absolutely remember and which are less important.Still, it is impressive how Nolan was able to fit Oppenheimer's life in just 3 hours without rushing anything or brushing over certain topics. The camerawork, like in his other films, is incredible and the story was intrigueing while conveying a message about the danger of atomic weapons.The acting is sublime, as you would expect for this cast, with Cillian Murphy performing an oscar-worthy performance. I would gladly watch an additional 3 hours with Cillian as Oppenheimer."
"Oppenheimer is without a doubt one of the greatest films released in the past decade. Christopher Nolan has once again created a masterpiece in terms of production quality, cinematography, sound, and of course...the writing. Oppenheimers story is powerful and very complex as he works in the second World War to build a bomb that will hopefully end the war, but as all things do, problems arise for our protagonists. One of the things this film did exceptionally well, was portray Oppenheimer as he was, no bars held. As you may have guessed, he is not a good person, and the film did not stray away from revealing that. It showed he had good intentions but in the end wasn't the best. The sound design team deserves an Oscar themselves for how outstanding they did. The theater shook and rumbled all around us as the classic marching sound swelled and filled the theater, and the sounds the bomb made and his visions made were so good. The movie also successfully filled all 3 hours worth with story, and kept me immersed the entire time. As for the cons, which is only one, the movie is truly and mostly just men talking in a room for 3 hours. Overall, if you want a deep, powerful movie with excellent acting and production design, you should absolutely check this film out."
"Oppenheimer is an incredible film. It was like watching an adapted Thomas Pynchon novel mixed with lectures by favorite physics professors augmented by the inward struggle of secondary characters poised with difficult intrapersonal decisions (except the events in the film actually happened in real life).I sincerely hope Oppenheimer sweeps the Oscars/Academy Awards because everyone involved in the production deserves it. Oppenheimer contains phenomenal performances, remarkable dialogue, flawless writing and production.From a strictly objective point of view, it is Nolan's best film.Rating: 10/10."
"A very well executed historical piece. It seems like every part worked: the writing, pacing, soundtrack, acting, visuals, everything. It's a very dense 3 hour movie that stays true to the history and source material. While you can probably enjoy the movie without knowing much history of the subject, it's very rewarding if you learn some background on the Manhattan Project, Los Alamos, Oppenheimer, and Strauss as there isn't much handholding done by Nolan.The tension building was excellent and the pacing was great, considering it made an hour of government bueracracy actually engaging.The practical effects used worked well to give us insight into Oppenheimer's brewing internal conflict and sense of regret. And all the actors present their roles well, seeing as all of those people were complex historical characters.Lastly Matt Damon brings his own charm to his portrayal of Groves and does not disappoint.This is definitely one of the best movies I've seen and is a must watch for scientists, engineers, and world war 2 history enthusiasts."
"When I watched Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, I never thought I would discover I had much in common with the ""father of the atomic bomb"" (apart from the fact that we had both studied at Cambridge). Our admiration T. S. Eliot and John Donne. As soon as I got home, I opened my poetry books and reread the lines mentioned in the movie, trying to understand how Oppenheimer was inspired by them. They all had a common theme: destruction & rebirth
Let's take a look at Eliot's poem, Waste Land, which was published in 1921April is the cruelest month, breeding
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
Memory and desireApril, which is the symbol of awakening and rebirth, is cruel because when the birds begin to sing and the fields begin to bloom, our narrator feels the darkness, death wish and fear more intensely. While he tells about death, destruction caused by war, loss of faith and hope, loneliness and barrenness with references to Dante, Shakespeare and mythological texts, he also gives signs of rebirth by making references to rain and the rooster that heralds the morning:Only a cock stood on the rooftree.Co co rico co co rico.In a flash of lightning.Then a damp gust.Bringing rain.Oppenheimer collects the particles of reality he finds in the middle of the wasteland and seeks ways to reassemble them differently, Maybe he was after a new and different state of being, like Eliot, like the cubist painter Picasso he admired.Another poet who inspired him during the design and implementation of the Manhattan Project is John Donne. When General Leslie Grovers asks where the name ""Trinity"" comes from, Oppenhaimer replies in a letter to him: ""There is a poem I love that John Donne wrote just before his death: Hymn to God, My God, in My Sickness. Invocation of My God)."" This poem describes a man who is not afraid of death because he believes in rebirth... There is another poem: Batter my heart, three-person'd God'...""Then he tells that Trinity got its name from this poem of John Donne's best known and most discussed. Trinity in Christian theology, the name given to the divine trinity consisting of the . In this poem quoted by Oppenheimer, the narrator begs the three-person'd God (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) to blow, bend, break him. Only if he is chained, he truly will be free, if he is burned and destroyed, he will be reborn.Based on the assumption that rebirth is not possible without disintegration, destruction, burning, and extinction. And inspired by poets and painters, he ""dares to disturb the universe"","
"Both Christopher Nolan's directing and Cillian Murphy's acting as well as the supporting cast acting are just spot on. Not a single moment during the movie, you will feel like you're watching a play, the performance delivered by the cast is the amazing foundation that will keep you entertained through the whole 3 hours of this film, many scenes of which are just pure politics talking.Every part of this movie starting with the script and ending with the cinematography screams that this movie will become an all-time classic and inspire other directors and actors to push themselves to the levels the team of Oppenheimer did. Although the movie lacked some epicness and much-needed tension in its parts for my taste, it is well compensated by rare but truly breathtaking moments. After the final scene is done and the credits start rolling in, you'll be glued to your seat for a minute or two, comprehending what you've just witnessed, not able to stand up.From unbelievable soundtrack and sound design to breathtaking graphics and film quality, this movie is not meant to be seen not in IMAX. The bass that shakes your seat so hard you feel like Trinity is going off somewhere near the theater, the amazing detail on screen that truly make you feel 100% immersed in the moment, this feels like an industry standard to come."
"Oppenheimer, the latest masterpiece from maestro Christopher Nolan, we are treated to a breathtakingly orchestrated symphony of performances. Cillian Murphy and the rest of the cast harmonize superbly, embodying their roles with a precision that only enhances Nolan's sharp direction.There is, however, a lingering thought that Robert Downey Jr.'s talents are somewhat underutilized in the role of the antagonist. Downey Jr., known for his charisma and witty charm, could have brought additional layers to his character, thus leaving a sense of missed opportunities.Yet the standout anomaly in casting is undeniably Josh Peck. Notorious for lighter, comedic roles, his inclusion in this highly intense and emotionally charged narrative feels a tad out of sync. Despite his earnest efforts, Peck's performance seems to lack the emotional gravitas necessary for such a plot, causing an ever so slight hiccup in an otherwise seamlessly executed film. This minor flaw, while easy to overlook, becomes increasingly hard to ignore once noticed, putting a small dent in an otherwise brilliantly crafted cinematic experience."
"Wow! What a great movie! At the beginning, I was a little confused, but I loved how everything comes together, and you get to know what Oppenheimer is all about. It's not just about the bomb or the man who created it, but also about the process of how life can bring down even the smartest among us. I appreciated the way he realized that there is a huge difference between how he wanted them to use the bomb and how they actually did.Christopher Nolan did it again with a masterpiece. I love these kinds of movies, and my love for them will just never end. The acting, the visuals, the way Nolan represents his vision, it's all marvelous. Just marvelous! I love this movie."
How can a movie about the apocalypse be so long? At 3 hours this thing is a nightmare. It could easily be 90 minutes. The 1989 John Cusack film fat man and little boy covers the same material but is infinitely more entertaining.So let's see. Oppenheimer is asked to make the atomic bomb. And he spends an inordinate amount of time wondering if maybe the bomb is bad or Communists are bad or whether he should sleep with another woman. And Iron Man pops up and decides he doesn't like Oppenheimer so he tells everyone that Oppenheimer is bad. And in the end everybody gets fired. Seriously why did this have to take 3 hours?The cinematography was nice all of the technical stuff was nice. And half of Hollywood seems to be in the movie. I guess after covid everybody's dying for work any work. But honestly I would suggest that you just look up fat man and little boy and watch that instead.Yawn. How did they make a movie that made me almost want to fall asleep while they're setting off an atomic bomb? That's what I'd like to know.
"I am not really sure how many stars I should give to this movie. As everyone else I was also waiting for a new Nolan movie and the Manhattan project is an interesting topic too. I was tired when I went to the cinema but normally that's not a problem. I still see the film too. This time I fell asleep and I only woke up for the last 20 Minutes. It looked pretentious and boring too, Murphy was never my favourite actor and this film didn't help either, what I saw.I also realised why I don't normally like Nolan's works apart from Inception. The editing is not artistic, not the greatest cinema,just annoying simply.I might watch the whole movie at some point but probably not, unless I have trouble falling asleep."
"Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer' is a masterpiece that seamlessly weaves together historical events, scientific discoveries, and the complexities of human emotions. The film's ability to engage and immerse the audience is truly remarkable. The performances by Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt are nothing short of extraordinary, leaving viewers with a deep connection to their characters and a profound sense of empathy and admiration.Nolan's signature visual style is on full display in 'Oppenheimer,' captivating audiences with breathtaking cinematography and awe-inspiring set pieces. The film's narrative is enthralling, keeping viewers at the edge of their seats throughout the entire runtime. As a storyteller, Nolan once again proves his brilliance, delivering a gripping and thought-provoking cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll.The blending of historical accuracy with a compelling fictional narrative showcases Nolan's dedication to crafting a film that both educates and entertains. 'Oppenheimer' serves as a testament to the power of cinema to illuminate significant moments in history while provoking reflection on the human condition and the consequences of scientific advancement.In conclusion, 'Oppenheimer' is a tour de force that deserves praise not only for its technical brilliance but also for its profound impact on the audience. Nolan's ability to transcend traditional boundaries of storytelling makes this film an unforgettable cinematic journey, solidifying his place as one of the most influential filmmakers of our time. 🎥✨ #Oppenheimer."
"This movie has exceeded my expectations by far, with some significant/reoccurring elements in the film that enhances the possibility of a war, zero cgi used in the film and it was still extremely beautiful which that deserves alot of credit, and how well the non linear structure was used to help explain Oppenheimer's story. The acting in the film was really great aswell with a great performance from Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. I would highly recommend this movie, although try to watch it in the best format possible with dolby atmosphere it will greatly enhance you're experience for the film, in my opinion Oppenheimer is definitely #2 on my favorite movies list as of now."
"Oppenheimer is a meticulously crafted, narrative-driven film that evokes unanswerable moral questions while framing historical events from multiple perspectives - each with its own clashing interests.With its veteran filmmaker at the helm, ensemble talent, daunting soundtrack, and peak cinematography, Oppenheimer manages to not only reach but surpass the highest echelons of the contemporary movie landscape.The captivating tension and pacing of the Trinity sequence coupled with the inherent grandeur of IMAX theaters culminate in an unforgettable experience that I've been fortunate enough to bear witness to.While one could argue the nudity gratuitous and the horses a superfluous highbrow cliché, these minor qualms do not even come close to taking anything away from the cinema mastery displayed in Christopher Nolan's latest entry.Last but not least, Cillian Murphy's emotional, credible, and multi-faceted portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer perfectly ties the whole package together."
Film is really good! Recommend it highly but for me the quantum physics stuff was too smart didn't understand some parts. And it was too long for me some scenes stretched out for too long.Apart from that the movie is one of my favourite true stories. The bomb explosion was amazing 10/10 visually and audibly it was fantastic. Of Course way better in cinema with the loud bomb which immerses you even deeper.The acting from Cillian Murphy is Oscar worthy. The whole casting was done perfectly. Loved RDJ being a part of this film shows how good of an actor he is. And also was nice seeing Einstein in the film.Definitely a must watch!
"It is my first time watching a biography. I dont usually like to watch such a full of dialogs on a movie, but this was different. I know Nolan's movies like The Dark Knight, Interstellar etc is outstanding, but i dont really expect anything for this movie (Because its not made actually for my taste). Nolan actually did a great job since this is a 3 Hours long movie about Father of the atomic bomb. I really like the transition between Oppenheimer POV and the Strauss one. The plot here is very acceptable and interesting from the beginning. I thought it would be a boring movie because of the dialogs, but it's not. The visualization for the atomic bomb itself is such a tremendous thing. Cillian Murphy has done it again here."
"Oppenheimer is without a doubt Christopher Nolan's best work ever. Robert Downey Jr.'s performance is exceptional and most probably his best work too. The movie is an emotional roller coaster, more political than scientific, and full of great senses (The Nolan Things).The movie should easily win five Oscars. Nolan for best achievement in directing, Robert Downey Jr. Best actor in supporting role, and best achievement in editing. Will mostly be nominated for best picture.9/10, I would have loved to see more of J. Robert Oppenheimer's story outside of the atomic bomb and more on the impact of using it on the world not taking advantage of the technology."
"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a cinematic tour de force that left me spellbound, evoking a mixture of thrill and horror as I witnessed the harrowing test of the atomic bomb on screen not once, but twice! This film is an unparalleled masterpiece that delves into the human psyche and the moral complexities of scientific progress, leaving an indelible mark on its audience. Seeing Oppenheimer twice allowed me to appreciate the depth and subtlety of Nolan's storytelling even more. The intricacies of the characters and their relationships become more apparent with each viewing, adding layers of nuance to an already captivating narrative. This film's ability to resonate on multiple levels is a testament to its brilliance and rewatchability."
"A classic Nolan film! The biggest aspect is the visuals that were made with no cgi, a true masterpiece and the acting was simply impeccable, Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Made it much more epic, the sound quality recieved so much hype that, I expected a lot but was disappointed (since, I expected a lot). A history repeated film, all the aspects i.e. Acting, visuals, sound and a special mention to the music team, I never got a single chance to believe, whether or not there was a cgi involved, it was a true visual, I suggest you to watch it twice or thrice if you are not a history and a science brat! But a true masterpiece and a must watch!!!"
"I wanted to like this movie; I like to think I'm a smart person with a decent attention span and interest in historical films. I just couldn't. Expected a movie about the inner conflicts and regrets of J. Robert Oppenheimer, and his arc of going from developing the bomb to advocating arms control. Some of it was there, it was just overshadowed with all the flashing back and forward and back again. This happened so many times I couldn't keep track of the names of people in Oppenheimer's personal circle as they were dropped. I didn't figure out who the hell Chevalier was until the very end, when I was supposed to be shocked by the twist that Strauss was behind the farcical security clearance hearing all along.I'm not going to come right out and say I just wanted to see the bomb exploding in all it's terrifying, horrific splendor...but maybe that's what I did want; the movie is called ""Oppenheimer"" so I wanted to feel the enormity of what he felt he'd done and be shocked by it. Nolan treated the subsequent communist witch-hunt and the government's/Strauss's turning against him as the ""thriller"" plotline (I almost couldn't take the music building up to some kind of climax as they were sitting there questioning Oppenheimer, as if to make up for the complete lack of excitement), at the expense of focusing on his inner conflict, the gap between theory and reality, and the wrestling with responsibility. It's not that the later turnabout doesn't fit into the story; it seemed like Nolan couldn't decide which aspect to focus on so he chose to do two or three at once. Maybe Chris Nolan thought it would be too obvious to tell it like that. Wasn't doing me any favors.Things I liked:
Kenneth Branagh as Niels Bohr.The two or three scenes where his family life and actions are shown to have an impact on Kitty; the scene where she couldn't take the baby crying anymore screwed me up almost more than anything in the film. I hated it, but I knew that feeling and I wanted to see how all this stuff was affecting her and their relationships as a family. Overall the family was a side act and the kids were only ever shown crying with Kitty being So Done, but it's never explored beyond that.The cheering scene after the bombing that turns to horror.The final revelation that Einstein and Oppenheimer weren't even talking about Strauss in that one scene. Almost ironic given how much of the movie is dedicated to Strauss.Seeing Robert Downey Jr. Play a character other than Iron Man.The theory vs. Reality conflict. I wish this had been developed more. It's emphasized that Oppenheimer is a theory man, so when it comes to the stark reality of what happens when theory gets turned into a bomb, I wanted to see him wrestle with that more. He's working on applying clean, academic theoretical physics to a weapon of mass destruction.I keep reading that Chris Nolan wants this movie to wake up AI developers to the potential dangers of creating something too powerful and potentially destructive. I couldn't find that in this movie. What I saw was more like a warning that no matter what you do, public and political opinion will always be fickle and you can never escape your past. You regret creating a weapon that destroys hundreds of thousands of innocents? Suck it up, it helped win the war. You helped America develop the bomb that ended the war? Too bad, you associated with communists/humiliated a senator at some point and now you're getting canceled. It came out as more of a cynical critique of political manipulation than a cautionary tale of wielding too much power. I suppose he was trying to show that the bomb wasn't the only thing Oppenheimer struggled with, but he couldn't find a way to do that without utterly confusing the storyline."
"The cover of the movie -- charismatic protagonist surrounded by atomic bomb effects -- looks intriguing and powerful enough to attract a wide range of audience from fans of Nolan to people who are interested in finding out about Oppenheimer and his biography.However, the majority of elements the movie provides are sadly yawn-inducing dialogues, constant time skips, and a huge chunk of political and nudity when it had so much potential to show off the invention of atomic bomb in details within 3 hours, especially the talented cast they had.The Nolan movies tend to start slow and take off dramatically with an amazing sound and cinematic scenes at the climax, but that was overshadowed by rushed exposition and unclear character developments along with a number of scenes thrown in a complete shambles.I do not recommend this movie to audiences who do not have patience to listen to fast-paced dialogue because if you don't enjoy such a type of movie, your expectation will not be met even at the climax."
"This film runs for a total of 3 hours and is at full throttle from the first minute. Christopher Nolan proves with this movie he is one of the greatest directors of all time. The reason I say that is because this movie is the most non traditional ""Nolan"" movie to date. That doesnt mean its lacking Massive and Beautiful story telling. (Let alone Cillian Murphy's 12/10 performance) The movie is a masterpiece. At times it didnt land with me, and thats ok. I think that is the point. You are not supposed to like it, and that is what makes it real. Without a major plot twist/mind bend per Nolan standard. This movie has left me thinking more than any previous entry in his Catalogue. I am here for every bit of it."
What a blast of a movie! The choice of actors and characters was staggeringly brilliant. The whole plot and the presentation was almost perfect. The confusing part for me was how the bomb test did not reveal any ripple effects days after for people that were clearly at the site of the test and yet 31 days later the Japanese had long standing side effects. The theater and the music was beautiful.Christopher Nolan did a good job. Robert Downy JR was my favorite and yes I am also generally a big fan of Rami Malek. Overall it's one of those rare movies I give a ten out of ten for the acting and the picture.
"It's hard to explain why this movie is so great, it gave me a never forgettable cinematic experience.The story revolves around Dr.j Robert Oppenheimer , mainly about the executive of the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and later the consequences Oppenheimer faced due to his invention!The background music is perfectly fit and out of this world experience, so engaging and top notch.And we talk about actors, Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr did an extraordinary ucomparable acting!You will definitely get the best of your hard earned money spent on this for sure.Christopher Nolan is back with a bang!!!"
"The first thing I want to say is that my Mind had to chew on this movie before this review came to me. I'm not going to lie as someone into Biopics this movie initially struck me as....familiar. It seemed well made but similar to a movie like the current wars or the imitation games. However after thinking of this movie for 24 hours my opinion has rapidly changed.This movie does not have overly complicated tones. In fact they are quite easy to understand. However, how does one truly understand the decision these men and women were grappling with. The decision to unleash this weapon with little uncertainty to the out come. The true understanding from the participants involved of the true monster they were unleashing.Not to give anything away but this a a movie that seems like an amazing biopic at first but transforms into a though invoking intense movie. The themes portrayed take time to process and digest to truly understand and is layered in ways few movies have been able to do.I highly recommend this movie as it is not only an entertaining and exciting adventure but also is something that will stay on your mind well after the credits roll."
"I watched the movie and I had a great discussions in the queue to the WC with other people after.The transition between the conviction/post-conference in mono-colour filming and the pre-scenes (I coin the term as the time before Hiroshima-Nagasaki event) coloured filming is slightly confusing, but you can compare what ""happened"" and what was framed at the conviction in your own way. I recommend watching the trailer or have a glance at the background, otherwise the beginning is also a bit perplexing.One of the questions the movie brought was about explanation of Hiroshima-Nagasaki event, why it needed to happen. Who should take the responsibility the most, the one who invented the atomic bomb, who ordered the bombing, or the bombed as what it deserves? Normally in many educations, the incident is described as the means to end the world wars, but, in the movie, it could be seen that Japan was chosen because there was nowhere else to throw the bombs on. In a way, the two cities in Japan were the perfect locations to experiment the impact of the bombs.The movie also nicely show the mental transition of Oppenheimer himself. From the excitement of materialising his own theories, the confidence to be the most admired man in the US and to the devastating emotion and guilt, possibly being the killer of thousands of people,Cillian Murphy and others played it so well."
"I was privileged enough to watch this film in 70mm IMAX in Nashville today. I drove about 3 hours each way, and it was absolutely worth the experience. I won't reveal any details about the movie, but I had a visceral, physiological reaction at multiple points during this film. My stomach was in knots, I began to feel very hot to the point that I was sweating. My arms tingled, similarly to the way they do when I am under a lot of pressure. It almost felt as though I was going to break out in hives. I cannot exactly claim that this experience was pleasant, but my body's reaction to this film experience was overwhelming. I could not help but to cry. This movie was incredibly moving in a way that I had never experienced before in a movie theatre. This film is very special."
"The quality of the movie is just as expected from christopher nolan. Extremely well structured and top class.Everything is great about the movie, the acting is top notch. Sound design is just out of this world. The theatre was shaking from the sound design. I have a feeling that nolan specifically chooses these frequencies of sounds which will cause the most vibrational effect and physical shake. The explosions felt like a friggin earthquake or blast wave was about to hit me and i was actually experiencing a real bomb.That was the best part of it in the cinema. But there are no spectacular visuals in this movie. I was expecting to see a scene with the dropping of the atom bomb or some war scenes at the very least. But none of that is there.Its a very intelectual movie mostly filled with talking and drama. Dont miss it! But there is no need to go to the cinemas. Watch it from home."
"This is by far one of Christopher Nolan's masterpieces after Interstellar which is my 10/10. Writing, Dialogue, Cinematography, Symbolism everything is just excellent, the standard of Nolan's films tho. And the performance is perfect for sure we've got a bunch of great actors so no doubt about the acting. Now talk about the plot. This film portrays an atomic bomb that destroys Nagasaki and Hiroshima, we all know about the story of it and how terrifying and dreadful it is then Nolan decided to present things that most people didn't know or were interested in, he decided to portray the insight of the inside story about a man who creates a nuclear bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer. And it is outcome intellectual. My favorite scene wouldn't be any scene but the bomb testing scene, it's so spectacular and made my jaw drop. However, I think this film isn't so complex compares to other Nolan films but that's not my complaint at all. In the end, I kind of enjoyed this movie and I think it adheres to Nolan's implementation and determination of his work."
"As a fan of Nolan's films, it is really hard to criticize his work because so many of his previous works are honestly quite amazing.So here we go...The first thing is that the acting in Oppenheimer is great, and Cillian, Robert, and the cast deserve all the best. They all carried this story on their shoulders and it is the main highlight of it.Secondly, the sound was also great. Amazing job of creating a mood and vibe for many sequences in the movie.BUT.Unfortunately, the storytelling of this movie suffers from the same symptoms of Tenet: it misses so many opportunities to make a real impact on the viewers. It feels disconnected.Overall the movie felt like a sequence of fast segments with little continuity that makes it hard to focus on the important parts, and it is also hard to deeply connect with the emotions of the characters or the intensity of the moment.If everything is intense, then there are no high stakes, and the overall feeling is well, tiresome.I thought initially that the lack of CGI sounded like a great idea, but it turned out to be not a great choice. There is a big moment in this movie that felt very small because it was obvious that they were using practical effects, and they weren't able to represent the proper scale of it.There are also so many moments in this film that could have benefited from visuals, and instead, there was just dialogue and more dialogue.There was a lot of hype about watching this movie on Imax and in big theaters.But what's the point of creating hype around the idea of going to the theater to see the movie, if you aren't delivering visuals that can take advantage of the large format?Finally, there was the idea of using non-linear storytelling. This was also something that sounded amazing before watching the movie, but unfortunately due to all the previous issues, it was not a good tool to help the narrative, it only created more confusion.So yeah... Oppenheimer, unfortunately, was not able to match the expectations generated during the marketing campaign of the movie.It was a really cool take, but it feels like there was too much focus on telling the story in a cool way, that something was lost in the way."
"Within the initial two hours of the film, we find ourselves navigating through a labyrinth of superfluous character introductions that seem to yield scant significance to the overarching narrative. A judicious recalibration of the storytelling, discerningly excising extraneous segments, could have undoubtedly remedied the pacing predicament, allowing for a more enthralling cinematic experience. Nolan's virtuosity in crafting intricate timing events is a testament to his filmmaking prowess, yet it's evident that his acumen encounters limitations when attempting to encapsulate the essence of a compelling biopic.Instead of delving unreservedly into the profound moral repercussions stemming from the creation of the atomic bomb, the movie tends to become a socio-political commentary, emblematic of the McCarthy era, inadvertently diluting the gravity of the historical subject matter. One aspect that leaves audiences yearning for a deeper resonance is the film's prevailing fixation on Oppenheimer's reputation and alleged political affiliations.Regrettably, the film unwaveringly adheres to Oppenheimer's and the US military's vantage point, effectively occluding the multifaceted Japanese perspective. This lamentable omission imparts an inescapable sense of incompleteness to the cinematic opus, denying it the full breadth of narrative depth and complexity it could have otherwise attained. While Nolan's cinematic endeavor ostensibly assumes the role of a scrutinizing lens, delving into the post-WWII American witch hunt for communists, it veers into a convolution that subtly sidetracks from the weightier inquiry: the transformation of the US-government into an unwittingly monstrous entity while grappling with the malevolent Nazi threat.It remains perplexing that, even with the presence of dignitaries like Obama, Trump, and Biden at Hiroshima, a formal apology for the cataclysmic atomic bombings remains conspicuously absent, perpetuating the enduring reverberations of history's annals."
"If the film gets you it will leave a deep impact which is hard to recover. I watched the morning show and for the next two days I can't think of anything else and that is the power of cinema. As Scorsese said superhero movies are not cinema and I agree and if you want to know what is cinema then watch this masterpiece. It is Nolan's most subtle and poingnant work may be his best I don't know. The film doesn't rely on heavy breathing spectacle like Nolan's previous works,it is pure drama and everyone must watch it in the biggest possible screen. For cinephiles this film will be a gift but for a one who are into superhero stuffs they should atleast give it a try experience something special."
"This movie is simply, amazing. The way everything is shot, is just, immaculate. Sure, some scenes with their nudity don't make much sense, but with how the camera moves during the explosions is stunning. While, admittedly, during the explosions I was trying to silently eat some candy, the way the sound imitates something like a sonic boom with all the vibrations is astonishing of how realistic this is. When seeing this movie's premise, you'd think maybe it just end with the explosions and it's done, but it goes for another hour after that. You really get to see everything, and feel bad for Oppenheimer at the end. While, yes, I did watch Barbie right before this (having quite the mood change) I was still amazed at how good this movie was. Great watch as long as you don't mind the 3 or so minutes of nudity spread across the film and you want to just go ""Wow"" while being on the literal edge of your seat."
"Oppenheimer is an absolute triumph in every sense! This biographical masterpiece artfully depicts the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, and the exceptional performances by Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer and Robert Downey Jr. As Strauss deserve standing ovations. Murphy's ability to capture Oppenheimer's complex persona, from scientific brilliance to inner struggles, was simply astounding. Equally praiseworthy was Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Strauss, effortlessly bringing depth and charisma to the character.The cinematography in Oppenheimer is awe-inspiring. In particular, the scene showcasing the Trinity bomb's mushroom cloud was a visual marvel. Nolan's skillful use of visuals transported the audience into that historic moment, evoking a mix of emotions ranging from awe to reflection. The movie's attention to historical accuracy and meticulous research added to its authenticity and made it a compelling journey through one of the most pivotal periods in history.From start to finish, Oppenheimer keeps you hooked with its engaging storytelling, impeccable pacing, and thought-provoking dialogue. It delves into the ethical dilemmas faced by Oppenheimer and his team during the creation of the atomic bomb, leaving audiences pondering the consequences of scientific advancements and the weight of responsibility that accompanies such discoveries.The supporting cast delivered commendable performances, enriching the overall narrative. The film's soundtrack seamlessly complemented the visual brilliance, enhancing the emotional impact of every scene.In conclusion, Oppenheimer is a remarkable achievement that deserves widespread recognition. It sheds light on the fascinating life of J. Robert Oppenheimer while raising poignant questions about the implications of scientific progress. Kudos to the entire cast and crew for delivering an extraordinary cinematic experience that will linger in the minds of viewers long after the credits roll. A must-watch for any movie enthusiast and history aficionado alike."
"After an hour or more of pure dialogue in different rooms, different time layers and ever-changing protagonists, the film starts finally when they start composing the first bomb.Then also the score starts matching with the story, which was in the first half sometimes over the top.In opposite to some comments, claiming that the last part should have been shorter, for me this was the most satisfying third, a thrilling courtroom story, where the fast time changes definitely made a lot of more sense than in the first half, where they just made it difficult to get into the story and develop some sympathy or at least understanding for the characters.Robert Downey jr. Outshines a great cast with a multifaceted Cilian Murphy (Oppenheimer is definitely not my favorite character), a very sympathetic Matt Damon and a pretty believable Emily Blunt.I'm not sure if the dialogue part is necessary, maybe even good the second watch, but the effort is worth it."
"Very good movie but can understand it being draining and too long for some people to the point that it gets boring and you fall out.Of course you'll get very good acting, depend on classical dark nolan style and beautiful cinematic.A part of history that is so important and revolutionary done perfectly imo.I enjoyed the long stretches and dialogues to really get the sense and feel everything through J. Robert Oppenheimer.It's like the more you see and observe the more you understand everything about the movie.You really have to be turned on and tuned to watch it if you want to get something from this movie. I am sure you'll like it if you want to end up with that."
"I recently had the pleasure of watching a highly anticipated movie that had been generating a lot of buzz. I was excited to see it and had high expectations, and I have to say, I was not disappointed. The movie had a great story that kept me engaged from start to finish, and the suspense was palpable throughout. The characters were well-developed and the acting was superb, which only added to the overall experience.However, I have to agree with some other reviewers that there was nothing particularly special about watching the movie in 70 mm IMAX format. While it did provide a larger and more immersive viewing experience, I don't think it added much to the overall enjoyment of the movie. In fact, I think the movie would be just as enjoyable on a regular IMAX or even a regular screen.That being said, I still highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good story and well-crafted suspense. It's a great example of how a movie can be successful without relying on flashy gimmicks or special effects. The story is what matters most, and this movie delivers in spades. So if you're looking for a great movie to watch, give this one a try. You won't be disappointed."
"I would say it s the best film seen in a while, but i didn t watch too many. I went it without seeing any trailer reviews and so on, and just bcs cillian is playing and that is a good film. I am a student and never really liked history stuff and wars and for sure i struggled a bit wtaching but it all connected . Stayed with wikipedia opened at some parts and oh wow "" it all makes sense"". I wouldn t say it is too long and for me the last third of the film was the most entertaining one. Before the bomb is just a story after the bomb is the real stuff. And i left that cinema room amazed of what i just watched . The actors were impeccable and the scened as well, dark mysterious good effects. I wish i has seen it imax but i dont have it in my town. All in all it is worth seeing."
"After watching this movie, I couldn't say a word to express how much this movie was AMAZING, every second was meaningful, it was a 3hours movie but I didn't feel that I watched 3 hours I had the feeling that I wanted more !!!It was incredible from the start till the end,
Christopher Nolan did an amazing job,
And the casting was WOWWW
Like all characters were so good played by the actors.They knew who to choose to play oppenheimer, and Cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar!!Not only him all the cast of this movie deserve an Oscar for the best movie, and I hope that it will be listed in 250 top movies of all time !!"
"The internet created a huge hype about this movie. The Bomb and Nolan maybe the reason. In the movie, there was more dialogues (especially in the train which doesn't made any sense) than the making of the bomb. The cinematographer was descent and Nolan did well. Murphy carried the whole movie. There was some miscasts but overall an average movie. The bomb test was a great experience, didn't expected it. It was like a biopic and anyone cam enjoy the movie with proper knowledge about Oppenheimer. People may watch the movie more than one time to understand the storyline. Just have to say that people expected more from Nolan."
"Nolan's long awaited Oppenheimer is here , and to put it frankly, it 's a bomb. This is a cash grab, Oscar bait and (maybe) a tentpole rolled into one. Murphy s decent in the title role and some of the cinematography is good, but it will be hard to stay awake through most of it. Long, dull and pointless sequences go on for just too long. When the next sequence comes, you probably will have forgotten the previous one. And on, and on and on it goes for three l-o-n-g hours. About the best aspect that is touched upon is the guilt he feels after his creation is used. Also then time period of the 40s to 50s is presented in a matter of fact, non nostalgic fashion and Blunt is fairly decent as his wife. Kenneth Branagh has some decent scenes impersonating Nils Bohr However,Matt Damon seems ill at ease in his role. Now back to the review. Even though Oppenheimer probably had no idea of the Pandora's box he would be opening, it must be remembered that at least a million or more Japanese and American lives would have been lost if America was to invade Japan. It also touches on his personal life and his run-ins with the State Department when it is revealed his wife is a communist. Now don't get me wrong. I'm a history buff and a movie fan and I have no problem with long historical film biographies like 'Lawrence of Arabia', 'Gandhi' and 'Patton'. These were gripping, well made, exceptionally well acted films by master directors. Unfortunately in this era of diminished expectations about the entire movie going experience. Director Nolan is still very wet behind the ears and still has a lot to learn before he can even consider making a film of that magnitude Most likely this film will appear to techno geeks and algebra nerds, but you want a real feature about Oppenheimer, you'll be better off renting good documentary on the subject. Though its not as junk movie like 'The Dial of Destiny', at best it's an interesting misfire and a waste of three hours. Another PU movie review from Lou in a miserable movie summer."
"As an older gentleman, I was entirely engrossed in this tale, but what stunned me more was the fact that my highly critical 29 year old daughter, a Marvel and Disney obsessive, rates this as highly as I do!Without ANY pressure from me either.Nolan - total respect
Cast - total respect
Story and adaptation - absolute respect.I really hope this wipes the floor at awards time. Thoroughly deserved and although just having seen this today, I'm already booking up to see it again. No doubt when 4k or blu-ray comes around, it'll be on my list, but even though it was seen on digital IMAX (sadly not able to go to 70mm IMAX in London), it is such a deeply engrossing telling of Oppenheimer's complex character."
"It should be known that Oppenheimer is, in many ways, a massive departure from previous Christoper Nolan films, and even includes nude scenes which have gained some media controversy. (On that note, there is an absolutely bizarre sex scene in a board room.) While many Nolan films always have a profound contemplative tone that is coupled with gunshots, constant explosions and doomsday clocks, Oppenheimer most definitely appeals to a different audience that is more ruminative, introverted, and startled by loud bangs. If you are expecting a cathartic roller coaster ride, you should not be paying for admission (or an IMAX ticket for that matter). It will be a waste of your time and you can immediately reduce my rating to five stars or lower. But if you are the ruminative introverted type that loves a profound drama great enough to send you into contemplation for a time, the film will give you what you're looking for.With that taken into consideration, the film is the ultimate portrayal of the father of the nuclear bomb. From the time your curiosity is piqued before the film, to the hours during the film that you are bombarded with its endless dramatic chaos, the film buries us in the emotions and thoughts of Oppenheimer's world. In doing so, the film invites us to consider the immeasurable consequences of the bomb as felt through Oppenheimer, but also as people who have to live in a world that constantly teeters on the verge of transforming into a radioactive wasteland. Much like the mysterious wave-particle duality of Quantum Mechanics, the movie itself is a duality. The fusion and fission of opposites defines the movie and its tortured lead protagonist. The plot itself is structured like the bomb. At the core of the film is Los Alamos, and the film's events both prior to and after it are surrounded with all the modern dysfunctions of the human being. The fallout of the test includes internal and external politics reminiscent of Julius Caesar, disordered relationships, neurotic breakdowns, endless civilian deaths. And yet in the midst of all that is also patriotism, ingenuity, victory, glory, and a willingness to put aside all kinds of differences to have the bomb before the Nazis do. And while we do not physically witness a single casualty from a bomb explosion in the entire film, this chaotic chain reaction of performances are so effectively conveyed that we don't need to see people dying to understand how dreadfully terrifying it is for man to have the power to destroy the known world. The depths to which the movie plunges you in thought comes from the exceptional performances of the film's cast, which are so adept at conveying the horrors, the guilt, the tragedy, the joy, the victory, and the dichotomy that is the nuclear bomb. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer is aesthetically exceptional, reflecting Oppie's mannerisms, tone of voice, and silent charisma such that he may as well be in the 1950s black and white films of old. More than anything, Cillian exceptionally communicates Oppenheimer's dichotomies: his gentleness coupled with his power, his hubris and humility, his charm and his ugliness, his sense of moral right and his tortured conscience. Opposite of him, Robert Downey Jr. Puts aside his charismatic whimsical typecast and portrays a very serious, humorless, and subtly vicious Lewis Strauss. And although I felt Robert Downey was not nearly as convincing as Cillian, he damn well gave one of the best performances of his life. The two are supported by an all-star cast that are so effective at bringing Oppie's world to life.The movie perfectly captures Christopher Nolan's vision: it has complexity, sophistication, and multiple timelines converging into the core of the bomb conceived in Los Alamos. For better or worse, we experience Oppenheimer totally on Nolan's terms rather than through our own cinematic sensibilities. This may feel boring to some, pretentious to others, or infinitely and morbidly fascinating for the rest of us. For the most latter group, they will be greatly rewarded."
"What could be a three hour yawn turns out to be an explosive combination (pardon the pun) of great story telling and first class performance
Oscar and Bafta winning for film, director and actors alike
You owe it to yourselves to watch this movie it's history and although uncomfortable it show you how once again it's politics that can turn anyone from a hero to a villain - yet they are the true villains - Murphy is compelling Downey Junior shows how to shake off his Tony Stark hero and play a real swine
Blunt as the aggrieved wife is sublime and spot Gary Oldman, surely the best UK character
Edgy compelling directing from Chris Nolan with a great use of perspective
We really don't know Oppenheimer and now we have a window on his world well worth the wait!"
"Even more impressive was the musical score. Love the pivotal point when the music stopped. But not forever. The cinematography subtle change led to an even more emotional response to these amazing actors. Casting was amazing and ""Kitty"" and her character were crucial to understanding the mental stress that he was trying to process. She was the sanity check in his unbelievable world. Tellar, I think represented all of us, going along for the ride and trying to be decent people, but still afraid to speak out against what might feel wrong in the world but also wanted to make a name for ourselves as well. Even the fact that it was mentioned, be it small, that the land should go back to the native Indians that occupied it before he bought the land, was true to history. Nowadays, it crucial we tell the truth and not hide from our ugly history. We are who we are. Go see it."
Nothing much to say. Quite a different taste from Christopher Nolan. Great job by literally everyone in this film. Cillian Murphy as well as RDJ put on a crazy performances. It was a pleasure seeing all these great physicists and how they are connected to each other. People interested in theoretical physics gonna absolutely love this.It was more of a political visualisation. Cinematography was certainly on another level. Hoyte van Hoytema deserves even more recognition. Aside from great acting performances the soundtrack is just insane. It was a great experience and I'll talk about everything later in details.
"Loved the movie and watched it to the end without blinking.Don't take popcorn's vs vs which make noise inside cinema. Just concentrate on the movie and enjoy it.All my idol physicists , I'll watch it again definitely. Definitely go for IMAX if you have access I couldn't find tickets for imax it's completely sold out so just went to a normal screen so my second time would be imax for sure waiting for a slot with free seats to go at London.Seeing Oppenheimer, Niels Bohr, Albert Einstein, Heisenberg, even if am not wrong and heard correctly in a scene he says Erwin Schrödingers name too.I mean hearing their names and seeing then I relay loved the movie to the end."
"This is the first film that I have watched in theaters, and I am very happy to know and feel the extraordinary viewing experience this film has presented.Overall, I get a view from the description of Oppenheimer's own living conditions, and this film is truly extraordinary and they can package it well.And my advice to audiences who want to enjoy this film well is that you can dig into Oppenheimer's history and what events happened at that time, or watch the documentary version first, which is ""To End All War: Oppenheimer & the Atomic Bomb (2023)"", to be honest even though at the beginning the film was ""Complicated"" and my friend fell asleep several times earlier, but I can understand it a little bit well, and by knowing more information about Oppenheimer you will enjoy this film well, you will gain cinematographic experience presentation, actor/actress expression, visual audio, etc. With extraordinary results.Thank you to all parties involved in making this film, my first experience watching it in a theaters was truly extraordinary and will be very memorable for me, good job guys."
"Christopher Nolan's latest movie, ""Oppenheimer,"" delves into a fascinating story that combines history and quantum physics in a surprising and visually powerful manner. Contrary to what one might expect from a Nolan film, the exploration of quantum physics is relatively accessible, making the movie enjoyable for a broader audience. In this review, I will try to highlight the significant aspects of the film while avoiding spoilers.The most exceptional aspect of ""Oppenheimer"" is undoubtedly its compelling storyline. While it does take some liberties with historical facts, it skillfully portrays the complex figure of Oppenheimer and the grim reality of American involvement in World War II as a necessary evil of war. Nolan's tendency to twist the truth to suit the narrative is not unprecedented in American cinema, and he does the same here.Breaking away from his comfort zone of intricate scientific concepts, Nolan delivers a visually impactful and easy-to-understand movie. Explaining the particulars of making an atom bomb is no small feat, but the film presents these microscopic processes visually engagingly.The performances of the talented ensemble cast contribute significantly to the movie's success. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer is commendable, but Robert Downey Jr., As Lewis Strauss, steals the show. Downey Jr.'s phenomenal acting proves that he is more than just a superhero icon and deserves an Oscar nomination for his remarkable performance in Oppenheimer.""Oppenheimer"" is a film that demands attention and appreciation for its depth and scope. It may cater to something other than those seeking a casual movie-watching experience with popcorn and soda. Instead, it invites the audience to immerse themselves in the narrative, relax, and enjoy the unfolding story. Fans of superhero blockbusters might find this movie less appealing, but for those who seek meaningful cinema, ""Oppenheimer"" is a treat.The choice to watch the film in a unique engagement 70MM theatre instead of an IMAX proved to be an indifferent experience for me. Nolan's decision to forego making another unnecessary 3D movie enhanced the overall experience, allowing the story and performances to take center stage.Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" is a fantastic addition to Nolan's filmography, earning the title of my second favourite Nolan film after ""Interstellar."" It showcases Nolan's ability to tackle complex subjects and transform them into compelling stories quickly. While some might question the need for this movie to be made by Nolan and argue that anyone could have made it, I believe Nolan's distinct touch makes it unique, transforming what could have been a complex and tedious film into an appealing masterpiece.Rating: 9/10Strengths: Engaging storyline, visually captivating presentation of quantum physics, exceptional acting by Robert Downey Jr.Weakness (beyond screening): Unnecessary controversy surrounding IMAX vs. 70mm, a minor distraction in an otherwise remarkable film.#oppenheimer #ShamimAhmed #robertdowneyjr #cillianmurphy."
"Oppenheimer. It's hard for me to describe what I have just seen! Christopher Nolan made the impossible possible. He gave us a unique biography movie with great plot. When it comes to acting, Cillian Murphy gave us the best performance in 2023 so far. His eyes and how they reacted is something extraordinary. Robert downey Jr was magnificent , and all the supporting actors were. Spectacular. What I mostly liked about the movie is that it showed us how human are brutal and dont give a heck about others. The sound mixing was nice even though I miss Hans' Zimmer creativity. Finally Oppenheimer is the best movie in 2023 but not the number movie in Christopher Nolan list."
"I'm just coming from the cinema and boy, was this a drag. Long, dull and unexciting. You had one job, Nolan, do a great a-bomb explosion. Show, don't tell us how powerful it is. Show, don't tell us about the devastations in Japan. Show, don't tell us how remorseful Oppenheimer is after the bombings. It's all talk and nothing visually exciting to warrant a cinema visit. I'm not surprised by the low box office results of this movie. Sure, it's filmed well, lots of stars in it, but it's the wrong movie to make, it is very boring and way too long. We were 11 people, everyone was disappointed and one of the girls feel asleep multiple times, while others, including me, were constantly looking at their watches.Anyway, you are warned. Now I'm getting back to studying Sanskrit."
"While we may all be acquainted with the storyline of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the film attempts an audacious feat by splicing and reordering multiple periods of his life, attempting to craft a fragmented mosaic that, alas, falls short of coherence. The ill-conceived endeavour leaves audiences grappling to piece together the historical segments in a meaningful way, leading to a frustrating lack of understanding of their significance to the overarching narrative.Throughout the cinematic journey, the incessant splicing proves to be the Achilles' heel, preventing the film from delving deeper into the various storylines that shaped Oppenheimer's destiny. A lamentable example lies in the scant attention given to the conception of the H-bomb, which is relegated to a mere fleeting mention during a debate at Los Alamos. One can't help but yearn for a more profound exploration of this pivotal moment, a crucial juncture in the annals of scientific history that cries out for greater elucidation.Perhaps most vexing is the film's reluctance to shed light on one of the most critical questions surrounding Oppenheimer - his alleged association with communism. The shadow of uncertainty looms large, leaving audiences grasping for answers that never come. The denial of a deeper understanding of Oppenheimer's political leanings robs the narrative of the nuance it so desperately requires, and by extension, diminishes the potency of the central conflict surrounding the withdrawal of his AEC security clearance.Ironically, a troubling revelation arises for those who sought to glean insights into Oppenheimer's life from this film. It becomes painfully apparent that one might have been better served perusing his Wikipedia entry or watching the documentary 'The Day after Trinity.' In those mediums, Oppenheimer's life unfolds chronologically, granting a sense of coherence and a true appreciation of the man and his profound impact on history.In the end, 'Oppenheimer' fails to achieve the lofty aspirations it set for itself. It meanders through its own ambitious convolution, leaving audiences perplexed and disheartened by a missed opportunity to illuminate one of history's most intriguing minds. With a more focused and chronological approach, the film might have risen to greatness, but alas, it remains a lamentable casualty of its own artistic experimentation."
"A great movie, a legendary movie, a movie that lives you in the days of the World War and the days of Oppenheimer, and how he was thinking of ending the war, a movie for history. A great movie, a legendary movie, a movie that lives you in the days of the World War and the days of Oppenheimer, and how he was thinking of ending the war, a movie for history A great movie, a legendary movie, a movie that lives you in the days of the World War and the days of Oppenheimer, and how he was thinking of ending the war, a movie for history A great movie, a legendary movie, a movie that lives you in the days of the World War and the days of Oppenheimer, and how he was thinking of ending the war, a movie for history."
"That was the first thing I heard someone in the audience say when the movie ended, and I tend to agree. This film was very densely packed and required all of your attention from start to finish. Also, as someone who was not previously familiar with Oppenheimer's life, I found myself having to be twice as attentive. Of course Cillian Murphy was brilliant as Oppenheimer, his performance is truly what kept me engaged throughout those 3 hours. I really liked the cinematography as well, Nolan did a great job at communicating both the beauty and horror of the atomic bomb. Overall I'd say this isn't a film for the average movie goer, or someone just looking to pass the time on a Friday night. This will require your brain to be flipped on and it will take some time to digest after the fact."
"Being one of the most-fan-favorite & a promising director, Christopher Nolan has once again hit the audience with a historical masterpiece. Although Oppenheimer is much deviated from typical Nolan's style of huge scientific theories & insane plot twists, the movie had it's Nolan vibe in the screenplay, cast, background score as well as the buildup.The performance by the cast was perfect with the exceptional acting of Cillian Murphy & Robert Downey Jr which may help writing their names against an Academy Award this year. The character build up was incredible.Trinity test was one of the best scenes I've ever experienced in a movie and was a complete visual treat.Nolan seemed to has pay attention to every single detail and the movie was very well contained the story of making the atomic bomb.Anyway the dialogues with various accents were sometimes not much clear so might need a very sharp focus on the movie to understand."
"Oppenheimer boasts an outstanding performance by Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer himself. His portrayal adds depth and authenticity to the character, complementing the film's overall brilliance. Nolan's choice to cast Murphy further elevates this already compelling cinematic experience.Cillian Murphy's extraordinary portrayal of Oppenheimer deserves an Oscar nomination and recognition. His nuanced and captivating performance elevates the character to new heights, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.Leaving the cinema, I felt kinda weird after watching the movie. All thanks to the amazing cinematography and plot."
"The movie is really great, and I advise people to go to the cinema, especially IMAX, in proportion to me. This is the movie of the year, and he should take the Oscar seriously, especially since the movie is very focused on Oppenheimer's life and his feelings after the inventor of the bomb, and how much he invented something that people will destroy each other with. Unfortunately, this is a real horror movie, but if you focus on it The goal of the film is really, you will feel the horror, and I liked the twist at the end of the film, and the hatred of the genius actor Robert Downey Jr., who actually played the role of Oscar, and of course we will not talk about Cillian Murphy's flawless performance, and how director Christopher Nolan was able to film all this for you, and really, you always felt the headache that he felt Bey Oppenheimer and Izzy were imagining the nucleus and atoms, real creativity, and although the movie is 3 hours, it is true, the scenes are very fast."
"A compelling, eye opening story. As well as incredibly visually appealing in its 70mm glory, for a movie that was majority talking there was never a dull moment. The actors were fantastic. Cillians eyes showed everything and portrayed emotions the real J Robert Oppenheimer showed in real footage phenomenally. The movie felt like a thriller and had me on the edge of my seat in some scenes. The score was also incredible and presented so many emotions that's created moods and tension throughout the film. For the first time in a while I left the theatre speechless and moved and this movie really got me thinking. Once again Christopher Nolan has created a terrific film."
"After hearing review, opinions, and feedback on the movie following the hype of its release, I gave it a watch which I was planning to do anyway.For being 3 hours, I surprisingly didn't mind it's length. It surprisingly kept my mind occupied. It didn't drag on, it flowed somewhat naturally despite the slower parts at time.The cinematography was 10/10
The music was 9/10
Acting & cast 10/10
Story 10/10Not my favorite of Christopher Nolan's favorite work, but in the top 5 for sure.I did feel the nude scenes did distract a bit from the story. I felt they could have accomplished the goal they were aiming to portray without showing graphic nudity. It gave some context, But I just got the sense that it didn't really contribute or add any significant value, in a meaningful way to what was going on. I feel there are ways you can demonstrate that in an effective manner without that kind of display.It was a very well rounded film in all areas."
"Just a heads up for everyone expecting an action movie with atomic bombs. No. It's a highly political drama, but even if you don't care about constant communism accusations, it is still 1.5 hours worth of very good scientific content. As expected, it contains a huge amount of well known as well as many ""smaller"" actors, everyone doing their part to create yet another masterpiece. The movie also demonstrates that Nolan is very capable of portraying a historically accurate 1940s, yet not abandoning amazing and high quality shots.Personally, I'm not a fan of the concept of non linear storytelling, but Nolan manages to tie all ends together and leave little room for questions."
"This is a fantastic bit of historical drama/biopic. The cast is universally flawless, and the film does an excellent treatment of the complex personalities involved. I thought they got Teller and Szilard particularly well, after Oppenheimer himself. They also did a great job with Bohr and Lawrence, and even the small bits of Feynman's history are easy to see here. If you know this topic from the histories that have been written of it, you will recognize everyone. I'm surprised to say that I found Damon to be the weakest in his portrayal of Groves, but that could be the writing, as Groves was both a famously difficult man to work with and an overweight slob of a human. It would be difficult for anyone except perhaps someone like John Goodman to portray him effectively.My biggest complaint of the film is that it is too long. Its presumed climax is followed by a good 45-60 minutes of plot that is essentially courtroom drama, but devolves into a Nolan-style psychological thriller. Perhaps it was the cinema I was in, but I found the dialogue in these sections to be very difficult to follow, and sometimes even a bit difficult to hear/understand properly. I'll look forward to a rewatch with subtitles.I've seen some people complain that the film is glamorizing a monster, and that no Japanese people are portrayed. I think this is a profoundly shallow interpretation of history. Oppenheimer was (and is shown to be) extremely conflicted, as were most of the people involved in this project. The stark reality is that once nuclear weapons were possible, someone was going to make them. I think we are lucky it was the Manhattan Project first. As for the Japanese, perhaps consider the plight of the Chinese and many other peoples who the Japanese conquered, tortured, raped, and pillaged first."
"There was nothing i liked about this movie especially the thing youre waiting for. The dialogue is hackneyed, performances campy and forced, Florence Pugh mostly. Super contrived everything. Wanted to love it, wanted to learn. Just felt like i was seeing a writers room laying out forced scene after forced scene. The weirdest thing was how everyone looked, the make up, Cillian Murphys skeleton body... And who wants to see another courts case trial movie? Thats what this is if you didnt know. A trial where they flashback to the events that led them there like the flicks where someone is getting interrogated. Boring. Boring. Boring."
"A masterclass in film making. Nolan has been consistently creating fantastic films for years and 'Oppenheimer' is no exception. Dialogue, cinematography and pacing are all on point. Ludwig's score is a perfect match for the aesthetic of the film. I have no doubt that Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt and ESPECIALLY Robert Downey Jr and Cillian Murphy will all be up for awards, alongside Nolan and the movie itself. A future classic to be sure. As far as historical biopics go, a difficult and perhaps sensitive topic to tackle given its relevance today, but the messages and philosophy's shown through how the narrative is written and how history is represented throughout the movie is something I'm sure people will remember. 9/10."
"The actors and the acting performance were fascinating i loved cillian murphy in this movie but the sounds effect are an actor in this film too.no boring shots or momment nollan made somthing maybe with Nolan made something that some people could have. It is a boring thing for a beer. Something fun, visual and audio, right on the screen. It is one of the most important events of the well, and it is the making of the atomic bomb that changed the future of mankind. I advise anyone to see the movie in the cinema, you will regret it if you miss it... Because at a time when cinema was boring and people did not listen to cinema, Nolan came up with a movie that revives the spirit of cinema."
"Christopher nolan at his BEST. Absolutely loved it. Sure some people could find it too long or boring because its 3hours long and mostly just talking, i was also kind of expecting it to be boring at some parts but nope the dialogue was actually interesting and fast paced. The SCORE and the CAST is something else I would be surprised if Cillain Murphy doesnt get atleast and oscar nomination for the performance. There were many others too who were excellent like RDJ, Emily blunt, Josh hartnett. And the very first scene is amazing once you're at the end you'll know what it means.Also loved how they did the trinity test was haunting when its just silence for half a minute everyone was holding their breath in the theatre."
"If you're looking for major explosions and an action packed film, this is NOT it. This is practical effects, amazing dialogue and good view on Oppenheimer and his life and the history of the atom bomb and the moral quagmire on the impact on humanity because of it. Thought provoking and the realization that you can be the smartest man In the room but you have people who want to discredit that. Only reason for not giving it at 10/10 is because the run time. You can feel it towards the end. The run time is worth it however to make sure that you get the entirety of Oppenheimer's life from the start and post WW2."
"Totally blown away by the message as well as the cinematic performance.The film's claiming remarked allude to an analogy which is one of the most defining messages I have taken from a motion picture, certainly when it comes to our collective impact on Earth and civilisation.The screenplay is remarkable to simultaneously switch between 3 or 4 timelines within minutes again and again.Watching it in IMAX was certainly the right decision. The richness of film made the experience all the more authentic.Cillian Murphy's performance is stellar as is RDJ's.I am waiting with baited breath to watch again.Intense. Rich. Atomic."
"Oppenheimer is an extraordinary historical drama that captivated me from start to finish. The production's attention to detail in recreating the era of the Manhattan Project was impressive, transporting the audience to a pivotal moment in history. The acting performances were exceptional, with each character fully embodying their role and bringing a depth of emotion that kept me engaged throughout.The writing in Oppenheimer was truly remarkable, blending historical accuracy with thought-provoking dialogue that explored the complexities of the characters' decisions and the ethical dilemmas they faced. It skillfully delved into the personal struggles and aspirations of J. Robert Oppenheimer, portraying him as a multi-dimensional figure rather than just a historical icon.The direction of the play was top-notch, seamlessly guiding the story's progression and creating a dynamic and immersive experience. The set design and staging were also outstanding, effectively setting the tone for each scene and complementing the narrative.Oppenheimer's ability to tackle profound themes such as the consequences of scientific advancements, the weight of moral responsibility, and the sacrifices made for the greater good left a lasting impact on me. It stimulated thoughtful contemplation long after the curtain fell.I highly recommend Oppenheimer to anyone seeking an intelligent and compelling theatrical experience. Whether you are interested in history, science, or simply appreciate a well-crafted production, this play will undoubtedly leave you inspired and in awe of the human spirit's complexities."
"This is true Nolan movie in every aspect that lives upto the hype surrounding it. The cinematography is just unreal and I saw this in a true DL2 1:43 IMAX theatre. Its a treat to watch if you even have some experience working with cameras and scenes. Lots of immersive scenes and the background score is intense by Ludwig.If I had to pick one shortcoming, that would be the length of the movie, as it feels slightly dragged in the trial scenes. I also think is mainly because some of the dialogues seem muffled with the intense background score when there are conversations of the trial and you kind of lose track sometimes. This was also in some way the problem with Tenet too.Nonetheless, I feel this might be a 10/10 once I go through a second screening. Never have I ever had the urge and the excitement for a second screening of a movie except for Interstellar!"
"An excellent beautiful masterpiece. The steller cast gave all to bring alive one of the most important events of our history. Cillin Murphy, Robert Downey was phenomenal. And not only him, each and every performance were at the top of their game. Nolan provided us with an opportunity to witness history. Three hours went by like it was nothing. Watch it with an audience, and this masterpiece will make you feel something different. In the end, you start to think, the weight of our actions as a human, the lives everything, you start to re-evaluate all.Beautiful, extraordinary. Cinema at its best."
"I always like to consider what directors decide to do when it comes to post production on epics like this. Some directors will choose to use music sparingly, while in some movies, although rare, the director opts to have no music at all. This one not only has music throughout, it is also loud and melodramatic, playing like a Dodge Ram commercial, for three very long hours.The story is quite compelling, but told in fits and starts, and certainly in a non-linear direction. The acting is solid, the distractions many. I would have liked it more with about 25 minutes less footage and a lot less music.Overall a good film but be prepared for the long haul and some occasional glances at your watch."
"If you had told me Nolan would ever, ever had made a film so boring, disconnected, scattered, and pointless that I would walk out of a theater for the first time in 19 years, leave my friends, and brave the Texas heat to get home... No chance... Right?Yet here we are. Leaving theaters in Texas heat because that is literally better than this movie. Words can and will describe how high the pyramid of bad and boring goes up in this film. There is no foundation. There is not setup. Scenes and editing are a disaster. You are slingshot around to oceans of random ideas, characters, and scenes that never, ever apply a foundation. The story has no flow and neither to countless other ideas or situations that Nolan tries to explore. It is an overbearing nightmare of why? It is shocking to me how little focus a film had to deliver ANY form of emotion, thrill, or excitement from any scene. The biggest heart pound I got was when you are literally sound bombed with atomic explosions at random, quite, dramatic scenes... Felt like I was playing with a Jack in the Box while trying very hard to grasp how bad the movie was... Didn't help.The amount of different scenes in just the first hour is dizzying, especially when you literally have no idea what the movie is even trying to tell you. It felt like Oppy was the main character, but you are literally put into a warp drive of random scenes that don't add up in anyway to something that can be understood. Then, the rush continues to tell a very interesting story in the most boring and elaborate way possible. Baffling. Like trying to understand oceans of movie clips thrown out onto a table like puzzle pieces all at once. I am shocked this film didn't have reshoots and a total overhaul in the editing. Scenes were so short and so empty. You are almost begging to feel anything other than boredom. The amount of times Emily Blunt just APPEARS on the screen due to insanely fast cuts to totally different scenes, with random situations, and random time periods... Total circus fiesta and completely stunned I am even writing this about a Nolan movie still.While information is being thrown at you about random people and random things, you really are just sitting there wondering why we are not more focused on the story? The man? The bomb? His feelings, his inner workings. All the political stories Nolan tries to sell seemingly are trying to compete with what the movie should be about. There are far, far, far too many ideas in this insanely bloated and off script. The time jumps, subject jumps, emotional jumps, political jumps are a total circus. This is a total disaster and it is shocking that this is the work of Nolan. In no way does this even remotely come together as a film.Not to be overly insulting, but I absolutely hate poor theater behavior and disrespecting others. I have never, in any film in my life, seen more people checking their phone... Not for social media. Not for anything other than to check the time. From the first hour till the end, everyone in the theater, who were of course silent through this entire disaster, couldn't wait to be gone. I even chuckled after the first couple of people kept checking the time (1 hour into the movie) I laughed internally to myself, ""LOL go ahead friend... and way ahead of you.""This is far and away the most disjointed, boring, and emotionless film I have seen in a very long time. This is a massive let down as a Nolan fan. This really continues to speak to flaws in his craft that are not just hanging around, but getting stronger. You can literally lose count of the missed opportunities to better a scene, stop the rush, and allow the audience to feel and connect... to anything...Matt Damon is absolutely brilliant and carries this film to the 2/10 it deserves.Thanks for reading. ~"
"One of the best movies i have ever seen. The music, cinematography, cast and story are marvelous. Cilian Murphy outdid himself with this one. Christopher Nolan shows once again why he is one of the best directors Out there. A story like oppenheimers is one that deserves a movie of this quality. Every actor played their role superbly, which you could expect from such a cast. Every scene was important, noteworthy and felt like you had to watch it. Not a single unnessecary moment, joke or character that was added for the storyline, the story itself was amazing enough. I dont know how they did it, but this might be one of the best movies of all time. Wow."
"As an avid fan of historical biopics, Oppenheimer left me utterly mesmerized and profoundly moved. Directed by the unparalleled talent, Christopher Nolan, this film delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist who led the scientific team that developed the atomic bomb during World War II.From the very beginning, it was evident that the production team spared no expense in recreating the era with stunning attention to detail. The cinematography and visual effects were nothing short of breathtaking, transporting the audience back in time to witness the monumental events that shaped modern history. Nolan's signature style of blending non-linear storytelling with intense character-driven arcs elevated the narrative to unparalleled heights.Casting Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer was a stroke of genius. Murphy's performance was nothing short of extraordinary, capturing the essence of Oppenheimer's complex personality - his brilliance, struggles, and the moral dilemmas he faced. The supporting cast, including seasoned actors like Tom Hanks, Viola Davis, and Helen Mirren, delivered outstanding performances that added depth and authenticity to the story.The screenplay, penned by Aaron Sorkin, was a work of art in itself. The dialogues were gripping and thought-provoking, delving into the ethical questions surrounding scientific advancements and the consequences of harnessing the power of the atom. Sorkin masterfully weaved together personal relationships, scientific discoveries, and political intrigue, keeping the audience engaged from start to finish.The film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, perfectly complemented the atmosphere, enhancing emotional moments and driving the tension during critical scenes. Zimmer's music has the power to linger long after the credits roll.Oppenheimer is not just a biographical account; it is a philosophical exploration of humanity's potential for creation and destruction. It forces us to confront the consequences of our actions and ponder the true meaning of progress.While some may argue that the film took creative liberties with historical events, it is important to remember that it is a work of art, not a documentary. Nolan skillfully balances authenticity with cinematic flair, creating a powerful and thought-provoking narrative.In conclusion, Oppenheimer is an intellectual masterpiece that will resonate with audiences for years to come. It showcases the brilliance and flaws of a man who played a pivotal role in shaping the modern world, and it does so with cinematic prowess rarely seen in historical dramas. Christopher Nolan has once again proven himself as a visionary filmmaker, and Oppenheimer stands tall as one of the finest films of its time."
"#Oppenheimer is by riveting film he's ever made. The sheer amount of information and detail is astonishing. It's not going to be his most watchable being that it's 3 hours of drama. This will require multiple viewings to get everything. On the technical side Nolan creates some of the most visual spectacles I've witnessed and he's absolutely going to win an Oscar for sound. Everyone including Florence Pugh and Matt Damon were incredible but Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr and Emily Blunt are going to go heavy on awards night. Also this may very well be Christopher Nolans win. There's some pacing issues as I felt like it at times did feel like 3 hours but there's times where it flew by. This movie is an absolute blast (pun intended).10/10."
"Before I start, I'd like to say that I have been a huge fan of Nolan's work so fair warning that my review might be a little biased.Little does it matter however when you consider the colorful reviews of hundreds of others as well.Firstly this movie is not for everyone, it's not your average action movie, guns and military. It's an illustrating documentary that follows the life and experiences of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Through his joys and struggles. All of the actors have played an important part in the movie though small or large. RDJ specially has my heart for his phenomenal performance with such a short screen time. As for Cillian Murphy, it goes without saying the man is a legend.The background score was exciting and adds to the intensity of the scene and the visuals were just STUNNING. This movie and Cillian Murphy are certainly Oscar worthy and there is no doubt about that. Easily one of my top watches of all time. I continue to expect such quality films from Christopher Nolan."
"This has got to be one of Nolan's best gifts to movie watchers. Coming in with some expectation, never have I been blown away (no pun intended) by a movie of that magnitude.Some might see this film as a glorification of Oppenheimer or the atomic bomb, or say that this is just a wikipedia film or there's too much politics, I respect your opinion, and would just think that biopics aren't your cup of tea. However, this movie raises the awareness of the capable destruction of such arsenal in the midst of unstable multinational relationships in the status quo. Yes so much of the focus might have been shifted towards how Oppenheimer manifested and eventually lead the efforts in constructing the bomb, but this movie is really about life. The lives it took to construct Los Alamos and the bomb, the lives taken away too soon, and the life of a man who battled morality upon realizing the magnitude of his own doing.Spoiler Alert: The silence upon the bomb's detonation was eerily deafening. That moment alone would have qualified itself as a horror entry, and I have never felt that sensation of holding my breath for so long inside of a movie theatre. And on a personal note, I was not capable of speaking for at least 40 minutes right after the credits rolled. It was that breathtaking.And giving my flowers to all the actors who portrayed historical figures with so much persuasion, wow. Just, wow. Writing this review doesn't give their acting any form of justice."
"I had high hopes for this film, but it far exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend seeing it in IMAX, because it is visually stunning. On any screen it's still a masterpiece. There were so many stories that could have been told about Oppenheimer, but the way they told the story was so respectful yet captured so many important aspects of his life. With all the controversy, complexity, and mystery that surrounds this story, be it politics, ethics, or science, this film artfully layered it's scenes with a deep understanding, using metaphors and parallels that left me reeling with contemplation. There are so many layers, that this film can be a completely different movie depending upon how much of this story you knew before, yet still leave you dumbfounded by how beautifully these messages are delivered. The cast is nothing short of magnificent. Christopher Nolan is one of my favorites, but this may be his best yet. It's been more than 24 hours, and I'm still mind blown over how good it really was!"
"A movie that just absolutely captures the importance of profound scientific and global affairs in a spectacular way. It was would be like if Kanye West's ""Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy"" album was a movie. Cillian Murphy puts on a virtuoso performance encapsulating the deeply complicated and contradictory life that Oppenheimer lived. The pace that the movie runs at is so intense and the music is used perfectly to capture that. The explosion of the bomb is so realistically filmed that you feel fully immersed in Los Alamos. The subtle themes of ""The Fission"" and ""The""fusion"" floated at the beginning of the movie is an incredible way to depict to the two separate courtroom like battles Oppenheimer and Strauss are involved in. Nolan has many great movies under his belt but this movie tops them all."
"Christopher Nolan once said that the first six minutes of a movie can define whether the audience stays to the end. He rolls up the curtains of Oppenheimer with an intro about a battle between humankind and the gods of Olympus. And right after that, starts a great game, that play your senses and mind. So yes, you definitely want to stay.First you try to set the genre, but it´s far away from a straight road. Horrific visions, retrospective, monochromatic visuals -all diferent timelines. You are focused, because you are jumping from one to another. But to also keep your interest, the individual timelines are connected by key events and characters, bind by the law of causality. So the narrative is dynamic, but not chaotic and you just can´t wait to unfold more. It´s neither that easy with the protagonist - Robert J. Oppenheimer, the leader of The Manhattan Project, who with the invention of the atomic bomb, changed the whole world forever. Challenging story, right? Should we admire him, hate him, or even feel sorry for him? The great thing is that we, the audience, are draged throught a whole spectrum of emotions about him. He is dangerous, unhinged, narcissist, but at the same time, or different times, he is shown as a martyr, genius and loyal to his statements. It works perfectly with the narrative, because you are not biased by what the director/writer wants you to think. He simply tells you the story.Stylistically, the main character is the dialog. Your focus is guided by a slow camera track-in, beautiful key lighting and camera refocusing on the speaker and listener. Subconscious, elegant.Another key element is time. You are already focused, not lost, immersed and hungry for more. At last, the dynamic editing and music push you to the limits and you are almost on the edge for the whole journey.To summarise it, these different layers work perfectly together. Even after the second act, the narration still holds to its tempo and that is something unique. You are taken on a coherent journey and after 180 minutes you just find yourself at its end.I wanted to stay fully objective (in the sense, that I can somehow argue my statements), but I have to say, that this complexion gave me the feeling, that everybody who worked on Nolan´s Oppenheimer gave a minimum of 100% to its work. The whole star cast, the postproduction, every member of the crew. Just to say that one day, they contributed to this magnum opus."
"Character: 7/10
Story: 4/10
Plot: 5/10
Setting: 8/10
Execution: 6/10
Total: 30/50 (6 stars)If I'm gonna be honest, I have no idea why this movie is so high-rated.This movie follows a physician named Oppenheimer who developed the atomic bombs in the USA that were to be dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. That's about as simple as it can get. I don't see why it needed 3 hours to get to that point; had to check my watch about 5 times to see when the movie was over. Even some of my friends checked their phones about three times.By the way, the characters? Banal and trivial, except some of the main ones. Oppenheimer's personality was charming and nonchalant, and I enjoyed his wit. Einstein's too. But that's it! You don't get much more of the other characters, not even their backstories or motivations in life.The one aspect I did enjoy, however, was the discordance the movie could portray. Although disturbing for some people, I enjoyed the sudden bursts of sound or light, not to mention the suspenseful pauses! It used effects such as whitespace or jump cuts to convey these. But that's really the only thing I was looking forward to.I had high hopes for this movie. I really did. But I hope that, in the future, Chris will step up his game. If you're planning to spend 3 hours watching a movie, just go watch Barbie instead."
"The only reason I saw this movie is because I belong to a movie club.I didn't want to see this movie because of Christopher Nolan. I hate his movies (except Batman).I walked out of this movie with 30 minutes left. It's a 3 hour movie that drags and drags and drags near the end.There were so many scientists and characters I couldn't keep them straight.The inquisition by the Senate dragged and dragged and dragged.Did I mention I hate Christopher Nolan movies?The music score was horrible. I couldn't understand the dialogue between characters because the music was so distracting and when it crescendo'd, I couldn't hear what was being said.Did I mention I hate Christopher nolan movies?Did I mention the movie is 3 hours long? If it's a fast paced 3 hour movie and I don't ""feel"" the time length, I'm alright with it. Sometimes you go into a movie and you're so engaged you don't notice the time. But I kept looking at my watch at the 2:30 point. And then I had to leave.The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because of Emily Blunt. She was the only character I cared about.Wait for this movie to come on streaming. I wish I had seen the Barbie movie instead."
"Oppenheimer is something very unique when compared to a conventional movie. It is a moving experience which captivates the events of the Manhattan Project as well as the life of Robert Oppenheimer. The musical score tied in with the dialogue and storyline takes the audience on a journey through a prominent piece of history. From the time in which the movie started to it's ending, there was not one scene that drew you away from the action of what has taken place. Nolan's creative style has effectively been portrayed in this movie. Definitely worth watching in a cinema to get the full experience of what this masterpiece has to offer. This movie may not be for everyone, but is something that everyone should see in their lifetime."
"Although Cillian Murphy's performance was great and the fact that many known actors take part in the movie, (most of them you may recognize as you watch this movie), I simply think that the length of this movie is a huge gamechanger. Personally i have a short attention span and i found that the story doesn't captivate you enough to keep you entertained throughout the movie. Either way i would recommend you to watch the movie so that you can understande the ""hype"" behind it. If you are someone who gets bored and distracted easily i would advise you to choose a day where you are ok with the fact that you are going to spend the whole afternoon inside a theatre."
"Wow! Nolan's best and most important film yet. Amazing timing, spot on the present sitution. Fantastic story telling. Go experience it.Finally, an experience that might wakeup people from their own personal hypnosleep, similar to a kiss-of-death alike the ""Sleeping Beauty"". Hopefully one more final reminder what a kind of weapon technology, application and scale considerations for cities on pre-emptive war using nukes in miltech defense - which is now a very close scenario going to play out with the Russians - unless both sides find a way to disarms, Nato and Russians, instead of scaling military power which means a military solution.Peace and cooperation are the way forward again - and not armaments, or an explosive (military) solution that will work. That is why these weapons was build to pre-emptively take out supply lines of people if a major war beyond a smaller asymetrical political-mixed-with-mil campaign, thus the discussions also back then on the size of cities. Only, this is not the borders of Afghanistan.I am so happy Nolan did this important story bringing perspective and closure on todays situation - going to tip either way at the final count down. Hopyfully people wake up. Including some politicians around. This story retold this way might help?On top of the story, a display of the almost now ridiculous and seemingly unending ""Mccarthy-like"" processes, which we still have to witness playing out in U. S. Super appaling and embaracing in nation, that normally go by the rule of law and democracy - and that many looked to for inspiration, now in obvious decline because of this unending farce. Worst even spreading to elsewhere. Well, systems still have many important flaws standing uncorrected. Hopefully, U. S. will become again what I remember and used to love from my childhood. M!Nolan has previously told, how important considerations on both starting and ending a story is in story telling on the film media.In this story Nolan displays very well, how chaotic and unreliable governance remains in our systems today. That the systems far from solves important problems in a god way endangering and threatening everybody. In part, because som humans still put their own access to power and own demands before the system and the peace in our (global) society. System, rules and soeciety must be improoved - upgraded from the old sh.. it is, så a peacefull enviroment for humans can carry the techologies, that we humans are now about to apply and start using on our way into the nuclear age."
"I just saw it on IMAX 70mm, I would say I have seen lots of movies in my life till now but Oppenheimer is the first FILM I have ever seen. Must be watched on IMAX 70mm (that is the way Nolan and his team made it), if that is possible (because only 30 theaters in entire world are capable to show this movie in Imax 70mm) and you do so I promise you will experience something very special that you never did and you will never forget.Its a masterpiece if I want describe it in one word, everyone's act also is super great but what Cillian Murphy did is in another level, music is also great, sounds are perfect, can't wait to watch it again."
"In a compelling fusion of biography, hisotry, and cinema, ""Oppenheimer"" proves once again that Christopher Nolan is an unwavering cinematic innovator. Dedicated to his craft and unconstrained by techonological boundaries, Nolan creates an intimate yet expansive narrative that is as explosive as the atomic bomb itself.Watching this film in 70mm IMAX is a true honor to me, just thinking about the fact that I got the chance to experience this materpiece in the greatest way makes me feel happy. From the awe-striking, grandeur of the cinematic shots to the immersive richness of each frame, the experience was as bombastic as it was beautiful.As for the story, ""Oppenheimer"" beautifully marries fact with fascination. Although biographical films often struggle to balance truth with intrigue, Nolan have transformed a piece of history into a compelling narriative that remains respectful to the facts while never losing sight of the need to entertain.The performaces in this film are nothing short or remarkable, and none more so than Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Murphy conveys a spectrum of emotions that are as nuanced as they are powerful, and his performance is a testament to the art of screen acting. Through his vivid embodiment of Oppenheimer, Murphy invites us into the physicist's mind, allowing us to share in his excitiment, his struggles, triumphs, and ultimately, his burden. His performance elevates this film to the realm of cinematic masterpieces."
Only Nolan can do this mix. When you talk about the atomic bomb and explain the complex physics of it's manufacturing in a such a simple way you have to be Christopher Nolan. But actually the movie is not about the bomb it's about the era of the world war and specifically the scientists and the conflict they suffered when one of the most revolutionary inventions turns into a lethal weapon that will kill hundreds of thousands or more. With the outstanding performance of cillian murphy as usual and the magnificent cast in every single role. The most surprising was Robert Downey Jr he was on fire the best role in his entire career so far. To sum up it's the perfect movie with the perfect director with the perfect cast with perfect soundtrack.
"It's almost as if the trajectory of Christopher Nolan's career was leading up to this film, but I don't think I was expecting ""Oppenheimer"" to leave me this moved as this very well could be the best film he's ever directed and his actual masterpiece. Being based on the book ""American Prometheus,"" we get the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer who was brought on by Lewis Strauss to helm the Manhattan Project that led to the creation of the atomic bomb but Nolan's focus was on the mam himself and not the bomb which proves to be brilliant as we get a deep and haunting character study of the aftermath and see how this action led to not only thousands of deaths in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but the guilt and weight that the ""man who moved the earth"" was forced to live with. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer proves to be the best casting choice made for this biopic as his eyes in close-ups tell you everything you need to know about what he's thinking, but in addition this brilliant actor conveys so much conviction and deep regret for all of his skeletons that you're left with a broken man who started off doing something monumental with ambitious intentions but slowly realizes what he's just actually done to the rest of the world, but Robert Downey Jr. As Strauss has my lock already for Best Supporting Actor with what could be his best career work as a man who proves to be more than an antagonist in this film."
"As I settled into the dimly lit theater, little did I know that the next few hours would be nothing short of extraordinary. The movie's captivating storyline took hold of my senses, whisking me away to a world of magic and intrigue. From the very beginning, I was hooked, unable to tear my eyes away from the screen. The plot unfolded like an intricately woven tapestry, revealing unexpected twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat. Nolan's masterful cinematography added another layer of enchantment to the already mesmerizing tale, effortlessly bringing the characters to life. Each frame was a work of art, filled with breathtaking visuals that left me in awe. As the credits rolled, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the unique experience I had just witnessed, one that would undoubtedly stay with me as a cherished memory."
"I try not to buy into hype. Rarely does a movie exceed high expectations. The Barbenheimer phenomenon basically ended in a thud for me: BARBIE was a horrendous toy commercial disguised as an existentialist statement, while OPPENHEIMER was competent Oscarbait enlivened only by a fantastic lead performance. Cillian Murphy deserves all the praise in the world for his delicate, almost Shakespearean work as the tragic Oppenheimer. He carried this movie like Atlas. The rest of the actors are great too (RDJ is a great antagonist). The visuals are fantastic, with Nolan using shallow depth of field to give the sense that the protagonist's world is closing in on him.However, this is otherwise just an expensive run of the mill biopic, the kind of movie designed to win Oscar gold. It doesn't take any significant risks and it tells its story in a swift fashion-- almost too swift, actually. I often felt like I was watching a clip show. The movie never drags, but it also barely breathes.Not a bad movie at all, but the kind where you leave the theater saying, ""Yeah, that was good"" while trying not to run to the bathroom."
"""Oppenheimer"" endeavors to shed light on the fascinating life of J. Robert Oppenheimer and his involvement in the creation of the atomic bomb. While the film does have its informative moments, it falls short in various aspects, leaving audiences with mixed feelings and a sense of missed potential.One of the film's strengths lies in its exceptional cast and great acting performances. Cillian Murphy, who portrays J. Robert Oppenheimer, delivers a commendable performance, capturing the complexities and inner conflicts of the renowned physicist. The supporting cast also shines in their respective roles, bringing life to the historical figures they portray.Furthermore, the film's documentary-like approach provides historical context and insights into Oppenheimer's life and achievements. The incorporation of real archival footage and interviews with experts adds credibility to the narrative, making it an informative experience for those interested in the historical events and the people involved.However, ""Oppenheimer"" struggles to find a balanced narrative between its documentary style and a conventional biopic format. The constant shifts between these two approaches create a disjointed viewing experience, making it difficult for the audience to fully engage with the story and its characters.The dialogue is another critical aspect that hindered the film's potential. The high-paced, technical jargon-heavy conversations about scientific concepts might have worked for an academic audience, but for the general moviegoer, it often felt overwhelming and alienating. This made it challenging to relate to the characters, as their personal interactions and relationships were overshadowed by these technical aspects.As a result, the character development in ""Oppenheimer"" suffered. Moments that were meant to be personal and emotionally impactful felt rushed and underdeveloped. The film's tendency to focus on the highlights of Oppenheimer's life rather than providing a more nuanced portrayal prevented the audience from connecting with him and other characters on a deeper level.Furthermore, the film's soundtrack became more of a hindrance than an asset. The attempt to create tension through overwhelming and deafening noise was not worth sacrificing the viewers' comfort. Instead of enhancing the viewing experience, the excessive use of the soundtrack became a distraction that took away from the film's potential emotional impact.Regarding the plot and historical context, ""Oppenheimer"" suffers from a lack of clear focus. The inclusion of both the bomb story and the persecution initiated by Strauss creates an unnecessarily lengthy and convoluted narrative. The prolonged subplot takes up a significant portion of the film, further detracting from the emotional resonance and leaving the audience wondering about the film's core message.Additionally, the movie's handling of the aftermath of the nuclear bombs dropped on Japan is problematic. The lack of empathy and portrayal of the devastating consequences of these weapons of mass destruction is deeply disappointing. One brief, imaginary image of a burnt corpse falls short of capturing the immense human tragedy, and the film misses an opportunity to explore the ethical implications of these events.In many ways, ""Oppenheimer"" feels like a missed opportunity, resembling a flawed version of ""The Imitation Game."" While both films deal with complex historical figures and their contributions, ""Oppenheimer"" struggles to strike the right balance, resulting in a fragmented and unsatisfying narrative.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" offers valuable historical information and, at times, feels like an educational documentary. The great cast and commendable acting performances are notable highlights. However, its failure to maintain a consistent narrative style, coupled with the overwhelming technical dialogue, underdeveloped character arcs, and problematic handling of historical events, hinder its potential to be a truly engaging and emotionally resonant biopic. For those seeking a comprehensive and immersive depiction of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life, ""Oppenheimer"" might leave them wanting more."
"The Movie, The Perfection. Nolan never disappoint us.I give Oppenheimer a 10/10 rating. It is a masterpiece of filmmaking, with stunning visuals, a gripping narrative, and an unforgettable performance from Murphy. The film is both epic in scope and intimate in its exploration of Oppenheimer's inner turmoil. It is a must-see for anyone interested in history, science, or the human condition.Here are some of the things that I loved about the film:The visuals are stunning. The film was shot on IMAX 70mm film, and the images are breath-taking. The film's use of color is also masterful, with a palette that evokes the era and the subject matter.The narrative is gripping. The film tells the story of Oppenheimer's life and work in a way that is both engaging and informative. The film does not shy away from the difficult ethical questions that Oppenheimer faced, and it does so in a way that is both thought-provoking and emotionally resonant.The performances are top-notch. Murphy gives a tour-de-force performance as Oppenheimer. He captures the scientist's brilliance, his passion, and his inner turmoil with equal measure. The supporting cast is also excellent, with standout performances from Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, and Matt Damon.Overall, Oppenheimer is a masterpiece of filmmaking. It is a must-see for anyone interested in history, science, or the human condition. I highly recommend it."
"Christopher Nolan has given us The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, and Interstellar. However, his newest film about ""The Father of the Atomic Bomb"" might just be his greatest.I have been a big fan of Nolan's work since I was a kid. I am also a history nerd, so Christopher Nolan doing a film about one of history's most significant events. Sign me up.The film is simply incredible. Cillian Murphy finally gets to lead a Nolan film and he delivers a career defining performance that will position him well for the Best Actor Oscar. Robert Downey Jr is on his way to a Supporting Actor nomination with a terrific antagonistic performance. Emily Blunt is also fantastic, especially in the film's final half hour.Oppenheimer delivers incredible Cinematography, a memorable score, and great sound. The final two hours are as good as it gets with Nolan giving us what he does best, an edge on your seat psychological thriller that you must experience in the theater. Christopher Nolan's efforts to give the audience a once and a kind theater experience exceeded the hype. I and many of his fans will hope that Oppenheimer will finally be the one that will give one of the greatest directors of his generation his long awaited Oscar glory.Oppenheimer is as of now the best film of the year and will be eventually one of the best of the decade. A memorable theatrical thrill ride that you will remember for a long time."
"In this bold and ambitious film, Cillian Murphy gives the performance of a lifetime: at times inward and nuanced, at times explosive (couldn't resist the pun) and emotional, Murphy delivers to us the man Oppenheimer, period. Being familiar as I am with some of the news photos of the real person, I sometimes wanted to gasp when Murphy donned a hat and turned his head just so. There he stood: the real Oppenheimer. And at times, it felt as if we were in the middle of The Manhattan Project- exciting, secret, frightening, full of action.But beyond that, Murphy took us on an emotional journey into something of the mental and emotional territory that Dr Oppenheimer must have inhabited, having been responsible (not solely responsible, but nevertheless responsible) for the deaths of over 220,000 people. It fell upon his soul, and we have a sense in this movie of what that may have felt like, what his own kind of intermittent PTSD may have been like, what triggered his worst flashbacks and why they were so strange. All of this psychological fabric, so to speak, of Oppenheimer's troubled mind is played out through the film and at last explained toward the end in a most moving and culminating fashion.The film itself, though, is flawed, I feel. It is extremely difficult to follow for the first hour or so, until the viewer can finally get used to all the different time periods that the director/writer, Christopher Nolan, is jumping back and forth among to tell the story of Oppenheimer's invention of the atomic bomb and subsequent accusations of being a traitor (under the guise of a denial of renewing his Classified Status) in the 1950s. Instead of telling the story in linear time, Nolan chooses to mix together scenes from both time periods (plus a few others before and after). Even a person who knows a good bit of American history from this time period like myself had a rough time getting used to this difficult narrative structure.Just a simple marker of place and date on the screen would have brought us along with Mr Nolan's shifts. As it is, I would advise a quick scan of Wikipedia's entry on Oppenheimer before watching this film, just to be able to sit back and enjoy without struggling too much to understand the grating shifts until you get used to them.Another flaw of the film is Robert Downey, Jr's performance. I have the same complaint I always have against his acting: although he is a splendid chameleon whose performances and makeup provide amazing transformations into completely new persons that sometimes cannot even be recognized (this role belonging among them), he has a habit that simply ruins every performance I have ever seen him do. He mumbles. About half of his lines are totally lost because he mumbles them, while about half of what he speaks is crisp and understandable. It's frankly deplorable. By contrast, even though Cillian Murphy speaks many lines under his breath, and even though Murphy isn't even a native American speaker (!), every word can be heard and understood easily.Another major flaw of this film, in my opinion, is that women characters do not receive much care from the writer/director or cinematographer. Perhaps the intent was to show Oppenheimer's own mistreatment of women? I don't actually think so, or rather, I do think there was an intent to portray him as a heedless womanizer who does not realize that he is hurting the women he loves, but I have to wonder if the makers of the movie- the director/writer and cinematographer in particular-- realize how little character roundness, depth, realism, even simple appeal the women in this film are afforded. It is a dilemma, I realize, since this 3-hour film is already over-long. Should his personal life be left out altogether? Should more time be given to the women so that they are not mere stick-figures? I don't know, but the present female characters are too much like caricatures to be acceptable.It is a highly intellectual film that demands much of the viewer. But it is truly worth viewing, if only to see Murphy's splendid Oscar-worthy performance, as well as Tom Conti, whose Einstein surely deserves the nod as Supporting Actor, and other notables such as Casey Affleck, Gary Oldham, and Emily Blunt."
"I already watched it twice. For the first time I watched it in regular 2d, which was already phenomenal. Then I watched it in IMAX, and I gotta say its definetly worth a watch both in IMAX and regular 2d. The movie is 3 hours long, but I felt like the story never stuck at one point and it was just brilliant. The acting is definetly on another level. Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer is just perfect. The soundtrack is definetly one of the best in the history of cinema. The Sound FX and the VFX is the best I ever saw and heard.. Christopher Nolan is amazing! This movie is definetly worth a watch."
"I always rush to the cinema to see Christopher Nolans latest films. This is the best and biggest release of the year and it really didn't disappoint. The camera work, the stills all beautiful. Didn't have the luck of seeing it in IMAX because none of the cinemas in my town support it so that was disappointing for myself. Really have to pay careful attention to what is going on, the pacing was constant but tells a great story. The reference to JFK at the end I really appreciated after watching Kevin Costners masterpiece recently. Nolan said that he took inspiration from that film and Lawrence of Arabia, heroine turned to villain and victimised summed up Oppenheimer just like those films. Definitely got my moneys worth today. Go see it!!"
"In the forces of nature, duality exists. This law governs our humanity. It is the catalyst by which we create...and by which we destroy.Nolan explores this theme sub-atomically as we enter the mind of our protagonist and the ambition of our antagonist. While we might believe we are witnessing man harness the power of the sun, instead we are witnessing the creation of an equally devastating power - the fallout, the shadows of governance that would usher us into a nuclear winter.Fusion is created. Both light and darkness burst forth. Can humankind be trusted with this power? Have we as a species reached enlightenment? Or will we repeat Eden? Repeat Babel? Is our reach for divinity the beginning of our fall yet again...These questions are explored in profound ways. And they are answered with gut-wrenching truth. This work is courageous in that sense - that it does not yield to the desires of man and our ambition, but instead reveals our very nature thereby delivering an existential truth.Let Nolan's film be praised not as a film, but as a message to the world. Prophetic in its delivery, it foretells of what will come if we continue the current course. It's important that we all take heed of this truth and use it to build a better world - before our power consumes it."
"This story needed to be told to the world, and this delivery was perfect. I'm still unpacking it in my head. Was Oppenheimer a villain or a hero? I hated him, was proud of him, happy for him, mad, crushed, elated, and many other emotions. His work changed the world and directly led to our current reality. The human element of progress often comes at a price, and those responsible must live with the results both good and bad.This movie immediately goes into my personal Top 5. The acting, effects, sounds, visual presentation, storyline ... Everything about this movie was spectacular. I was completely riveted. My two, young adult sons watched with me and were likewise impressed."
"Best movie of recent times. It's good because it tells a very important character in history but best explained. I've watched a lot of Bibliographies but this one would be really hard, the best Bibliography ever. Especially the Atomic bomb scene impressed me, I froze on the stage and I really loved the scene. I'm sad I didn't have the opportunity to watch imax but it was awesome even in classic form. If you like science fiction, If WW2 interests you and if you're wondering what is the death that destroys of the worlds. Definitely don't miss this 3-hour bibliography of Oppenheimer, the father of the Atomic Bomb."
"Acting was fabulous. Choice of film stock and the way it was filmed also. But (and this is quite a big but), a lot of the scenes were out of focus. Especially the IMAX 70mm shots. It was so distracting to a point that I went looking for focus points (oh look, the ear is in focus). I know Nolan doesn't 're-shoot' but it felt sloppy work.As a Dutch person, I also feel slightly offended that there wasn't even an attempt at Dutch. I don't know what that was, but it was certainly not Dutch. Those sloppy things annoy me when a film is so raved about.Maybe a bit too much hype around Nolan?Stunning cast and a great performance overall, but it's a long way sitting through (3hr) with a bit of a boringness to it."
"This movie takes a very interesting story and turns it into absolute boring garbage. If you dare say that, the pseudo intellectuals will call you a dullard, and claim that you don't know anything about the Manhattan project. Read a book on the subject, you will garner more knowledge and excitement than this film could ever provide. This is hands down the biggest disappointment of a movie in years, and I am usually a fan of Nolan. This film touched on none of the interesting aspects of this subject. No mention of the demon core, no mention of the science and knowledge it took to make any of this happen, no mention of the ethical and moral implications and consequences most scientists felt. This film drags on for hours while never deserving to do so. Anyone who says they like this movie is a phony intellectual neckbeard."
"Oppenheimer is directed by Christopher Nolan and features an absolutely massive cast including Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Matt Damon and many more.I'm sure nearly everyone knows already, but the movie is about the father of the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer and the story is based on the 2005 biography titled American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer.As someone who considers himself a Nolan fanboy, I was left feeling a little disappointed after his last two efforts (Tenet, which was just a bit messy from start to finish and Dunkirk, which while a masterclass in filmmaking didn't let me get to know any of the characters). However, I'm relieved to say that Oppenheimer is a return to form for the modern filmmaking master, as I thoroughly enjoyed nearly every minute of this 3-hour epic. Also, the sound mixing is much improved from Tenet, although there wasn't as many other sound effects in this film which made it easier to hear the dialogue.Admittedly, some of the heavy lifting is already done for Nolan here as the story is based on a Pulitzer Prize winning biography about the man who played a large role in creating the world's first nuclear bomb, but where Nolan's considerable talents come into play is the way in which he condenses 700+ pages and flawlessly translates it into a 3-hour movie without losing any of the drama, ingenuity, innovation, astonishment or horror. Perhaps most importantly though, it's the story of one of history's most important men at both his best and worst, and with a lesser director at the helm this likely would've been lost for the sake of more commercially viable elements.It's for this reason that the performances in this movie carry so much more weight than usual, because all of the emotional beats are delivered through the actors' faces and body language, and it's completely fair to say that the performances are outstanding across the board. For this reason I won't cover each and every one, but I must briefly elaborate on both Robert Downey Jr's and Cillian Murphy's.The fact that Downey Jr never has to work again but will still show up for a small part and give a performance that leaves you wondering, 'is this his best performance?', is a testament to the man's passion for his craft. The way in which he portrays Lewis Strauss' shift from a cunning man in control to a desperate and jealous fool is masterful.In regard to Murphy, if you've been watching his performances for the last few decades the fact that he's brilliant here won't come as a surprise, but I don't think you've seen him in a role as dynamic as J. Robert Oppenheimer. His performance circles from fish out of water, to brilliant scientist, to leader of men, to proud innovator, to shamed exile and finally, to horrified creator, and every single one of these transitions is delivered so subtly that it doesn't all hit you until the final moments of the film.It won't be a surprise if Oppenheimer is nominated for any or all of the 'best movie', 'best director', 'best actor' and 'best supporting actor' categories at the next Oscars, but I will eat my shorts if Murphy isn't at least nominated for 'best actor'. By my view he'd be one of the most deserving winners of all time.All of this to say that regardless of how well-written the dialogue is, this movie is a lot of people talking in rooms and if you're someone like me who enjoys science, history and politics then you're going to love Oppenheimer, but I would understand if someone said this movie wasn't for them. That being said, I think most people can relate when I say that watching what humanity is capable of is both truly astonishing and incredibly terrifying, and on that front Oppenheimer succeeds like few movies before it."
"If you see one film this year, or this decade, let it be Oppenheimer. This is one of the greatest films of all of history. This is a deep film too. I am broke, taking money out of my IRA to pay a bit off of the credit cards in order to see this movie. I needed to see this film opening day in IMAX. I am glad I did. Very important film. It is rated R, but I would still recommend you see this movie with your older children supervised. That is if they are well behaved. This is a movie that you don't take a restroom break halfway during. Go before. Don't buy a large soda and popcorn. I never do anyway. But I sometimes buy a double Jack and Coke at AMC Theatres. But this film I decided not to get a drink. No distractions."
I saw many movies during my life but not one was for me good enough to write an Imbd review. This movie has everything a good movie must have and even more than that. It is a biopic as great as it could be and mostly even historically correct. But for me a citizen of Eastern Europe it also has an essence of understanding of the great danger that the atomic bomb is. The movie uses no CGI and show real explositions of bombs and it is better than what any CGI could make. It is also very philosophical in its thinking about the threat that the bombs make. But most importantly the actors from the main Cillian Murphy to others like Emily Blunt and Robert Downey jr. Are all just as wonderful as they could be. This movie is a masterpiece and a must-see.
"Other then interstellar and inception, I can genuinely say this is one of his best movies hes made so far. The amount of detail put into the movie was amazing and I love the film/editing effects he did to convey or portray a setting or time or place. It was a long movie, 180 minutes of runtime but honestly when it was over I turned to the person I was with and told them I wanted to see it again and they said the same thing. Also we couldn't help whisper to each other at parts because sometimes i can be a little tough to follow with all the historical figures. Would recommended everyone go and see it to see the dilemma he lived with. He did the right thing but he also created a much dangerous world."
"I liked the film and thought it was a very good film. Christopher Nolan once again proves his mastery in storytelling and soundtrack, creating a thought-provoking and visually stunning cinematic experience with a beautiful soundtrack. However, it is essential to note that this film might not appeal to everyone and is more suited for a specific audience.Clocking in at around 3 hours, one might expect a daunting experience, but surprisingly, the time seemed to fly by. While my movie theatre fortunately did take a short movie break, the film's fast-paced nature kept me engrossed throughout. And at the right moments, the films was at a somewhat slow pace. Nolan has a unique way of weaving complex narratives that demand attention and concentration, making sure the audience is captivated throughout the entire duration.One of the film's standout features is its non-chronological order. The films jumps between different timelines, allowing the audience to piece together the story's puzzle as it unfolds. This approach adds an extra layer of intrigue which kept me even more engaged, trying to connect the dots between the various events.However, no film is without its flaws, and Oppenheimer has one notable mistake (it didn't affect the overall storyline however). During a scene in Leiden in the Netherlands, the characters were meant to be speaking Dutch, but instead, they spoke German. I am not sure how this is in the end result, definitely with a Dutch cameraman who filmed this movie who would definitely take notice of this flaw.Oppenheimer is a remarkable film that delves into complex themes and historical events, making it ideal for history enthusiasts and fans of intellectually stimulating cinema. With its mesmerizing storytelling, it may not be universally appealing, but for those willing to embrace its intricacies, it offers an unforgettable and satisfying cinematic experience."
"""Oppenheimer"" is not simply a tale of the most prominentt physicist during World War II; it is a portrayal of America's past, present, and future. Skillfully illustrating the ideological divisions between the left (communists) and the right (loyal Americans), the movie reminds us that history not only recounts the past but also explains our present.Christopher Nolan once again demonstrates his prowess in filmmaking, proving that quality cinema thrives in 2023.The film weaves together two narratives. Firstly, it delves into how humanity attained its tremendous power. Secondly, it examines the consequential aftermath of wielding such power.Cillian Murphy delivers an outstanding performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer, potentially defining his legacy as an actor. Oppenheimer is portrayed as a complex man, flawed like any ordinary mortal, yet gifted with a profound understanding of the quantum world. This brilliance is visually depicted on screen with impressive execution.The movie also unveils Oppenheimer's political struggle, torn between his communist sympathies and the need to protect his fellow Jews from annihilation.Robert Downey Jr.'s performance as Lewis Strauss is equally praiseworthy, dispelling any doubts about his ability to move beyond the iconic Iron Man role. Though his screen time is brief, Downey Jr.'s impact is undeniable.The sound design plays a significant role, becoming almost a cast member, effortlessly guiding the audience through various emotions and settings. The accompanying score complements the sound seamlessly.Every actor and actress involved in the film possess impressive resumes, reflecting Nolan's esteemed reputation in the industry. The performances are all top-notch and reflect the director's respect for the craft.""Oppenheimer"" pushes the audience to question our morality and our ego. It ignites discussions about the consequences of humanity's tendency to exploit scientific advancements to the detriment of others, rather than seeking collective benefits.However, it's important to note that the movie might disappoint those anticipating a fast-paced story about the bomb. While the backdrop is Trinity and the A-Bomb, the film primarily revolves around thoughtful dialogue and a cerebral narrative as it pertains to the work and accomplishments of Robert Oppenheimer.Emotional resonance takes a backseat to intellectual engagement, which may not hit home with every moviegoer. Nevertheless, this focus on biography and thoughtful exploration serves the film's purpose.Technically, the movie excels in every aspect, earning it the status of a phenomenal creation. Yet, it falls short of reaching its full potential, as the writing leans heavily towards the biographical elements, rather than the imaginative aspects that elevate such films.Assigning a definite rating feels premature; repeated viewings might influence one's perspective. As a preliminary review, I would rate it 8.8/10 for now, with the possibility of revision in the future.Ultimately, ""Oppenheimer"" presents an enriching cinematic experience that warrants a visit to the IMAX theatre for anyone intrigued by the topic. It encourages introspection and instigates discussions, making it a movie that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll."
"I'm still trying to digest what this film was, I was paralyzed for 5 minutes as the credits rolled. I can barely describe the contribution to the history of cinema that Christopher Nolan has just made.Cillian Murphy was truly magnificent in his role as J. Oppenheimer, the photography so powerful, every detail, every sound. A splendid work that only Nolan could have done with such tenderness, cinema is not dead! It's been years since I was so enchanted by a production, honestly, I could watch this film in the cinema over and over again.I would like to say a thousand things, but I just can't, guys... just watch this masterpiece!"
"I'm 77 saw this with my 20 year old sun; we haven't discussed this yet because I have to wade through the details, and my hearing is what it was so I will have to revisit when it hits cable. But I do remember the aftermath of much of the happenings here; a long passed away friend who was in the Navy during WWII made a remark during a club meeting where Memorial Day, the 4th of July or another patriotic date was current. He stated that it was clear had we not dropped the bomb, that the carnage in Japan would have been unspeakably abhorrent. It would have been door to door, and person to person. Also Japan dropped Pearl Harbor on us at a time when our entry was not at all inevitable. What struck me what how so little has changed in (in)human nature, especially in politics in general and DC in particular. As an aside, I noticed that ""James Woods"" was an executive producer; there happens to be another James Woods with IMDB and I was pleased that IMDB shows it was the same James Woods whose roles I have enjoyed for so long. I know that as of January 2, 2023, he has not been hired for an acting job since a voice gig since a voice acting job in 2019 due to his outspoken conservative views. Kudos to him. He may have empathized with Dr. Oppenheimer. Welcome back."
"As a fan of Nolan I was really looking forward to this film. And while I didn't dislike it, I just expected so much more about the making of the Atomic bomb than the movie actually gives us. In both 2 minute trailers, we are treated to an intense pressure cooker of the race to build the first nuclear weapon to avoid having it used on us by the Nazi's. The trailers spend about 99% of their time focused on this one tremendous achievement, and the implications that it would bring to the world, both good and bad.The movie was something entirely different. The acting was suberb. The score was excellent. But the subject matter wasn't exactly what was promised in the trailers. Again, I am a fan of Nolan. But I'm a bit disappointed with the build up the trailers promised as it did not accurately portray what the bulk of this film is about.I, like many others was hoping to be treated to a film about the physical and moral challenges the making of such a weapon would impose. But instead the vast majority of the 3 hours is spent covering the intense political aftermath that followed the war. Endless scenes of political dialogue about espionage and possible ties to Communism. I mean, I would at least hope to have left the movie about the making of an Atomic bomb with a rudimentary understanding of how such a weapon actually works. But none of that is covered in the film. There's some talk about uranium and plutonium, but that's really about it. The big scene that is built up tremendously in the trailers is pretty underwhelming to be totally honest, and lasts less than 3 minutes of the movie.With all that said, I did enjoy the film, especially the performances of Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr...but the bulk of this film is not what was advertised at all. It's more about the rise and fall of a complicated man and the ugliness of the beurocrats in Washington than the making of the Atomic bomb."
"""Very rarely go to the cinema these days - rip off candy bar, can't pause it to take a break to stretch, pee, or a smoke for smokers.But sometimes a film comes along that I believe would be worth watching on the big screen. Unfortunately, I should have waited for the reviews because when it was explained by some reviewers to be boring because it wasn't about the science but some bad men giving a genius a hard time with hearings and backroom dealings, I would have waited for the digital releases online, and then be dissappointed.Nolan also threw in some obligatory sex in there and a bit of ineffective heartstring pulling. My God, I couldn't believe how bored I was. I get that some viewers are into politics and conspiracy theories but there are thousands of people in history that could have been chosen for that type of story but Oppie had a much bigger place in history than some bad men giving him a hard time, they may as well make a film about me always being given a hard time by controlling types, but I didn't organise men to split the atom, and if I did, I would want that story told.So glad my sister and niece declined my invitation to see it, because I would have been apologising for weeks. Why Nolan thought the politics of that time and the human backstory of Oppie would be more interesting than the academic interactions of the scientists and the science problems being conquered is beyond me to understand. If I ever meet Nolan, I will just ask him, ""Oppenheimer, WTF?"""""
"It's perfect in every aspect, the greatest Nolan masterpiece to date and contender for best film of all time. Genuinely that good. Don't be surprised if they walk out with most awards for film in the next year!Cast, acting, script, pacing, cinematography, staging, effects, audio, score, everything - just perfection all around. Not to mention the historical accuracy and attention to detail. See it on the biggest screen you can manage as well, seriously worth the extra shrapnel for what it does for the experience.Nolan can't keep getting away with this. Seriously one of the best pieces of visual media I have ever seen (I know am young but I watch a lot of classics)."
"This review comes from someone who gets into the cinema with a VERY few basic facts about Oppenheimer and how he's the father of the atomic bomb. That's all I got in my brain when I got into the cinema. Im not a science physics lover and I only know two physicists in the movie and that is Neils Bohr and Albert Einstein, nothing more. And I only know the name Heisenberg from Breaking Bad shows so if you're empty headed like me when you're about to watch this movie, I gotta say go learn some of the characters in the movie first so you will not be a little confused and mixed up with the characters like me.Its a pretty fast paced movie even though its like 3 hours long so it would help a lot if you remember and know who is who to get the point of the story.So back to the reviews, Cillian Murphy played Oppenheimer so brilliantly. The visuals and graphics is great. I can feel my seat shook when the explosion happened. So kuddos to that.And as I said earlier Im having a little tough time to remember the characters and who is who in the movie so basically when it comes to the betrayal and the hearing I basically got lost. So i guess I would have to do some rewatch to actually GET it.But that didn't stop me from enjoying the ending. I think it is literally the best part of the movie. The message is so powerful and really make you feel like you got punched in the heart leaving an empty hole for you to feel it while you're walking out of the cinema. Feeling nothing but a sense of emptiness. Realizing how everything was done and there's no turning back after what Oppenheimer confessed to Einstein. What a great way to end a movie. Just the right amount of dark and a sense of chilling in everyone who's watching. Kuddos to Christopher Nolan and the casts!"
""" Oppenheimer "" is a cinematic triumph that deserves all the accolades it receives. It's a rare gem that combines artistic vision, exceptional performances, and thought-provoking storytelling into an unforgettable movie-going experience. If you're a fan of cinema that challenges and inspires, this is a film that you absolutely cannot miss. Prepare to be swept away on a journey of emotions and artistry that will leave you breathless and in awe.The cinematography and visuals are stunning, capturing the beauty of the locations and adding to the overall charm of the film. The director's artistic choices, coupled with a poignant musical score, enhance the emotional impact of key scenes, leaving an indelible impression on the audience."
"Another masterpiece of Christopher Nolan.Shocking history drama with exceptional actors performance, gorgeous photography, colours post-production and outstanding sound design that make you experience on the visceral level the feelings of the main protagonist.A story that makes you think about morality, life choices, an impact genius life-work and historical political regimes where our parents or grandparents lead their life.After all Batman's movies Nolan again shows that real evil is the human nature.Practicals: reserve your tickets few days ahead, pick middle seats. Make sure to visit bathroom and take snacks to this 3 hours incredible experience that you feel that time just flies. Drink a lot of water after. Remember to watch in on 70mm screen."
"Another masterpiece from the master himself, Christopher Nolan.Fascinating movie, cast, and production.With its everyone-and-the-kitchen-sink casting, alternating between color and black and white, fit-for-Imax spectacle and Ludwig Göransson's pounding musical score, Oppenheimer seeks to overwhelm the audience, an approach that works to an extent.The gorgeous visuals by DP Hoyte van Hoytema, the impeccable sound design by Richard King and the impressive editing by Jennifer Lame come together to create something stirringly grandiose yet delicately intimate.Definitely the movie of the year."
"As a firm appreciator of Nolan's filmography, but also as a huge history buff, I was very excited to see Oppenheimer, ready to relieve a similar experience to when I first watched Dunkirk.Safe to say I was surprised.Nolan's style reaches an absolute apogee in this movie, combining short and longe sequences, flashbacks and visions to create the perfect illusion of action, despite the actual slow pace of the story.The movie is intense, stunning visually and aesthetically, always creating an epic, almost ""you are living it"" type of atmosphere. Despite all of this, it is quite accurate from an historical standpoint, thus combining action with documentary.I spent the entire 3 hours on the edge of my seat, as the picture only had a very few setbacks when it comes to rhythm.To sum it up, Oppenheimer is the type of movie that puts you in a trance. The aesthetic practically complete the story, creating an exciting atmosphere for the film's entire duration. The subject is intelligently treated, respecting history why also raising important questions about morality and loyalty that are still very valid today.For me, it was great, a must see, as everyone can find something different to appreciate about this movie."
I am waiting for this movie in 2 years and I watched it my experience is all time greatest movie ever when I watching movies and series for enjoy but you are not enjoying this movie it is a imotion for you I am pretty sure that is a Oscar winning movie. If I am director of this movie it is my greatest time to me I am proud of me but it is a one of greatest director of history Christopher Nolan movie he is a legend of unexpected and mind-blowing movie I am pretty sure all Christopher Nolan odians are watching the movie and I am saying for odians if you watch this movie you are legend thank you.
"Who was Oppenheimer? Seemingly, we see an ordinary man, a student who wants to succeed and be somebody. That his knowledge is studied even after him. To leave something to humanity that would help them develop further in the future. Fight diseases, famines, wars. Basically, what is the goal of comprehensive science? The development of civilization and its progress. Helping the individual as a human species to rise. What did J. Robert Oppenheimer with his work? He brought death. How and why? To stop more deaths. Did he regret his invention? Not at all. He enjoyed the glory, he gave new energy to humanity. That can help. Tomorrow that weapon can be used to deflect an asteroid that would destroy us. He regrets that he placed his child in the hands of those who did not use that knowledge for the benefit of humanity. To the powerful, for whom human lives are just numbers, and those who realized what they had done are - cry-baby, as one character said. Here, in addition to all that, we see a classic biographical film. Very well woven, with a few flaws. Some of these are the large presence of music in scenes, where it is placed in scenes where someone is talking. It is constantly heard. When characters like the main one are walking, they enter the room and music is there. No need. That's what wasn't needed on that scale. Another minus is that the start is a bit slow. Not meeting him at the university, which was really cool, but all that getting into the story around the Manhattan Project. I get the impression that Nolan did this on purpose to inflate the film to a three-hour running time. Like the old epic classics. But this film, when compared to today's commercials that overwhelm us, can comfortably be called an epic classic despite some flaws. Many singled out the absence of women as one of those. They are even in some way well depicted considering the time and the work the main characters in this story deal with. The tension is brilliantly portrayed by the anticipation of the atomic bomb test and what happens afterwards. After that, you have one scene as well as the ending itself, which can comfortably be called the best in the film. The scenes of testimony before the committee and congress are reminiscent of courtroom dramas and thrillers. Cillian Murphy rocked this role, he portrayed Oppenheimer perfectly. He might even win an Oscar. However, Robert Downey Jr. Stole the show. A great performance of his character, Strauss. I think that if he doesn't win an Oscar now, he never will. It would be completely deserved. Emily Blunt is also good in the scenes where she is represented more. She did a great job on this. Matt Damon, smarmy, brings the humor. Gary Oldman is excellent in that one scene. Rami Malek, very small role and silent. All in, a movie that you will love if you are a Nolan fan and love this genre. I can say - the best movie of the year so far.Real rating: 8.5/10
Personal impression 9.5/10."
"I must admit that I'm not a huge fan of Nolan's movies overall. I do find the subject matter (Oppenheimer and quantum physics) endlessly fascinating however and the reviews were also unanimously positive, so I got in the movie theater with decent to high expectations. Unfortunately, those expectations were not met.Minor spoilers ahead:I do acknowledge that in many respects it was a well made movie. It was beautifully shot (I watched it in the original 70mm). The acting was superb. The dialogue was oftentimes excellent (and, surprisingly for Nolan, quite audible). Even the overall dramaturgic arc and pacing was good.It would have been a very interesting biopic of a politician or war hero. But Oppenheimer was a scientist too, and a very good one at that. This is where the movie fell flat for me. It completely failed to show why quantum physics is interesting, why Oppenheimer was so good at it, and how the physics relates to the invention of the bomb.Instead, Nolan opted for a much more cliched depiction of a 'generic genius'. Expect a lot of shots of people writing quickly on chalkboard, interposed with solar flares and overly dramatic, extremely loud music. The main way Nolan tried to convey that Oppenheimer was smart, was by constantly emphasizing that Oppenheimer spoke a lot of languages and saying the words 'theoretical physics' a bunch.I understand that quantum physics is difficult, but so many interesting can be said about it. Even for the layman, things like the uncertainty principle and nuclear fission have so much story telling potential. It actually took me by surprise that so little of the science was explained or used as a rhetorical/story telling device.(I actually think the way relativity theory was used in Interstellar was vastly better.)To my utter surprise, Nolan somehow managed to make the suicide of Oppenheimer's ex-lover more engaging than nuclear fission. Of course biopics tend to really focus on the human stuff, and that side of the story was depicted decently. But it failed to tell the story of how the bomb got made and failed to shine a light on the intellectual climate of Los Alamos.The ending of the movie, where the stakes became a lot more political and a lot less scientific, was where the movie really shined. This was not enough, however, to make up for the 3 hour runtime."
Robert Downey Jr said see Oppenheimer in IMAX so I did. It cost extra to see it in IMAX so probably just a way for Nolan to make more money. Because it was not worth it. I was in row H and I kept walking up and up the stairs and it was the very top row. So I don't feel I got any benefit of seeing it in IMAX as I was that far away from the screen. The movie itself: so extremely boring. What was the point of it? To show how Oppenheimer was persecuted in the 50s over Communism? Who wasn't? Big deal. I could not wait for it to be over. It was hard to follow what was going on with so many characters. It took a lot of concentration to follow what was going on and all we wanted to see was the explosion. The only plus of this movie was seeing what was under those taped spots on the test bomb (and I'm not telling because that was the only interesting part of this movie). What a waste of 3 hours. Read all about it on Wikipedia and save your money. It's not worth it. But I am sure it will win lots of Oscar's. The boring movies always do.
"OMG..! It Took Just 57 Days And Zero VFX For Christopher Nolan To Create Another Masterpiece This Time... The Characters, The Plot, The Storyline OMG! I Just Can't Express It.. But Will Say I'm Glad That I'm Still Alive In Nolan's Era Of Making Masterpieces..! After TENET I Was Desperately Waiting For Nolan's Another Masterpiece And On July 21 My Gosh He Delivered It With OPPENHEIMER! I Usually Say To The People That To Understand Nolan's Masterpiece You Have To Watch It At least Two Times.. That's Not Complain That's The Compliment Of Nolan's Artwork..! Moreover The Cast Was Iconic.. Will Just Say Go And Watch It..!#Oppenheimer💥"
"I think this was my best experience in the cinema in a very long time. I had the chance of watching it on 70mm and it was really staggering. I admire the team for making such a film about one of the most sensitive and important stories to be told. As a filmmaker myself; i know how exciting it is to make a film about true events and i know this are the hardest stories to tell. Moreover, the background score was beautifully done, it really achieved the emotional impact it was intended to put upon the audience, great score. I didn't expect nudity in a Nolan film,but i understand it was necessary to tell the story in a more sophisticated and realistic way.This is a film i'm considering 10/10 in a first watch.I recommend the viewer to watch this Great Motion Picture."
"Nolan has succeeded to create a different cinematic expirience. An unconventional one.It is the new definition of a SPECTACLE. I was just hooked for 3 hours.It's caused me to feel a lot of different feelings. But at the end of it, I was just speechless.My friends were all talking about what they liked or didn't like, and then they asked me what I think about it, and all I could say is ""I don't know""I'm relatively new Nolan fan, so I feel greatfull to get to see a true Nolan spectacle in cinema.I've seen TENET in cinema, and liked it a lot. But it's just not the same thing.Than you Nolan."
"I may consider myself lucky to be alive to watch Christopher Nolan
Works which get better by years.Oppenheimer is - with no doubt- going to be one of the best movies in the history. Amazing cinematography, Exceptional acting and terrifying Soundtracks.All the cast are great from cilian Murphy who is going for the oscar with this role to Rupert Downey jr and Emily blunt and finally rami malik who has small scenes but you will never forget them.I didn't watch it in Imax as i couldn't wait and ran to the nearest cinema but now i will sure book an imax ticket.Don't waste any time, book your ticket and Go watch it.. NOW."
"This film is more than an achievement. It's ambitious, it's near flawless, and it's very gripping. The humanity Cillian Murphy and cast-mates bring to these characters is very rarely seen in film today. It was like you're there with these people taking part in everything that is happening on screen. From the hearings, the classrooms, the labs, and all the way to the Trinity Test itself, it feels like you're there. When that bomb drops, you feel the instant regret and fear that it brought to Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists. This film has a lot of clear love and respect put into it. The practical effects feel more real than ever before and the tension never stops. Not even for a second. You will not leave this film feeling the same as you did when you first sit down. That's a promise."
"The life and times of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist and central figure of the Manhattan Project, have always fascinated me. Needless to say, the movie surpassed all my expectations and left me absolutely awe-struck.The casting was impeccable, and the performances were nothing short of extraordinary. The lead actor portrayed Oppenheimer with such depth and authenticity that I felt emotionally connected to the character throughout the film. The supporting cast also delivered stellar performances, bringing to life the complex web of relationships that shaped Oppenheimer's journey.The visuals were simply breathtaking, and the attention to detail in recreating the historical settings was commendable. From the vast landscapes of Los Alamos to the intense laboratories where groundbreaking scientific discoveries were made, the movie's visual representation was captivating.The story was masterfully woven, taking us on a rollercoaster of emotions as we witnessed Oppenheimer's struggles, triumphs, and personal conflicts. The film delved into the moral dilemmas faced by scientists during World War II, raising thought-provoking questions about the ethics of scientific advancement during times of conflict.However, I do have one minor critique. As the movie approached its climax, I expected to see the portrayal of the Hiroshima bombing and its aftermath. Given the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and the world, I felt its omission was a missed opportunity to provide a more comprehensive view of the consequences of his work. Nevertheless, I understand that storytelling decisions are often complex, and the focus of the film may have been on exploring Oppenheimer's character rather than the historical events in their entirety.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic masterpiece that expertly weaves together the brilliance of science and the intricacies of human nature. It is a gripping tale that delves deep into the mind of a scientific genius while challenging the audience's perceptions of war and its consequences. Despite the absence of the Hiroshima bombing scene, the movie's overall brilliance overshadows this minor flaw. I highly recommend ""Oppenheimer"" to anyone who appreciates exceptional storytelling and outstanding performances. This movie will leave you with a newfound appreciation for the complexities of the human spirit and the weight of scientific discovery."
"Oppenheimer delivers on its expectations, though in a different way than I was expecting.I was expecting a film similar to another Nolan treasure like Interstellar. A deep story packed with progression and constant adventure. Instead, I was greeted with a layered, politically dramatic storyline that gave way to its character development rather than solving problems.I came into the film completely blind, (besides an in cinema trailer that I couldn't miss). I was also able to see it at Arizona Mills IMAX in genuine 70mm film format. This (in my opinion) must be the greatest way to experience a film like this.Oppenheimer delivers an onslaught of dialogue throughout its entire runtime. Make sure to come into this film very prepared.This film falls short of Interstellar for most of its runtime, even dragging a bit right after the nuclear fission test. The film picks up in a way I never expected in its final sequence.Masterpiece."
"A little different from previous work of Christopher Nolan. Every single actor is perfect in their places. Murphy and Downey are nailed their character's.The movie captures you inside Oppenheimer's brain from starting you can feel what he feels at every single moment.Background score is on point specially in the scenes of Trinity test and quantam mechanism
Conversation in between Oppenheimer and Einstein in the climax about the world end leaves you stunned.Christopher Nolan is like always pushing the boundaries of cinema with Oppenheimer this time.On total a visually stunning nail biting cinematic experience."
"The movie had beautiful shots throughout the movie as well as mini storylines that kept you well entertained Even up to the three hour mark. With all the movie shorter than ever It is good to see a film that can entertain people for hours on end. The storyline that was presented in this movie was incredible and well worth every second. The soundtrack was breathtaking and amazing to see in theaters. The storytelling aspect of the movie was able to capture you the entire way. The bomb seen was beautifully done and away, not seen before in explosions. I truly great film that explores the history of the atomic bomb."
"This review contains some minor spoilers.I'll start this review by saying that I have been a huge Nolan fan for over a decade now and that every new movie of his I consider as The Movie Event of the year. However, after Chris' last picture ""Tenet"", which turned out to be a smaller letdown due to obvious signs of repeating of motives used in previous of his films, I lowered my expectations for ""Oppenheimer"" also because it is a very challenging theme to be turned into a three hour long summer blockbuster film.But even with all that in mind, ""Oppenheimer"" was a disappointing, and at certain points of the movie timeline even painful experience for me. The main cause for this is the catastrophic editing of Jennifer Lame who started her collaboration with Nolan on ""Tenet"" and actually did a decent job there. In ""Oppenheimer"", on the other side, the scenes and shots are exchanging so quickly you get to think the movie has only one hour to tell the story rather than three. This especially comes to expression within the first forty minutes or so of the film where we don't even get a brake to think and relax for a second, the movie just keeps changing and going from scene to scene with each scene lasting approximately five to ten seconds (and that is not an exaggeration). Nolan never really used to implement long shots or scenes in his movies, but this was just another level of short shots intertwined with each other.Another problem is the poor use of soundtrack. This movie has no action at all, it is a drama that could well be performed on an actual stage, so having loud music in the background during scenes in which two characters have a tense, long dialog in order to emphasize that tension, really brings these same scenes to the level of ridicule. Speaking of soundtrack, Ludwig Göransson did a fine job here, but he tries way too much to be Hans Zimmer.I also have a problem with the script itself. Like, why do we have two narration lines in this film? One line is Oppenheimer hearing intended to remove his security clearance, shot in color, and the other is Senate confirmation hearing of Lewis Strauss (played by Robert Downey Jr) to become Secretary of Commerce, shot in black and white. At the end of the movie they come together and the black and white line transfers to color, which seems to be an hommage to Nolan's second film ""Memento"", but other than that I don't see any purpose in having those two hearings tell us the story in parallel.There are things that save the film from being a complete catastrophe, first and foremost the performances. I mean, when you have an ensemble cast of over twenty known actors, five of which who are Oscar winners, than you don't expect anything less. There are also some scenes that are very well made. The famous Trinity test scene where they set the bomb for the first time is well delivered, but I would also advise not to expect too much because it's not all that impressive. The ending is also neat, and there are a few more scenes that save the experience and are well made mostly thanks to the cinematography of Hoyte van Hoytema, which, again, is decent but not all that impressive like in ""Dunkirk"" for example.All things considered, ""Oppenheimer"" is nowhere near bad as it is disappointing, but Nolan has accustomed us to a higher standard, a that's why a 6/10 is a very low rating for a director and writer of his caliber. I can see that the audience and the critics went crazy about this film, given the fact that its metascore is at 89/100 (highest ever for a Nolan film after Dunkirk) and IMDB rating 8.8 at the time I'm writing this review, and it wouldn't even surprise me him finally winning an Oscar for this. How ironic would that be? He didn't get one for ""Memento"", as he should, for the ""Prestige"" and ""The Dark Knight"" he wasn't even nominated, and yet something tells me he will finally get one for ""Oppenheimer"", possibly the worst movie he ever made."
"Knowing Nolan's skills, I expected an excellent film firmly grounded in history. Unfortunately, this film watches like a transcript of conversations on Teams. It's boring, overdone and chaotic. The timelines intertwine so that you can't figure out what times you are watching. We watch characters talk to each other and discuss what others have said. Oppenheimer himself has been made into a slightly crazy type who basically doesn't know why he is working on the atomic bomb. I still don't know what his motivation was, it was so hard to tell from the acting. Well, that's right, the acting. With so many excellent actors, Nolan gives us such flat and poorly drawn characters. Oppenheimer's wives, in particular, look like characters artificially glued to the plot. They might as well not have been there and the film would have lost nothing and gained nothing. Unfortunately, I will not recommend this film. It is probably the worst Nolan film I have seen."
"The elements of our universe are truly miraculous. Tremendous insightful masterpiece.Cillian is Outstanding, Excellent, Robert is exceptional, Emily is always good, and Matt is great no matter what role he plays.Physicists and Scientists are remarkable in their intelligence, education, and understanding, in their pursuit to reveal the wonders of our world.Human intelligence, given to us by God, is given as a gift, to allow us to discover the unfathomable depth of our World. Our human intelligence is given for our use.When intelligence is used for understanding, wisdom and good, we have used it as it was intended. In the battle of good vs evil, sometimes it must be used so good prevails, and souls survive."
"Best movie of 2023 for me -I have watched the movie three times as of August 3rd. I have learned something different and powerful each screening!Christopher Nolan has a very dramatic tone and score to his movies, but I have not been on board with his recent films until NOW.The cast is well hearsed. The music is deep. The story is mind blowing + revelationable.IMAX has not been my preference for movie formats in a hot minute, but Oppenheimer had an amazing effect in IMAX.Much more intriguing than Barbie, which is the current friendly competing film at the box office.THANK YOU
CHRISTOPHER NOLAN."
"Wow where should I even start the movie began with depressing , wicked young J Robert Oppenheimer in college days in Europe, the way Nolan has captured cillian Murphy in mind boggling way at sometimes he seems careless to the consequences to his invention and sometimes the way he was so distraught with the consequences of his invention is very inventively captured the moral dilemma , geo political evolution , self discovery of Oppenheimer is not only very well portrayed by Cillian Murphy but was greatly captured by Nolan , from the very beginning the vision of atom particular that Oppenheimer sees is captured elegantly but one that got me by surprise was RDJ's Lewis Strauss or Admiral Strauss the way he was so poise , elegant almost throughout the movie then until he was not I won't reveal much but I will say his character is best describe by the Line used in movie by brilliantly played kitty wife of Oppenheimer played by Emily Blunt "" The most vindictive are the one's who has more patience"" so in last I will end this by saying that this is Christopher Nolan at his best all the actor's , crew has done fabulous job this is the movie to watch of the year."
"This was a tough one because I would consider myself a film nerd. I have been for 20+ years. So, was this film a high level of filmmaking? Yes. Was the acting in this film top notch. Yes! Was the writing, costume, set design, editing all good? Yes. I don't mind movies that are dialogue heavy. This was definitely that type. I had trouble giving this an 8, but I figured it did mostly everything great...however, just didn't captivate me like I was expecting. If I'm being honest, it felt like a 7.6 or so. Which I consider really good.The story kind of dragged on a little longer than I felt it needed. It wasn't particularly entertaining (Even though I like historical pieces and this subject matter) I just didn't get into it as much as I thought. It's like it's missing something and I haven't put my finger on it. Kind of reminds me of how I felt after the J. Edgar Hoover film.Anyways, it's worth a watch."
"Oppenheimer is a film that will stay with you long after you've seen it. It is a powerful and moving story about the creation of the atomic bomb and the man who created it. The film is visually stunning, with a stunning recreation of the atomic bomb test and emotionally powerful, with a deeply moving portrayal of Oppenheimer's inner turmoil.The film is sure to spark important conversations about the nature of war, power, and the human cost of technological advancement. It is a film that will make you think long and hard about the implications of our scientific progress.A must watch for Science and History enthusiasts."
"I had heard that this movie was ""talky"" and that it was 3 hours long so I was naturally a bit dubious when I entered the cinema. However, the moment that it actually began I was drawn in and enthralled. I did not even feel how long it was and could honestly say that I would have sat through an extra hour comfortably to have remained in Nolan's vision. It did not even occur to me during the screening to leave to go to the toilet and I only noticed that I desperately needed to go when the end credits began rolling.Every single cast member impressed me with their performance.Overall, highly recommended."
"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch."
"Whilst not a fictional sci-fi adventure epic, Nolan has turned the dial even further in this films composition, framing and pace.I feared it'd suffer a simillar issue to dunkirk where the historical events limit Nolans signature creativity but he has pulled of a 3 hour long masterpiece that at no point sits in a lul.It maintains a beautiful chaos and needless to say Murphy's performance carries a phenomenal Gravitas throughout the entire film.The sound design is haunting and horrific and viewing in IMAX brought the tension directly into my core with its loud bass and power.Going into this film blind you will most likley be awestruck by the way Nolan has driven such a compelling narrative and how the cast have been played to their best strengths to deliver a gut-wrenching performance by its conclusion."
"#minorspoileralert
It wasn't nearly in the same league as Inception or the Dark Knight. Or even interstellar or Dunkirk. I get that it's a biopic, not Sci-fi, but still... why must a movie drag for 3 hours only to show that the man who built the atomic bomb in the end had regrets and a 'conscience' -but also really, really loved his country? That ambitious unscrupulous men throw others under the bus to get to the top? Like, duh. And no, the loud incessant musical score and stellar cast doesn't make it any less boring.I get that it's Hollywood, but the subtext of these films-and this is the biggest of all-is so problematic. For a film that's more like a documentary (in its scope), and which goes at great lengths to show you how the inventor of the atomic bomb was plagued by visions of faces being peeled off we see not one Japanese face. For a scientist who was later wracked by the guilt of what he eventually did, being a scientist himself, he was very excited to achieve that end in the first 3/4th of the movie.There's much special effects and time spent on the star-bursting science and the back-breaking hard work and the deep secrecy and coordination that went into bomb: because, of course, the bomb was needed to end the war. So much, in fact, that the remorse that comes afterwards seems rather feeble. But if this was the man, then this is the film. Fine. But why then show the man in a largely positive way? And why only this man? Why this kind of film at all?#Oppenheimer goes back to that old question: do the means justify the end-even when the means here is nuclear fission and the end is The END. It succeeds in small moments, maybe, but only just.And does it really deserve all the hype? Erm, no."
"Oppenheimer is long and boring, editing is confusing mixing 3 periods, that sometimes you don't recognize, which is before which one.I was misleaded by the trailer about what would come in the movie, Robert Downey Jr is difficult to recognize at first, but is playing well as a 2nd role.I would preferably recommend to the people interested by ""Project Manhattan"", the movie ""Fat Man and Little Boy ""Les Maîtres de l'Ombre"" from Roland Joffé, which will learn you more about scientific details than ""Oppenheimer"" which is more a biopic and take too much time on political theater against communism, which much too long unuseful dialogs."
"Absolute banger by Christopher Nolan. It's just not a movie it's a sensation, the point it tries to make about chain reaction is justified by the experience you get from watching the movie. This movie frequently touches upon the fact that now mankind truly has the power to destroy itself. From stunning visuals to real like sound effects, this movie is a masterpiece of this generation.It's a pretty loaded cast with Cillian as the lead it uses his extraordinary skills to make it feel as stunning as it can get. Robert Downey also does a great job showing how good of an actor he still is. I would recommend it to anyone who wants bang for their buck in cinemas."
This film was incredibly interesting with amazing actors with Cillian Murphy taking main lead of this 3 hour film was incredible since he took kinda a lead in Peaky Blinders I knew Oppenheimer would be a success with him. Also nice sound and visual effects clear and crisp you felt as if your were in the film you felt involved lots of great knowledge especially if your a history nerd or just love a good 3 hour film this one is the one for you so this film is recommended it's a 10 out of 10 for me. Enjoy it with friends or family or even alone it quiet a film good job Christopher Nolan you definitely did well.
"Chris making a movie where Cillian is playing the leading role is something I never knew I needed. I rated this movie 10/10 even though there were things in dialogs I didn't quite catch up with or understand but just as Chris says for his films: Don't try to understand them, feel them and boy did I feel this one because my head was spinning afterwards. Though I am sure I will understand everything after a rewatch. Great movie, the cinematography was beautiful. Scenes where they zoom in Cillian's face and where we kinda see what was Oppenheimer thinking or feeling in some moments seriously made me terrified in a good way. We definitely need Cillian in more main roles in movies with a good director like Nolan and a good plot because this man deserves it. I watched many Nolan's movies and they never disappoint and this one just adds to the list. Give this man an Oscar already which he definitely doesn't need but deserves."
"The incredible layering of the film, complimented by the awesome A lister cast- straight veterans in the field to newcomers with jaw dropping talent, this movie has it all. I think Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is a strong contender for the 2024 Oscars, while Downy Jr's Lewis Strauss deserves an equally well revered nod.The direction, the camera work, the score, the strategic use of silence when required only adds to the mere brilliance of the film.This movie is going to forge its path towards a cult classic. The roles of Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek all deserve equal recognition."
"An incredible movie a one from his kind actually, the cast is incredible and I want to prise Robert Downey Jr. I saw a lot of people talks about Cillian Murphy I agree that his performance is great but Robert it's from another world I think he will get an Oscar for his performance.And finally mr Christopher Nolan will get an Oscar he gave us a movie that we will never forget look at the cast look at the story look at the Dialogue It's a 10/10 movie of course
And the sound effects oh man it's extraordinary I recommend you to watch the movie in imax screen and you will see what I am talking about."
"Even though the film is 3 hours, it seems relatively quick. People who are not very understanding of the political situation over the entire world during the II world war and the importance of what made physicists like Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg etc important are very likely going to find the movie hard to understand. But if you don't come in the category just like me, prepare to have your mind blown. (Pun intended) It's the best ensemble of actors chosen with very conscious casting by Nolan. The ""Can you hear the music"" score is going to give you chills for sure. Everyone were amazing but Cillian, Downey, Damon and Blunt stole the show."
"Cillian utterly steals the show with his performance in this narrative heavy, fast paced drama. He portrays the emotional fragility and genius of a remarkably complicated man outstandingly.The film itself is as time jumping as you come to expect from a Nolan film and you will not be alone if you feel a little lost and perplexed at points, however the film making is a masterclass in authentic genuine production and the use of IMAX for awe inspiring benefitAt times I felt the balance of volume between music and dialogue meant it difficult to understand, perhaps another watch at home will open my eyes to the story in more understanding, but don't get me wrong- this is a film you MUST see as it was intended, on as large a screen as possible.And finally, the film opened my eyes to just what a terrifying thing man created and what devastating end we could all be so close to. I'm certainly not pro UND but it does make you think a little deeper."
"Perfect Movie. All aspects. Political, social, emotional, historical everything is good. Except One scene where Bhagavad Gita quote with romantic shots. Totally disappointed.Another thing is, only theoretical aspects were shown. No single practical aspect or experiment was shown. Which was much needed.About Acting, RDJ, Murphy are exceptional actors. No personal presence of any actor. Movie takes audience bank in time. This movie is milestone and ideal for all other Directors.Unlashing every aspect of Oppenheimer as a person is phenomenal.All other things are fine. And I am waiting for another project of Nolan."
"Great news: there are none of the usually-mandatory cliche deep-penetration synth bass drum booms banging out the backing track in feeble attempt at punctuating excitement here.Less great news: this is still one of the loudest films I've been to. It's not a spoiler to report that there's a nuclear explosion in here, but that's not the noisy bit.I'm so pleased Christopher Nolan made this film. It has integrity. It tells a true story accurately. It sets its period tone perfectly. It helps me feel how it would have been there. It runs at a stunning pace for three hours even though it focuses only on person and processes, not the project. It is a biopic that navigates a thin dramatic thread between dullness and inaccessibility. Great performances are drawn from a rich cast. Intense internal moments are vividly drawn into view (often by sound). Conflicted and flawed people are seen wrestling with their demons. The arc of the man is drawn from young scientist to feted A-list former megastar. In style it is Nolan, in substance it is Oppenheimer.I'm fascinated that Nolan has achieved this despite avoiding fiction (sure some of the ideas are turned into set piece imaginatives) and despite eschewing some of the tastier material on offer, for example the extent of Oppenheimer's indiscreet promiscuity (and that of some of the other notoriously randy scientists), his mystical spiritual and metaphysical excursions, the million-person scope of the military-industrial machine needed to make all that uranium, plutonium and all the rest, and the true results of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A lot of chat has centred around Nolan tropes, but in reality it is very conventionally told (spoiler: Tristram Shandy is not a linear narrative either) albeit with great skill, and wordy enough to be the screenplay son of a stage production. I've no idea how it benefited from IMAX 70mm film or the absence of CGI: it seems like the folk that marketed the film have gone with what they thought it would be rather than what it is.I would perhaps have liked Oppenheimer to have been more fleshed out in other respects, for example to demonstrate his unexpected ability to see the big picture in complex science and engineering problem-solving, his powers of comprehension of the top physics questions of his day, his own insights and contributions to hard science (his work in the foothills of black hole discovery is hinted at), the many Nobel laureates he taught, and the duality of his open polymath/swaggering dilettante reputations. But perhaps this film is just an invitation to further discovery and discourse. It's a film that walks a delicate line that declines to peer too far into the scientific thinking of professional science thinkers.My companion tells me that there was a lot of hard concentration to do in the detail. I agree there are a lot of qualitative aspects of astro, nuclear, and quantum physics here, although most people will be pleased to know this is accomplished with Absolutely NO Equations (Ok there are some on the blackboards). I thought there were a lot of famous physicists to absorb, too: gosh - those guys were at Solvay too: amazing to think that Oppenheimer was once at University with Heisenberg, Pauli, Fermi and Dirac and all the other idea-loaded personalities just out of view, some of whom, like Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) are played almost for laughs, although Teller (Benny Safdie) is depicted carefully without caricature.Nolan chooses to tell much of the story through the lens of the process, led by Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) man Strauss (a very different, smoke-filled room operating, Robert Downey Jr), that withdrew Oppenheimer's security clearance in 1954, thus ending his career as a practising nuclear researcher. This acts as a narrative device that summarises Oppenheimer's career and places its trajectory alongside that of Einstein's, with the old man (Tom Conti) a more crumpled and humbled laureate than we often see. I enjoyed the Einstein contrast, but the AEC process places Strauss's ambition and revenge at centre stage in Oppenheimer's movie, which is not a perfect result and, like any film this long, would benefit from a sharper edit that could well focus on the 'courtroom' (AEC and Congress) scenes. Perhaps Mr Nolan needs a best mate.Cillian Murphy is marvellous throughout. Learner, thinker, teacher, lover, activist, decision-maker, director, leader, triumphalist, doubter, lobbyist, defendant, emeritus, celebrity ... he owns the sweep.One more reservation I have is that I don't sense anyone will come out of the cinema deeply moved by this. I think that's intentional, it is certainly a result of Nolan's method here: it doesn't manipulate our emotions like it could, and doesn't open us up much to self-loathing regret. If Nolan wanted this he would emote on the human story of the atrocity that was each of the bombs dropped. But he doesn't linger, and I for one preferred it this way. I don't need to wake to the horror, I've always lived it. Perhaps though, those younger than me will need the awakening, and I wonder if they will get it.Whilst with the benefit of time I doubt this will be rated a truly great movie, I do think this is as good as a historical biopic can get, has added Factor Nolan, includes the virtue of restraint, and hence overall is easily worth a 7, even if my own personal jury is out on the sound design. Those of a similar disposition should consider taking earplugs."
"What you get is talking heads saying perfect sentences, in perfect order. Basically it's a Wikipedia article converted to live action people saying it, with some effect shots sprinkled through. That way giving you assumingly lots of historical information, but zero entertainment. I would have enjoyed a voiceover much more.The dialogues are a bit like the classic Star Trek series: Impossibly perfect. But 100% informational, at a much higher pace, and with no time to breath or recapitulate. For 3 hours. It was so bad that it made me giggle at some point, probably out of misery.When I realize how much hard work has been put in by the best people in the industry, my bones start bending and my skin crumble. So much work and what do you get? A never ending inferno of talking heads, spewing informational dialogue:Bla bla bla bla *BABOOOOM!* bla bla bla blaThe BABOOM is the only cinematic moment in this movie.Everything except the BABOOM is smeared with music up to very high annoyance levels in an attempt to spice up the blablabla. Also, some sound design made no sense at all and made my eardrums bleed.This movie is totally overhyped and overrated. Don't believe the hype and just watch and old documentary or read the book if you have to."
"""Oppenheimer"" is an extraordinary cinematic masterpiece that deserves all the accolades it receives. With its captivating storytelling, brilliant direction, and impeccable performances, this movie takes us on an immersive journey into the life and mind of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. The film skillfully delves into the complexities of his character, exploring his genius, conflicts, and moral dilemmas. The attention to historical accuracy and the meticulous recreation of the era adds authenticity to the overall experience. ""Oppenheimer"" successfully blends science, history, and human emotions, leaving audiences both educated and deeply moved. It's a thought-provoking and powerful cinematic achievement that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll. A definite 10 out of 10."
"A very important movie because it tells the most important story in the history of mankind, which is the story of the nuclear bomb, but it does not tell the story of the bomb, but rather the one who invented this bomb, who is Robert Oppenheimer, who played the role of Cillian Murphy, who gave an Oscar performance And he gave us wonderful psychological acting scenes, and the other actor, Robert Downey Jr., who gave the best performance in his career, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, and all the actors performed their roles wonderfully, but the defect of this movie is that it is complicated. In explaining the nuclear bomb and during the talk of the scientists it will make you somewhat distracted and the second negative is that I was waiting for a movie by Nolan such as Interstellar or Inception, but I found myself in front of a biographical movie with the fingerprint of Christopher Nolan But I enjoyed the movie even though I expected more from this movie and it is definitely the best movie of the year so far But it includes some boredom and suffers from the long time in the elephant."
"Arguably the most coherent and character-rich of Christopher Nolan's films, Oppenheimer stands as one of the decade's best films on par with Everything Everywhere All At Once and Across The Spider-Verse.With incredible performances across the board, including a stellar portrayal of the titular physicist from Cillian Murphy, the film presents excellently the life and traumas of J. Robert Oppenheimer. As for the visuals and sound mixing, somehow Nolan wasn't exaggerating when he said the audience would feel the power of the bomb.Boasting a thought-provoking and poignant screenplay, powerful visuals, moving performances and inspired direction, Oppenheimer is a must-watch for historians and Nolan fans alike that demands your attention but delivers a groundbreaking experience."
"I think this is second or third best movie from Nolan. The non linearity in storytelling is the typical Nolan thing. If you are Nolan fan ,this movie will keep up the hype. And the acting has been exceptional. Cillian really nailed it and so rdj too. The visuals and background score makes it quite good. If you compare it with other Nolan movies you might find this weak but in this genre you can;t do much .Emily Blunt have some strong scenes. Second half is too paced and good. First half is good and slow but you might not get some stuffs if you miss those conversations in first half. I would have given 9.5 but since i m Nolan fan so i am bit biased here."
"I saw it yesterday, I'm still assimilating what I saw. All people left the theater hall so quitely without saying a word. The silence was loud.3 hours that went by fast. The light, the photography, that background music, the noise, which maintains the tension, the characters. The different narrative times that break the monotony.The American tragedy of a man pushed into the abyss of his genius as an instrument for horror and death. A terrifying psychological implosion; talent turned into salvation and, at the same time, into the worst enemy.Cillian Murphy was great.Wonderful. The movie was amazing you should definitely go see it!"
"This movie was just amazing Christopher did an amazing job as always and made yet another amazing film and cillian Murphy did a mind blowing performance definitely getting an Oscar for this I just loved Oppenheimer aftermath reaction to the bomb definitely gonna watch it like 3 times in theaters, must watch movie in a large screen. Emily, RDJ, matt did an amazing job as support characters of course nothing less all of them are amazing actors but for me personally the Batman was my fav movie but now it has to be Oppenheimer so i definitely recommend all of you to watch it and have a 3 hour experience of a life time."
"The movie:I honestly think I enjoyed the movie better on the second watch as I was a lot less confused. This movie has tons of characters and names introduced at breakneck pace which makes it somewhat hard to follow. Going into it with an understanding of how the story will unfold made it much easier to understand. This film is honestly a pretty much flawless masterpiece and Nolans most profound and meaningful work to date.The constant intensity throughout is something I've rarely experienced in any films and is done to perfection. Cillian and supporting performances remain incredible. The visuals are impossibly beautiful and I genuinely cannot fathom how he managed to make them without CGI unless he is lying. The non-linear aspect of this film is the best Nolan has ever done it other than maybe Memento. The ending of this film is perfect, and without it I don't think I could score it nearly as high.The experience:Nothing can ever top the experience of seeing this opening day in IMAX with perfect seats, but this came close. This viewing was 70mm (not IMAX) but my first movie viewed on actual film, which was very cool."
"Oppenheimer is without a doubt the best movies of the year. Not only is it the best movies of the year but it is one of the greatest movies of all time. This movie is a cinematic masterpiece with breathtaking visuals and sound design. It is a 3 hour rode that flies by very quickly. Bot a single second is wasted, every moment serves a purpose. This movie also has excellent performances throughout especially when it comes to Robert Downey Jr and Cillian Murphy. The side characters are also incredible. Oppenheimer is not only a biopic, it is also a character study that goes deep like the likes of taxi driver. It allows you to explore oppenheimer and his thinking in a very detailed way. Nolan has done it again! 10/10."
"I had anticipated a more straightforward, character-driven study of the man who helped to develop the atomic bomb, but instead, I was met with a 3-hour long summer blockbuster and a possibility of hearing loss.Thinking about this, I feel guilty for not understanding Nolan's summer films since I've seen all of them except Memento. Now it is clearer that this (Oppenheimer) is exactly what I should've expected, but for some reason, I didn't.So now, understanding that I went to see it with a wrong impression or a misunderstanding of the director's style, I'll give my two cents on this one.The film's editing was particularly problematic. The director is known for his use of quick cuts and jarring transitions, but in Oppenheimer, this style felt overused and gratuitous. The film's many plot threads were constantly being cut away from, making it difficult to follow the narrative up until the very end. Not much complaining can be done after Tenet and Dunkirk, but again, I expected something different for a bio-drama.The sound mixing was also poor, with the dialogue often being drowned out by the music. This was especially frustrating during the film's tensest moments when I was desperate to hear what the characters were saying. Again, this was my IMAX experience. Maybe yours will be different.Another problem is that there's just too much story. Oppenheimer wasn't a short film by no means, the creators wanted to make a deep dive into the political and historical background of some of the major characters, and there were so many of them. I don't think making this a solo film was a good idea, but a Chornobyl-style mini-series - would've worked great. They had so many good actors, but they were forced to fly through the scenes on an airplane bomber since they were limited by the runtime.Despite these flaws, there were many redeeming qualities to Oppenheimer. The film's performances were all excellent, much so I cannot single out a particular one. The film's visuals were also stunning, with Nolan's trademark use of IMAX cinematography creating some truly awe-inspiring images. The soundtrack was plain gorgeous, and very memorable. Too bad that it was mixed into scenes where it shouldn't have been, and it also had some weird cuts, almost like clipping, ruining the tone. Like it was artificially cloned and stretched. Maybe I'm making this up.Ultimately, Oppenheimer is a film that is both ambitious and flawed. It is a film that attempts to grapple with the weighty subject matter of the atomic bomb, but it ultimately fails to do so satisfyingly for me. I would recommend watching the film at home, where you can adjust the volume and take breaks as needed.P. S. I also want to thank the creators for finally giving me an understanding of what to expect, and saving me from later disappointments."
"Oppenheimer is a historical drama delivered by one of the best directors of his times, Christopher Nolan.The movie is a spot on drama, with a difficult story to handle, especially in an age when a nuclear threat isn't that far fetched. Hence, the movie's topic often gets uncomfortable to watch, especially when you watch everyone in an ectatic mood over their success, when you know the outcome of that success. And yet, the movie often opts to turn into a courtroom drama, with the timelines overlaping and everything coming together in the end.Hence, the movie often gets confusing as to what timeline you are on and its not easy to follow. It is also way too long, neary three hours running time, which isn't easy to commit to, especially during summer, which is the movie's release date.On the other hand, Cillian Murphy finally gets the lead in a Nolan movie and proves once again how talented he is. But, Robert Downey Jr is simply excellent in this one, nearly unrecognizable! The rest of the stellar cast did a good job as well."
"Oppenheimer, directed by Christopher Nolan, is a masterpiece of a character study, building up suspense and most importantly dread like no movie I have ever seen. What I found so particularly amazing about it is the fact that you know what's coming, you know what the titular man and character releases and yet the buildup to that faithful test keep you on the edge of the seat.Now, before you go into the movie you have to get one thing clear: this movie is not about the Trinity nuclear test, nor the bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. It is, as stated by the title, about Oppenheimer. It's about him, his problems, his actions and the consequences of those actions. We see most of the movie through Oppenheimer's perspective, how he interprets and feels about the events taking place and I've seen one too many people complain about a few scenes because they simply did not understand this.Lastly I want to bring up the editing, it's sublime but not easy to follow. The movie jumps back and forth through time periods, being almost reminiscent of a documentary in terms of it's structure and it respects the audience enough to let us piece all of it together ourselves. This means that you actually have to sit down, listen and think about what is being said and what is happening.In short, this is the best movie released in quite some time and should be enjoyed by everyone who enjoys a good film. Watch it on the biggest screen you can and enjoy the experience of watching one of the greatest movies ever made.9/10, simply a masterpiece."

VFX/CGI:⭐⭐⭐⭐The curse of Oppenheimer is a fascinating subject from his begging of, that no one could quite understand what was running through his mind. But I believe that this one film might be the closest source that we can get to the mind Robert Oppenheimer. It's the best film I have watched this year. I will have to admit I have seen some of his movies like Interstellar, Tenet and Inception I am saddened to say I haven't seen any of the batman film (thanks streaming services)Although I will never agree with having music in the way of voices lines (more on that later), I respect and will always respect Christopher Nolan's choice of story's and cinematography.Every scene in that film looked amazing, especially with the perspective shift between what Lewis Strauss Played by Robert Downey Jr, and J. Robert Oppenheimer played Cillian Murphy represented by the B&W colour shift.I exactly loved the B-roll like scenes of what Oppenheimer is dreaming ofThe soundtrack sounds fantastic with, the suspense & cinematic perspective it brings. Nolan has once again expertly opened us to a film where we cannot hear important voice lines, admittedly the music to speech ratio was a lot better, but personally I see music in a film as a tool to assist actors, directors and editors to bring out the feeling that the film should bring. But with this film I found that the music got carried away, always playing in scenes that it was either unnecessary or too distracting. I did feel towards the beginning of the film that the music was constant, but I later learned that that was for a reason, because if we didn't have constant sound, the sound of the nuke wouldn't be as impactful.Unlike the music, I was really impressed by the use of sound to emphasize a point ad show what J. Robert Oppenheimer mental deterioration was like. I especially liked the thunder like sound effect that kept repeating over and over again anytime Oppenheimer was fearing the future effect his work will have, but was better than the set-up was to reveal. It wasn't the sound of atoms smashing, it wasn't even anything to do with the bomb, it was us. The thing that Robert Feared the most was the new power he just gave to every single powerful person out thereWith the actors, all I can believe is that there was a door that said ""Christopher Nolan Oppenheimer, apply here"" with a huge Cue outside, because that was no shortage of famous faces that all fit in to their role perfectly. Honestly, after looking more into the atomic bomb team, you realize that quite a lot of the cast just look like that original people. There is too much to talk about when it comes to this film and the exaggerated with the cast, so let's pick my top 3:**Cillian Murphy:**
There are a few actors that I would just watch anything that they're in, and Cillian Murphy is one of them. He is a superb actor that put everything he has got into the role. I will admit the first thing I saw him was peaky blinder, but since then I have had to check every other production he has been in.**Robert Downey Jr:**
Robber Downey Jr seems to fit roles where he has to be the one in power, in this film he did a wonderful job emphasizing the world that Lewis Strauss was going thought and the tricks that he had to play**Emily Blunt:**
while Cillian Murphy put everything he has got into the role. Emily Blunt can create a dramatic atmosphere around every line said, especially the scene where we find out about the suicide, and she lets out every emotion you would let out while still delivering the lines necessary. Oh, and she is very good at attacking layersOne of my favourite things about this popular historical movies, is the effect it has on the audience afterwards. Everyone knows that a film cannot be prefect without changing some historical aspects, so it causes so many to research and look into any source they get to find out more. And Christopher Nolan has captured that feeling so well.This film will have a lasting effect on me, purely because of how it combines great story telling with beautiful cinematography. And this will be inspiration for many of my own project in the future, let alone the many others. And I can image this film being the centre of many mood boardsDetails I love:
the water droplets: Especially with the chaotic waves of nuclear war on a map, symbolized by ripples in the waterThe Glove: some people aren't sure if the characters were killed, or it was suicide. To represent this, they showed black gloves hidden in the cornerthe interrogation like scene: when J. Robert Oppenheimer was getting questioned for his security pass, I noticed that the desk were shaped like a mushroom cloud. I also believed that showed the state of power by showing the people being questioned were the start of the reaction and the end of the table was the end."
"'...its a brilliant artistic creation and its faithful to the book.' - Kai BirdNolan at his absolute highest of his capacity. Cillian, on the screen felt like as if he was possessed by one of the most important soul of the 40s & 50s. And as I realise today we are living in the shadows of his actions, Oppenheimer. It restored both cinema and cinematic experience in one shot. No action. No superheroes. No glorifying characters. No CGIs. Nolan achieved the most by exploiting his viscerally tuned mind for making movies.'Dancing between the raindrops...' is the phrase that kind of depicts whats going on inside Oppie's mind. His (a physicist, a clairvoyant) visions are no less than a horror sequence, profoundly sad and feels in an unsafe territory where the World politics take over the genius.Nolan never wanted to explain physics to his audience. He wants his audience to feel it. Yes, he wants his audience to watch his movies in the biggest screens available if IMAX theatre isn't an option, to get the most immersive experience. He calls it '3D without the glasses on'. In a World of sophisticated computer generated graphics Nolan's itch of traditional movie making techniques by recreating cinema in 70mm IMAX camera, the highest quality imaging format ever devised immerses you in. And, who else could make this miracle like job done other than Hoyte, man who carried the 70mm IMAX camera weighing around 30-40 Kgs on his shoulders to get what Nolan imagined. He surely doesn't want his audience to feel safe.The sound mixing is harrowing and not at all overshadowing dialogues as it did in Tenet. In fact the score compliments the tension spots and accentuates Oppie's visions giving it a staggering theatrical impact on the audience. Great improvement by Lüdwig.Since the movie and its elements revolve around one of the critical timelines of the history and its makers. People who (as one should) like discussing World history/questioning World politics/be aware of International cooperation and important events in the history that shaped our society today like McCarthy era will be taken in (in a good way). Even if you fall short of interest, give this movie a chance, may be, just may be in future you won't regret not watching it in a theatre.Also, in a world where devolving your attention span of an adult to a 3 year old child by watching mindless 30secs videos seems more satisfying I don't mind these people calling it boring. The movie raises some fundamental questions and encourages you to think. Sadly in countries where fighting for an adequate standard of living (of food, clothing and shelter) is matter of privilege are yet to receive this cinema as a brilliant artistic creation. Peace."
"Originally, I wrote a review earlier this year for Nimona where I dubbed it as perhaps, ""my favourite film of all time."" Without trying to demean its impact, it isn't even the best film of 2023 anymore.Exploring the life of nuclear physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, Oppenheimer provides a diverse and unique narrative of the protagonist's life, the tense creation of the Atom Bomb and the subsequent disillusionment of Oppenheimer with the American government.Oppenheimer never ceases to impress. The roles will never feel unfulfilled. The soundtrack will never not give you goosebumps. The visuals and editing will always be impactful.Oppenheimer is complex and long but it is a true contender for the title of, ""Nolan's Opus."" It takes a while to delve into but certainly to anyone it is a rewarding watch."
"First of all, I went to see this movie in IMAX and it was one of the best movie experiences of my life, but during the bomb explosions or the main character's visions it was too loud.The acting in ""Oppenheimer"" was amazing, I think Cillian Murphy will win the Oscar for Best Actor and Robert Downey Jr. Or Matt Damon for Best Supporting Actor. I think Emily Blunt or Florence Pugh will get an Oscar or nomination for supporting actress.Usually Christopher Nolan's movies are very strange and can mess up the viewer's head, but this one was not like that because it was based on fact and he had no way to mess up there. In my opinion this movie is one of Christopher Nolan's best anyway.This movie was shot in a way that I knew what was going to happen, but I was still stressed before some scenes.""Oppenheimer"" should be seen by anyone who is interested in history and movies. I highly recommend going to the theater to see this movie, especially the IMAX."
"This could have been an excellent movie with a star studded cast and stand out performance by Killian Murphey. However on a film largely dependent upon dialogue I can't understand why the editors felt it necessary to have constant background music (it never stops throughout the movie) which was discordant and painful to endure. At times it was so loud that hearing what was being said was impossible and even at it quietest it made comprehension difficult.That being said, the movie painted a good picture of Oppenheimers character and the duplicity of politicians and the ultimate dilemma between scientific advancement and humanity of dropping the bomb.Certainly came away with food for thought!"
"I left the theatre in awe of this film. The story is so compelling and expressed the duality of creating a weapon that can save and destroy masterfully. The performances are sublime, Cillian Murphy will rightfully collect plaudits from everyone for a stunning performance as the titular character but RDJ and notably Emily Blunt deliver some breathtaking performances that I am amazed by.Christopher Nolan shows every bit of his genius when it comes to film making, the cinematography is flawless and he picks his moments with sound and visual effects perfectly. They all serve a purpose contributing to the storytelling and the epic cinematic moments in this film.This film is undoubtedly and unequivocally a must see and a contender for Nolan's best work."
"Storyline is quite good. Compared to the films of Christopher Nolan in this movie the coordination, vividity and balance of music/bgm was greatly done. The whole movie from start to end has bgm, only 2min after the scene of bomb there is silence. The time period is shown with minute details. Transition of black and white scenes is a great way to show two scenarios at a time. Scenes and there cuts are wonderfully taken. You will not feel any abrupt shot or moment. Not a single scene is wasted to elongate the movie. Overall the acting of each actor was exceptional especially the protagonist himself 'Cillian Murphy'."
"The movie was okay maybe decent. Are we really going to pretend that we were all at the edge of seats the whole time? I feel like the only people who are honestly rating this a 10 haven't ever pondered on their own the true implications of nuclear weapons and MAD. There was Nothing thought provoking about it. It was long and mostly boring. There's no reason not to wait and see it from home... Unless you want to see an 8 person meeting room on the big screen for an hour and half that is.The acting was of course quite good and deserves to be recognized. I think that RDJ stood out for his part. Honestly this may be the weakest Cillian Murphy role I've seen in the last 10 years. But I think that it's part of the problem. If Oppenheimer was an interesting man, the film failed to show me why."
"Up until trinity I would say the movie was done really well. The last hour felt too long and unnecessary. Although I will say the last 15 minutes captivated me again. I just felt like it was hard to stay focused. I don't think they needed to go on that long about Strauss. I also didn't think the deposition needed that much time either. I think the movie needed to expand on what happened in Japan, because maybe for the people who don't know much about the history of Hiroshima and Nagasaki it could have been more understandable why Oppie struggled with his creation of the bomb. Anyway I just thought it got rough to keep watching. My bf said he almost fell asleep during the last part too."
"The plot of the movie is brilliant. The life of Oppenheimer before, during and after the atonic bomb is spectacular. Oppenheimer having to do with complex things makes the movie more filling. Showing the present and the black and white during it, makes the movie more interesting. Christopher Nolan's best work so far. This is deserved for Oppenheimer knowing how is life worked and how he dealt with things you couldn't imagine you had to deal with. Overall, an excellent movie with very good actors. The acting of Cillian Murphy and how similar he looks to Oppenheimer is illustrious. I would recommend this 3 hour long good movie. It tells a amazing story."
"In simple words this movie was epic. Spectacular work of storytelling and execution. Framing was epic too.There shouldn't be much else said. It was an enjoyable movie, kept me entertained and held my focused throughout the entire movie, almost like my life did not exist during the watching of this movie. Seriously good work. Interestingly I watched this movie thinking it would be thought provoking and awaken something in me but it was more so just fun. Now Barbie, oh boy now that was something, I love Ryan G, that's the man. I believe an 8/10 is fair for a movie that is basically a retelling of actual real life events. It wasn't anything surprising. But an 8 is basically a 10, 3 hours sounds long but feels too short when it comes to this movie. That is all."
"Amazing movie, loved the film. Cillian Murphy with an oscar deserving performance, everyone did well in the movie. RDJ did so well, loved his role in the film. The music by Ludwig was so so good, the build up for detonation was so good with his music. The detonation was really good, the way Christopher Nolan gave the build up towards the detonation was top notch. This is pure cinema. One of my all time favorite film! In one particular scene, everyone moved to the front of their seats, the heart raced so hard, bet no one ever felt like that while watching a film. I highly recommend this film to everyone!"
"Unlike Nolan's other films, this is to watch alone from home with a glass of whiskey.A $100,000,000 was enough to hire great actors and make the best possible dramatic experience, but evidently not enough to make the best possible cinematic experience.Considering that the Trinity test, Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings were the conclusion of Oppenheimer's work. Reducing such events to a dramatic close-up with a great soundtrack is just not good enough.Knowing how much money is wasted on pointless movies, being conservative with a story of this significance knocked 2 stars out from my review because I expected more visuals instead of a dramatic documentary in a crowded cinema. It could have been better!A true story, filled to the brim with legendary characters. A tale of omnipotent spending to destroy an enemy, re-enacted with a modest budget."
"It's hard to articulate all the thoughts, but y'all remember when we used to be kids and watched Batman and lived the character for a few days? Cillian Murphy had a similar impact on me. Ludwig Göransson's score was perfect and will not let you miss Hans Zimmer. Screenwriting is something Christopher Nolan has mastered since Memento. Can we call Oppenheimer Nolan's best work? I'd say no! But this will be considered a film that is unique from the other films he has made. Can we call it Cillian Murphy's best role? A big yes! Because of the superhero movies, we often forget how great an actor Robert Downey is. As Lewis Strauss, he blew everyone's mind! Magnificent actors, Incredible storytelling and Engaging music. A simple 8/10. The only complaint is the run time. I felt like 15 mins from the court room drama can be trimmed."
"I walked into Oppenheimer expecting something incredible, and that is what I got. Oppenheimer is truly Christopher Nolan at his best in terms of script writing, directing and film making. The score, the cinematography, everything about this film is fantastic. Some may find the 3 hour runtime a bit daunting but it doesn't feel like 3 hours at all! The performances from all the cast are amazing and they make the characters truly believable, but Cillian Murphy shines the brightest as he finally gets the lead role in a Nolan Film. His performance is worthy of an Oscar Nomination if not a win. This film is a 100% go see! Watch it in IMAX, it's an incredible experience. However, if you don't like dialogue driven movies then this might not be for you, but I would still recommend you see this work of art. It is a mature story with some sex scenes but if you're 14, mature 13 I would say it's fine."
"Oppenheimer inverts the expectations for what the audience thinks the plot is in the most exceptional fashion. One might assume that this movie is about the atomic bomb and the impact *the bomb* had on the world stage, but it's really about the people, specifically Oppenheimer and the US government. Nolan's decision to omit the dropping of the bombs in Japan was the right choice, as it really demonstrated this film is about Oppenheimer, not the bomb. As such, the ending tied everything together into a neat bow that summed up what the bomb really meant in the evolution of modern society beyond the point of material destruction.The cinematography was very well done and the casting was on par. Cillian Murphy was the perfect choice for Oppenheimer.The moments in the film where the air is sucked out of the theatre with silence only to follow an explosion put a smile on my face. In general, the soundscape design of the film is the best I've ever heard, and this is coming from a professional musician and composer. Usually, I have trouble understanding the dialogue in Nolan's films, but this was easily understandable.The only critique was the pacing, but it was so minuscule that I couldn't consider it a flaw. Maybe other people may have some trouble concentrating, but if you have no issues with this, then you will love this film.I wouldn't say this is Nolan's best film, but it cemented him as the greatest auteur of our generation, and puts him in the running for the best of all time."
"With the amount of dialogue in this movie, I was worried it would feel long and boring. That being said, the movie was made in such a way that kept me engaged the entire time. The soundtrack was amazing, and the transitions between the scenes coupled with the beautiful views of explosions and particles (not using CGI) kept myself holding my eyes open with the fear of blinking for even the smallest amount of time. I do not think the acting could have been any better, and the tense buildup to the trinity test - as well as the final heartbreaking line said by Murphy at the end - was constantly gripping my full attention. In almost every scene I was wondering what would happen next in terms of Nolan's artistic capabilities, and never was I disappointed. When a historical drama can keep you glued with your eyes open the entire time, despite the fact that many of the events portrayed are known to us today, it's very difficult to rate it below a perfect score. The impact of this movie is still making me ponder with wonder about the life of Oppenheimer. This movie is a perfect example that a depiction of one real man can leave people in awe, admiration, and deep thought."
"As auteurs so often must do, whether by choice or by some deep sense of selfishness, they must decide which three hours, out of so many more, to create from a source material that could be combined or split into discrete parts, maybe eventually a miniseries or podcast. As Julius Caesar once wrote, as the victor of the Gallic Wars, all of Gaul is divided into three parts. I have no doubt that Caesar struggled to decide which to write about most, and with what spin.I also have a near-zero doubt that Christopher Nolan struggled to determine which parts of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life to slather together into a three-hour tour of a not-so-subtle reminder that of all the existential threats we humans ignore, it is probably total nuclear war which should be relatively high on the list.Fine acting. Fine dialogue. Cillian Murphy survives through a joyless task of portraying a deeply troubled man, especially when it comes time for an important public talk or a public demonstration of just how big a bomb could be, at least based on current efforts.How many presidents will Gary Oldman portray? Why do we get a third act filled with uncertainty and no intermission? What on Earth has kept us from mutually assured destruction?Or were we always sauntering on borrowed time?"
"How one can make a 3 hour movie about the man running the Manhattan Project, about the brilliant complex physics, technology and the earth-shattering moral dilemmas entailed in putting it to use; and end up mostly making a political soap-opera is at least surprising and at best a missed opportunity.How about not making yet another movie about McCartyism and the plight of the persecuted left? Of what comparative relevance is there in centering the movie around the petty politics of a political nobody like Strauss?Where were the Germans and the Russians? What about the Japanese? And how about trying not to dumb down the physics, but meet the challenge and enlighten the viewer? This could have been a riveting complex story about one of the most deciding periods in modern history and an opportunity to make use of Nolan's uncanny ability to visualise conceptual ideas; as he did to great effect in movies like Inception, Interstellar and Tenet. There is ample opportunity for cinematic brilliance in all the physics discussed in this move, but all we get is scribbled numbers on blackboards and slo-mo explosions. Would this be very much different if made by Michael Bay?"
"This film is truly exceptional in every aspect of filmmaking, presenting an unparalleled biographical drama that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats. The stellar performances by Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Are nothing short of phenomenal, leaving a lasting impact on viewers with their incredible portrayal of the characters. The movie's outstanding musical score further elevates the entire experience, intensifying emotions and immersing the audience into the story.One cannot overlook Christopher Nolan's unwavering commitment to using IMAX film cameras and practical effects, which brings an unparalleled level of authenticity to the film. Watching it, you feel like you are right there, witnessing the events unfold live in front of you. This movie serves as a shining example of how the combination of exceptional storytelling, talented cast members, and a visionary director can create a cinematic masterpiece.Every member of the cast delivers a performance that truly resonates with the essence of their characters, leaving no room for doubt that they were impeccably suited for their roles. The dedication and skill displayed by the entire team involved in the making of this film are evident throughout every frame, making it an extraordinary cinematic experience that will be remembered for years to come."
"The speech after Hiroshima... the way it was captured, and the way that Cillian played... it was a real cinematic experience which I'll never forget.I want to be a film director my self, and when I watched this scene, after the bomb test and Hiroshima I was already shocked about the way it was built from the beginning, but in the moment, when I finally see the legs on the bleachers, hear that stressful sound again, and see Cillian's face, recognise that is the real speech... I cried. It was so freaking well built, and captured. And he did it, all without CGI, in IMAX, with analog... Yeah this is way I want to make movies, he is the one I really look up, cause I don't know when was the last time I felt something like that in a cinema. I am most grateful for this film, it is outstanding, and motivates us, young filmmakers to create something real, something new, something which can really effect the audience, and move something inside them. Thank you Christopher Nolan, and everyone in the crew who helped to make it happen."
"I'll start off by saying I was a little disappointed. But only because my expectations were 10/10 high. I had no issues with the performances, cinematography, pacing, music or length. In fact, those were all near perfect.I think the fallout or weight of the climactic moment could have been felt more though. Obviously as a viewer with a shred of historical knowledge you understand, but it's not because of the movie. That's what I wish was presented a little better - the gravity of the creation and entering of a new age. Instead we sort of devolve into a political/courtroom drama. I don't mind that being included since I understand this is about his life, but the source of his internal conflict didn't quite hit the right emotional notes.So we have pure perfection in all regards for 80% of the movie, and I'm just left wishing the direction of the last 20% was a little different."
"Sincerely lost for words after Oppenheimer. Murphy, Damon, Blunt, Pugh, Oldman and absolutely every one else (literally everyone, be it 10 seconds screen time or 3 hours) at their absolute finest. You are captivated for every single second and feel like the film is only 1.5hrs long. I couldnt genuinely watched another hour. You're held on by every word.No CGI, just clean old fashioned cinema.So effortlessly emotive, beautifully executed and tells the story in such an informative yet fascinating way. Not a second of feeling lost or bored. Anyone could follow and everyone will absolutely love.It's been a long time since I couldn't stop thinking about a film after watching it. Please, do yourselves a favour and watch this. It really is a 10/10."

"Let me start by saying this. I haven't heard of Oppenheimer before, when I heard the hype about this movie I decided to watch the movie but I wanted to read about this character and understand it. I read and learned some information and the next day I went straight into the theater... and oh Lala what an experience. Even though I watched it on Digital IMAX. The visuals, the sound design, the music, the acting, the storytelling, the feelings, the emotions, and the tension were all top-notch. It couldn't get any better!The beginning with the raindrops on the pond and how it is connected with the ending is mindblowing. The look on Cillian Murphy's was terrifying and the emotions in his eyes were indescribable.Overall, 10/10 experience. Thank you, Christopher Nolan, for this Masterpiece."
"I walked out of the theater not knowing what I would say. My mind has exploded. Film bros will list this as their favorite of the decade. Seeing this in 70mm was unlike any movie experience I've ever had (keep in mind my experience has the best visual experience and the best sound so maybe that's why I like it more. Maybe it's not as great in a regular format).Nolan has tackled some of the most high-end concepts in film from the past 30 years. He always gets his cast perfect and gets stellar performances from them. He's gotten some of the greatest film scores of all time. He's always been a unique guy, making outstanding live sets and staying away from CGI as much as possible. A lot of the stuff that he's always been good at, the things he's been doing show up in Oppenheimer. However, the things some of his films get criticized for such as poorly mixed sound overpowering the dialogue, his endings inspire more theories than meaning, he's all brain no heart, and his sophisticated editing covers his shortcomings as director. None of this shows up. It's like this is an entirely new Nolan.Cillian Murphy gives an Oscar winning performance alongside several other potential Oscar winning supporting performances such as Robert Downey Jr. And Matt Damon, my least favorite actor ever. The score wasn't Hans Zimmer, but Goransson captures the essence of the movie in a way very similar to Hans. He suffocated my ears several times with glorious explosions and geiger meter static. The story is gripping, intense, sad, and very bleak. It's character study of Oppenheimer might not be 100% accurate, historically speaking, but it was exactly what it needed to be. Christopher Nolan made a biopic that joins the legends of film history."
"Christopher Nolan just stamped his foot print into cinema history as an all time great. It is as if each film he's made has just been a building block leading him to conduct this masterpiece. Oppenheimer is Nolan's finest work. Murphy delivers a sublime performance, reaching a threshold very few actors ever will. Next year's Oscar statue can be put into escrow for Cillian. Nolans three hour plutonium dense genius-of-physics, magnum opus does for the atomic bomb what Spielberg did for sharks at the beach. It seems Christopher Nolan has turned in a tour de force that has vaporized the competition. In fact, Scorsese's 'flowers of the killer moon' may be the only threat of a rival for best picture. However, that may be the toughest act to follow since Einstein's theory of relativity."
"I'm beginning to think that Nolan has self-esteem issues and desperately tries to prove how deep, special and different he is. Hey look! Non-linear structure of the story to confuse you! Deafening sound mixing to destroy your ears! And no CGI! Can you imagine that bro? A modern film with no CGI! That's how special Nolan tries to be! By the way, there is CGI in the movie. They just lie to him that it's all VFX compositing of photoreal elements.Yet another movie with a non-linear narrative so confusing that I could only suspect what's going on without being certain. I walked out about 30 minutes before it ended and one friend who was considering to watch it asked for my opinion. I literally didn't know what to say initially:
""It's about building the atomic bomb. That's basically it.""I said the same things in my review for Dunkirk (which is not really Dunkirk but soldiers standing on a beach like ghosts). The constant back and forth in time, along with the terrible sound mixing ruin what could have been a fantastic movie. If the project was headed by anyone else it could have been one of my favourite movies.The explosion of the bomb was the only thing I enjoyed and we've all seen images of it online. I didn't have to pay for it. I know this was the last Nolan movie I paid for because he will always mess with the time and sound, desperately trying to appear edgy and special."
"The character assassination of Julius Robert Oppenheimer is a much described and debated subject, and it's basically also what this film is about, I think, and little about nuclear bomb making. Nevertheless, though it's nearly three hours long, director Christopher Nolan still tries to fill the plot with more than is possible, and the results is that it stylistically appears like an endless trailer, where the editing and the jumping in time looks more like a long music video than an epic film. At times it becomes distressing to watch, and it's a great relief when this cannonade of pictures takes breaks in a few longer and slower sequences. If the intention has been to illustrate the main character's inner life during the process, it's perhaps reasonable, but this great topic would probably fit better as a mini series. However, Cillian Murphy makes the very best out of it as Oppenheimer, and despite the aggressive editing he manages to build a credible character. Sadly it doesn't work too well for several other characters, who also are more or less miscasted."
"This isn't a film about the creation of the Atom bomb: this is a biopic meant to exonerate Oppenheimer. But let's be honest: Robert J Oppenheimer is not exactly the star of his own life at this point; in the same way that Dr Frankenstein now shares the name with his monster, the Oppenheimer we know is: Father of the Atomic bomb. That is his enduring legacy. Until now.The movie is premised on the (mostly) professional exploits of Oppenheimer set in an ""Avengers Assemble"" world of midcentury scientists and academics. The movie breezes past nauseating personal failings and betrayals in a manner consistent with it's subject's monomaniacal pursuit to organize people to accomplish the unknown.The world of Oppenheimer (the film) is cloaked in World War 2 though the war is never once show. Instead, the movies plays like a long montage of scientific breakthroughs interspersed with courtroom drama (that doesn't rake place in court).I have a problem with movies that relish blatant nudity and play it for shock value but recoil from showing plain violence. This movie has some sexual content that is meant to shock the viewer (imagined exhibitionism), that feels utterly out of place. Meanwhile we're spared the very real and sobering images from the aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, instead observing the facial reactions of the characters being shown these images.A telling of Oppenheimers life would've been better served as a dramatic and compelling story of solving the ultimate problem to create the ultimate weapon, only to have the man realize too late that he sacrificed his humanity to solve a mathematical problem that unleashed the horrors of his work upon us. There is some of that hear, but it's interposed with a not-so-interesting legal and political drama playing out.I can't help but feel that the IMAX 1.42:1 70mm is somewhat wasted on faces and courtroom scenes, though it is impressive."
The best movie from Nolan every day it is very slow no action full lag but we need to know that this movie is about a scientist who first created a atomic bomb so to tell about how Robert Oppenheimer made that atomic bomb and how many difficulties he faced in making it and after making it Nolan did an absolute fantastic way of telling the story amazing plot and this is the main reason it is slow to make sure everyone understands j.robert Oppenheimer story but if it would have amazing dubbing for different countries it would be more successful that is little dissapointing but however Nolan story way of expression and directing way every one can understand his depth of excellence work simply the most greatest movie ever made absolute masterpieceMy rating1000/10.
"As per usual Nolan delivered a knockout punch with his latest movie Oppemhiemer. Seeing the movie on the day of the release was one of the most impactful moments in my cinema reviewing life. Dynamic and full of contrast, Oppenhimer perfectly captures the rush, fear, and anticipation of the Manhatten Project. The movie is ae easy 9/10 purely for the sake the trailer let the movie on to be more linear. The movies only downside is the constant cuts can sometimes be hard to follow, however, those aspects allow for an abundance of re-watchability. Every actor gave a stellar performance and this movie is something that is both entertaining and educational into the psychological break down Robert Oppenhimer experienced.It is with great pride I can place this movie in my top 20 with a final rating of 9. Go watch this movie on the big screen and except to be blown away."
"Where can i start. This movie adresses a very sad and emotional topic, that i think really connects to our modern world and the future of it. The threat of nuclear weapons is existential, and is always in the back of our mind. The portrayal of this in this film is incredible. Not to speak of the incredible cinematography and writing by Christopher Nolan. The way that the explosion is set out, it represents the mid point of this film rather than the end. It is a very powerful moment, and the sounds and images are just incredible. Nolan also intertwines three timelines, before the bombings of japan, the present (set in the time of these bombing), and after them explaining the repercussions that Oppenheimer faced and the way that the US dealt with this. The ending is even more powerful, and even received applauds from the audience. An incredible movie that i think is one of the highlights of this decade."
"Nolan's direction skills are on full display in this film, as he masterfully blends historical accuracy, emotional drama, and stunning visuals. The film was shot in a combination of IMAX 65 mm and 65mm large-format film, including sections in IMAX black-and-white film photography, which gives it a unique and immersive look. The film also features a score by Ludwig Göransson, which adds to the tension and suspense of the story.The cast delivers excellent performances, especially Murphy, who portrays Oppenheimer as a complex and conflicted man, torn between his scientific curiosity, his moral conscience, and his loyalty to his country. Blunt and Damon also shine as Kitty and Groves, who have their own struggles and dilemmas regarding Oppenheimer's work. The supporting cast includes Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, and Kenneth Branagh.Oppenheimer is a film that explores the ethical and philosophical implications of creating the most destructive weapon in history, and how it changed the world forever. It is a film that raises questions about the responsibility of science, the role of government, and the fate of humanity. It is also a film that celebrates the genius and courage of Oppenheimer and his team, who made a breakthrough that revolutionized physics.However, Oppenheimer is not a film for everyone. It is a long (180 minutes) and dense film that requires attention and patience from the viewer. It is also a film that does not shy away from showing the harsh realities of war, politics, and espionage. Some viewers may find it boring, confusing, or depressing. It is not a film for casual entertainment or escapism."
"Why One Piece Is Better Tan Naruto or other anime?One piece is complex and deep, one of the greatest manga ever you can't compare it to naruto, naruto is simple and straightforward, has no depth at all, mainly for children, while one piece has a more dark world, complex and realistic characters, discussing more complex and detailed themes, naruto has forced drama and the most childish philosophy in anime, while one piece was perfect at the philosophy of freedom and slavery, saying that naruto has more mature themes than one piece is a crime, dude, it is all cliche themes , one piece discussed themes like slavery,racism and slavery of the mind in depth,naruto never discussed a theme in depth,even the most special thing which is pain's philosophy was beaten by talk no jutsu, one piece has cannibalism and famine, people commit suicide because of starvation,maybe naruto is sadder."
"How can one describe something that opens up your mind, challenges things you've read and known and make you appreciate the genius of actors and their art? Nolan does a fine job at all of it.What a fabulous movie! The story and performances were stellar and there was a whole other character in the camera work. Watching this was an experience and what an incredible one at that.3 hours running time but not one time did I feel like that amount of time has passed. It was engaging and intense and had it's periods of comic relief timed beautifully. The moral dilemma from discovering one of the deadliest warfare materials, the aging of a well known name, the interlinking of past and present strikes awe and wonder. I absolutely enjoyed it and I'll probably be going another time for sure. 10/10.Murphy and RDJ heading towards academy awards for sure!"
"The film was great maybe even perfect for the first 2hrs, the last hour was confusing and felt like it moved at a slower pace than the first 2hrs. However the Movie was great no matter the length, great characters and visuals, However the best thing about this was the music, just perfect. The movie Could be Top tier if I wasn't so tired after the movie, Oppenheimer is A great,cinematic, dramatic and visually outstanding Movie, that is only pushed down by its pacing. In all honesty the movie is my Second favourite Nolan film next to the Dark Knight. I will give the Movie a 8/10, worth A watch.Don't worry no spoilers: it might need a second rewatch for me though."
"The movie is good but all that noise about seeing it on the biggest screen possible (I did) is unfounded. It's a procedural and you can see it on any screen you want. I was more impressed with the sound than the visuals. FX are secondary and spare, while the framing of individual shots is rather standard and the cuts so quick as too make it practically inconsequential anyway. It's still worth seeing in a movie theater, and it is a good film with some stellar performances. It's almost a shame there are so many name actors in it because it snaps you out of the story when you keep recognizing people in what amounts mostly to bit parts. It's not Nolan's best but it is a decent drama."
"Pathetic jump scares. Unnecessary nudity. An hour too long.I have nothing against jump scares and nudity - I just don't see the relevance.The first twenty minutes or so the film jumps around abruptly, some parts in black and white, and I thought it was gonna be awful.It was okay for about an hour after that. After we're done with anything bomb related the film turns back into a boring mess of timeline jumping and poor acting. Metaphors of guilt, and grandiose expressions.The ""nuclear"" explosion looks nothing like a real one. Also, he's put a lot of nudity and jump scares in it, so I can only imagine he must've known how boring it was."
"I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long runtime became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end."
"Oppenheimer was a perfect redemption from Tenet. Murphy performance was masterful. The differentiation between of the black and white and color scenes added tremendous depth to the film. Consciously can say this was the quickest 3 hour movie I have ever watched; no scene felt like it dragged on for too long. There were some quirky dialogue lines throughout the film, but were easily washed out by the sheer beauty of the cinematography and performances by the rest of the characters. Nolan is a known physics lover, which is again evident through this film, but at no point was the viewer ever concerned that they would not understand what was being discussed by the scientists. 10/10. Nolan does it again."
"Oppenheimer review
Let me start with the positive aspects of the movie first:
1. The cinematography of the movie was very good
2. The soundtrack of the movie was very good
3. The acting is great, obviously. I especially liked the acting of Cillian Murphy and RDJ.4. The movie describes the birth of the atomic bomb very well
5. The character of J. Robert Oppenheimer is well portrayed
6. The pace of the movie was fluid and despite the criticism I would make, the movie was still interesting and good.7. I liked that the movie was deep
8. I like what the movie does to make us nervous
Things I didn't like about the movie:
Except for Oppenheimer, the characters weren't that deep. I don't even remember the names of any of the characters except Oppenheimer, Strauss, and Kitty. For example, the character played by Florence Pugh. The character is overly sexualized. After investigating Jean Tatlock, after Tatlock's death in 1944, letters and accounts from his friends were uncovered, revealing that he was having affairs with women. According to American Prometheus, his ""homosexual tendencies"" were evident during psychoanalysis. I think some of the characters in the movie could have been worked on.The movie is not understood by many. Nolan likes his movies to be unintelligible, but I think it's a plus that the movie is easy to understand.I don't think there was a need for so many Oscar-winning actors. Okay, the actors are playing very well, but I don't think even extras should be actors with such a reputation.I liked the movie overall. My rating for the movie is 8/10."
"This is a great film in all respects whether acting, cinematography, or music. It's a slow burn though and builds up to a crescendo till the main event --the A bomb explosion.The film presents a raw and gripping portrayal of the ethical dilemmas faced by someone whose choices hold significant ramifications for the world around them.Through a riveting performance by Cillian Murphy , combined with stellar direction and a compelling script, the film succeeds in exploring the internal struggle faced by a complicated character caught between something necessary --building the A-bomb before the Nazis get it--and the potential fallout--the means of wiping out humanity.The last hour (out of the 3 hours running length) is mostly a post-script to the reasons for denying Oppenheimer a security clearance. This is where Robert Downey Jr excels as the scheming and envious Lewis Strauss--an Iago like character who hates Oppenheimer because of his fame and holds a personal grudge as JRO had earlier publicly and openly ridiculed one of his proposals when he was head of the Atomic Energy Commission. This last hour is a means of getting the audience to get some closure and see some retribution for the rough treatment meted out to JRO by a panel set up by the US AEC.While Cillian Murphy is magnificent in the title role, the only actor I could think of that would equal or surpass Murphy in the title role is Montgomery Clift. But he's been dead a long time so this is just an academic point."
"I went to the movies to see what's the hype is all about. At first I already knew that the movie would be phenomenal because it's directed by Christopher Nolan but my God did the movie exceed my expectations, especially in the cinematography, sound effects, and the direction that the directors had from the movie, and seeing how Cillian Murphy impersonated Robert Oppenheimer in the best way an actor should be. And I had a lot of fun experiencing this movie, especially in IMAX thank you Christopher Nolan for this masterpiece. I know I'm not a movie critic or anything but if you enjoy movies and love the cinemas, I highly recommend Oppenheimer."
I might get hate for this but this movie is better then Barbie. It's a masterpiece everything about this movie was good the timing the pacing everything including the acting . My heart was pounding and I loved every second of it holy this was good. Form when it begins to how it ends it explores openhimer before the Manhattan project and then to after the war it's incredible Christopher Nolan deserves every single award they get for this movie bravo. Christopher Nolan take a bow and take in what you created and enjoy our beak I hope to see another masterpiece set in ww2 I can't wait for it bravo !
"I absolutely adore Chris Nolan. However, last film of him just disappointed me for sure. But with this movie , Chris Nolan just made his own artistic masterpiece. In my opinion, this is the most artistic movie of Chris Nolan. The way he picturised the guilt of Oppenheimer is just blown my mind. The scene where Oppenheimer gives his speech against his guilt just proved Chris Nolan knows how to use his artistic inspect to show the horror of scene without showing the consequences that happens in real world. The emotions of the movies is also very beautiful and emotional,making the movie as an arthouse film.The technical brilliance of the movie is also hit the roof . The cinematography of hoyte is beautiful. The music provided by Ludwig is also amazing. Like an opera kind of music , bringing the emotions and tension to the scene. The actors are just wonderful . Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr shows how phenomenal actors they are through this movie . Nothing more to say. Watch it in IMAX ."
"A movie that was undoubtedly amazing and undisputed. We did not feel bored throughout its three enjoyable hours, which was full of many scenes and details as if you were actually living that era in history. The movie was really the pinnacle of cinematic creativity, and is truly considered one of the rare cinematic icons, especially since it was made by the genius director Christopher Nolan, who writes his name in golden letters in history, And let's not forget the rest of the wonderful crew, without exception. I can say that the film deserves to compete for the Oscars this year, if not the best ever."
"When I first heard that Nolan was working on a movie about Oppenheimer I was thrilled, not only because I am a huge Nolan fan but also because I love historical movies and find the Manhattan project fascinating.However, I think Nolan tried to fit way too much context and material in the movie, particularly this whole hearing and flashback type of storytelling doesn't feel compelling as the viewer is constantly thrown back and forth and can't really focus on the present. It could have been so much better if the story was told in a classic manner from the start of the development of the bomb until the end of the war, as this alone provides more than enough content, even for a 3 hour movie.But as the timeline is way too long and some parts told way to quickly (for example, Einstein's letter to the American government warning them about the Germans atomic Programm is just thrown in as a side dialogue line) the viewer can't develop the emotions and suspense this topic actually demands.Wanted to love the movie but honestly left the Theater disappointed."
"Great acting, extremely well made and constantly questions about the dangers of inventing nuclear weapons as you would expect.However, it's mostly talking, name dropping, politics and becomes very boring to me as a result. It is also very disjointed, constantly jumping between timelines and locations.Weirdly the exact thing I wanted to see (how the bomb was made and what Oppenheimer contributed) is not addressed so much!Christopher Nolan apparently doesn't use much ADR and it might be the reason the dialogue mix has been pretty poor in most of his recent movies. When there IS so much talking this becomes quite a chore to have to put up with I have to say, especially for 3 hours. Swelling of sounds and music when people are talking is just irritating. I know this is done for dramatic effect at times but it's just annoying.There is very little footage outside of court rooms and offices in this movie, thus I don't see the hype for Imax at all, but Nolan is able to achieve this exact thing for some reason. However I think he is living of past glory here with the awesome Dark Knight setpieces which were great in that format.Just not a movie for me at all. I love Nolan's Batman movies but everything else he does is just a type of cinema I can't really enjoy.I'm glad others have a better experience with his movies.Your mileage may thus vary."
"Nolan's dialogue is always intriguing, and it is probably the best it ever was in Oppenheimer. However, heavy dialogue films may not be someone's ""Cinematic experience"", and therefore I would advise some individuals to watch the film at home.The film does it's best to make the audience understand at least the basics of what Oppenheimer is working on, however the sound mixing (as usual) sometimes overshadows the conversation, potentially leaving some audience members confused.However I was interested throughout the entire 3 hours, as a lover of cinema, the topic and the historical period, this was a pleasure to watch."
"The best thing I liked about the movie is the character makeup.The scientists Oppenheimer, Bohr, Einstein, Also president Truman. Looks so realistic.It's a feel good movie. Such an epic screenplay, Crisp audio in even part of the movie.People with interest in science will really enjoy this movie top the core.I would say best work of Christopher Nolan as a Fiction Writer.The Trinity Test: The audio mixing is so good that they have captured the sound delay from the blast zone till the person seeing it.There is complete emotion for the character what Murphy has played. The body language of actor and the making of the film. Truly deserves an Oscar.Also RDJ just killed it."
"I really liked Oppenheimer. But! I was kinda disappointed by the atomic bomb scene because i thought it would be more impressive! He should have actually made it more like a real nuke, that's what i think.... . . . . . . . . . . .. . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . .. . .. . .. . . .. . . . . . .. .. . . . . . . . .. . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . .. .. . . .. . . .. . .. .. . . . . . .. . .. . . . . . . . .. . .. .. . . . .. . . . . . . .. . . . .. . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . .. .. . .. . . . .. .. .. . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .."
"While I regret missing my history class, this movie proved to be an excellent substitute, bringing the history of the Atomic bomb to life with engaging storytelling and powerful performances. It highlighted the complexities and moral dilemmas faced by Oppenheimer and the team, making it a thought-provoking experience. As a software engineer, the film reminded me of the significance of innovation and the responsibility that comes with te
In conclusion, the movie based on J. Robert Oppenheimer was a remarkable cinematic journey. It not only satisfied my curiosity about the history of the Atomic bomb but also resonated with my interests in science and technology. The film's meticulous attention to detail and accurate portrayal of historical events made it an educational and emotionally compelling watch. Whether one is a history enthusiast or a technology professional like myself, this movie offers an enriching experience that leaves a lasting impact."
"One of the best movies of all time. To start, Christopher Nolan did a phenomenal job at forming the movie and how he revealed certain secrets. He spent lots of time developing Oppenheimer and just the right amount with other characters such as Lewis Strauss. The cinematography was on a whole different level. Definitely Oscar worthy. Different colorings for different time periods was a very smart choice, and it helped me understand the movie a lot better. During a scene with yelling, the contrast got a lot brighter like a bomb detonating;). You can also see objects shaking in the background the louder it gets. The acting by everybody, even a character who was in one scene storming out of a room, was amazing. Cillian Murphy was the perfect casting choice for a character like Oppenheimer. He conveyed the emotions extremely well and is definitely deserving of at least an Oscar nomination. Nolan really outdid himself and all the hype paid off. I have one slight criticism and that is that there was a very brief period of time near the beginning of the movie that seemed to move a little bit fast but since the movie was 3 hours, it didn't bother me very much. All in all, movie of the year, decade, and maybe even century. Don't believe me? Go watch it and you're sure to be speechless as soon as the credits roll."
"Nolan's 'Oppenheimer' is a gripping masterpiece that delves into J. Robert Oppenheimer's life, brilliantly. The film navigates his genius, moral dilemmas, and the making of the atomic bomb. Nolan's direction, creates an engrossing narrative that lingers long after the credits roll. I can clearly say this is a piece of art with its multi-dimensional narrative style and engrossing concept. A thought-provoking exploration of the consequences of scientific advancements and the complexities of human ambition. The film's thought-provoking exploration of the consequences of scientific advancements forces the audience to ponder the moral implications of innovation in warfare and the enduring impact on humanity. As the story unfolds, the weight of Oppenheimer's choices resonates deeply, leaving viewers contemplating the responsibility that comes with knowledge and power.Visually stunning, emotionally resonant - a must-watch."
"My expectation for Oppenheimer was far different than the product that was delivered. I've been looking forward to this movie since July 2022, but I; intentionally; did not read or watch any media about the film. I read the book 'The General and the Genius' some years back (the film is based on American Prometheus), so my expectation was that the film would center around the relationship between Oppenheimer and Groves. That was not the case. Instead we get a deep dive into the man that was J. Robert Oppenheimer. This alone lends itself to a more abstract storyline, with which some may find it hard to follow.The story is complex, and Nolan has expectations for his audience to keep up and to have some background knowledge of historical events. I love this. The main storyline is also told from 3 points of view. This complexity could have been a nightmare if not handled so well by Nolan and his crew. Truly, layers and layers of complex storytelling all woven into one seamless piece.There are several themes addressed in the film, probably too much for an IMDB review to discuss. Most unique of all is how the politics are represented. Not that one party was completely right and the other wrong, but that the Government is it's own entity and operates in its own interest; personified by Lewis Strauss. No one is a bumbling fool meant to caricature an opposing political party. In other words, this film is propaganda free, remarkably refreshing coming out of Hollywood. It rather focuses on the beliefs of the man and the consequences that come from those beliefs.The acting is the best this year. RDJ will win for best actor in support. Cillian will likely win for best actor. Emily Blunt is deserving of best Actress. Matt Damon does a remarkable job with Groves, just not enough emphasis on the character to make a run at it. No weak performances at all though.Visually, this is the best film I've seen in at least 10 years. The make-up, effects, cinematography, sound, everything. It is all wonderfully put together. Practical effects and shooting on film should be a Hollywood requirement._______________________________________________Now for the negative. The entertainment value for some will not be there. There is quite a bit of exposition in the beginning to define the character of Oppenheimer. This can be dull, but is essential to the film. A lot of people will tune out after this, especially given a 3 hour run time.Kitty and Oppy are both well written characters, but some what hagiographic in their portrayal. Their flaws are mentioned in the opening and second acts, but they don't necessarily define the character or are represented consistently throughout the film. From my understanding, both were pretty difficult people to be around, and that is somewhat lost in the film.The nudity in the film, however poignant it was, felt gratuitous and exploitative. Almost like they were relying on it to carry the story through a trough. It is unnecessary and could have been omitted without losing the story.All in all, likely the best film of the year. Definitely deserving of the Academy Award Nomination it will inevitably receive."
"A deep-seated reverence for meticulous cinematic production design results in a dazzling world class performance of Christopher Nolan's staggering achievements in this historical biopic masterpiece, which features the philosophical atomic concepts of American theoretical physicist, J. Robert Oppenheimer.This heavy movie goes straight into 3 hours full of intense dialogue and provokes a deep sense of curiosity. The overall scenario is tragic as it dives into humanity's darkest hour.Activating mindful focus is highly important. It requires your full attention, as it can easily slip away from an inattentive viewer. Do a little research about the world wars and the characters involved. It would be an addition if you knew quantum mechanical physics theory and how the mechanism of an atomic bomb in simple terms. There is no need to understand, just know.However, Oppenheimer is more concerned with shifting perspectives related to time. The colour pictures represent Oppenheimer's point of view, while the black and white pictures are the objective view of his story told in the third person.""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.""J. Robert Oppenheimer, Father of the atomic bomb.The world would not be the same.A fitting end that leaves you staring into oblivion, the most immersive and riveting experiences are encapsulated in movie form."
"Dunkirk was such an extraordinary film visually and in the the story telling, so appreciately not overly sentimental or jingoistic. Oppenheimer, in contrast was just not that appealing and certainly less than the sum of its many many parts and ultimately is a disservice to the extraordinary moment which brought together so many extraordinary people together for better or worse in The Manhattan Project. As many others have stated this film was overhyped as something that must be seen on the biggest screen possible, preferably IMAX. For one absent one scene and a few 30 second cuts, there's nothing so requiring that type of scale. It's largely an office drama with an identity crisis. Sadly enough also, just oscar clickbait because this really wastes opportunities to delve into the imaginative scientific minds, the think tanks at Princeton, University of Chicago, UT-Knoxville, Bay area Universities, the strong european tradition that most of Manhattan Projects braintrust came from, or Oppenheimer's own personal upbringing, anything to reveal what made the subject tick and become the leader of such a weighty doomsday project. It also wasted the resource of an amazing amount of acting talent to no point. For despite everything that occurs in three hours the impression you are left with is that somehow the point of all of this is to produce The Richard Strauss Show by way of several minutes of Florence Pugh being provocatively naked and intellectual randomly with great lighting and makeup.I bought the high art hype long enough to be intrigued at where we may could have traveled cinematically from the 'I am become Death, Destroyer of Worlds' from sanskrit portion of the show. But that happens in a different iteration of time from this, where Pugh's occasional nudity becomes arbitrarily exploitative for it's deliberate randomness, like so many other scenes. I feel sorry for viewers of this movie that know little or nothing of the science and political history of the Manhattan Project. They will be bewildered for no good reason, might just conclude that this was another elitist hollywood film rather just a poorly executed piece of cinematic storytelling."
"Terrible film overhyped and mislead you with an outstanding cast and director. Unfortunately the film lacked execution and suspense. It was too one dimensional and totally boring!!! That is to put it plain and simple.The acting is what gives this 1 out of 10 rather than 0, the story itself could have been condensed to 1 hour and 30 mins. So many people left the cinema because it dragged on and like hey dude, why create a bomb kill a hundred thousand plus then feel guilty about it?The storylines are not real and all fake. Overall a poor poor film which was so boring and I wish I could get 180mins of my life bacm."
"**Oppenheimer: A Captivating Portrait of a Complex Genius**In the realm of biographical films, ""Oppenheimer"" stands tall as a remarkable masterpiece that delves into the life of one of history's most enigmatic figures, J. Robert Oppenheimer. Directed by a visionary filmmaker, the movie offers a captivating and profound exploration of the brilliant scientist who played a pivotal role in shaping the course of world history during the tumultuous era of the Manhattan Project.The film's greatest strength lies in its exceptional storytelling and attention to detail.

The film's pacing occasionally lags, and some viewers might find the scientific jargon and complex theories challenging to follow. However, these minor quibbles do not detract from the film's overall impact.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a brilliant cinematic achievement that presents a profound and captivating portrait of a brilliant mind caught in the moral quandaries of his time. With its exceptional storytelling, masterful performances, and breathtaking cinematography, the movie leaves a lasting impression on its audience. It serves as a poignant reminder of the ethical challenges that scientists face and the enduring consequences of their discoveries. For anyone interested in history, science, and the human experience, ""Oppenheimer"" is an absolute must-watch."
"Surely it is a film worth-watching! Of course, it's not a documentary so don't go with the hope to know exactly how the atomic bomb was designed, learn about science or quick course in history... US and Russia were fighting together the nazi, finally someone mentioned... Good touch was to say that the bombs allegedly ended the 2WW. For your information, Japan resigned afterwards when Russia was destroyed and invaded their Army in Manchuria.The film is indeed quite long and I personally don't appreciate that much. However, the rhythm of the film makes it easier to be engaged for over 3 hrs. The actors were incredible too, a great cast with my beloved Rami Malek."
"A film for which there are no words.This film achieved something I had never seen before; it brought the entire cinema hall to collective ecstasy. As the key scene unfolded, the hall was brightly illuminated, and silence filled the air. Couples, previously cuddled up and intertwined, sat upright like candles in their seats. When the scene ended, it felt like I had held my breath for minutes. In terms of special effects, it is the best film of the 21st century. The performances by Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt are Oscar-worthy. But the rest of the gigantic cast is brilliant as well. Initially, I was worried about the movies length; three hours could be quite tedious. However, these three hours are absolutely worth it. The soundtrack is outstanding. All in all, it is one of the best films of the century."
"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer film is an absolute cinematic marvel! From start to finish, it takes the audience on an unforgettable journey through the complexities of history and human ambition. Nolan's masterful direction skillfully weaves together a gripping narrative, stunning visuals, and thought-provoking themes.At the heart of this cinematic gem lies Cillian Murphy's extraordinary performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer. Murphy's portrayal is nothing short of mesmerizing, capturing the essence of the brilliant scientist with depth and nuance. His ability to convey Oppenheimer's internal struggles and conflicting emotions adds a captivating layer to the character.Murphy's exceptional range as an actor shines through, making us empathize with Oppenheimer's moral dilemmas, and ultimately leaving us in awe of his talent. His powerful presence on screen elevates the entire film, making it a truly unforgettable experience.In combination with Nolan's visionary storytelling and the remarkable supporting cast, Oppenheimer stands out as a cinematic triumph, deserving of all the accolades it receives. This is undoubtedly one of Christopher Nolan's finest works, and Cillian Murphy's performance cements his place as one of the most talented actors of his generation. A must-see film that will leave you pondering its impact long after the credits roll."
"This was an experience! 3 hour long film that I was not only able to sit through, but was afraid to take my eyes off the screen anxious not to miss even the smaller twitch in the amazing performances. This is a movie completely carried by the actors, the perfiormances are insanely good. The importance of silence is crucial, and it made the film so much more impactful in the short moments of utter silence, there wasn't even breathing in the cinema.Oppenheimer is a quality drama of an ever-consuming scientific ambition that drives the beautiful minds to push the boundaries to the point of being willing to evaporate the entire world for a chance to make something impressive. And the fact that the premise is real makes it even more terrifying, yet completely absorbing.Watching it in Ukraine amidst russian invasion elevates the movie to the whole new devastating level..."
This movie was a master piece ...how well conducted the story line is ..... And sound effects are Just too Awesome to explain ...you will regret missing this movie. This Movie already Have legendary actors but still They performed Thier roles with such Fine acting ...each and every actor showed their every single emotion and They put their heart sweat on this movie and I clearly saw that....

"A film that lives up to the story it tells: an atomic story.It is a film that must be seen with a certain kind of mindset and approach. Despite the exponential ""hype"" that has accompanied the film all these months, it is important to go into the theater and let the film convey its own story, without expectations. Only then will you really be able to enjoy the Oppenheimer world.I'll start by saying that anyone who has seen it called this film too long, boring, or where Robert Downey Jr. Overshadows Cillian Murphy's performance, probably either doesn't understand the film or doesn't understand much about filmmaking.Like every Nolan film, this cinematic product turned out to be a true work of art. It is a unique film of its kind: very fast-paced sequences accompanied by scenes of varying emotional depth; surprise ending, with icing on the cake; and actors with exemplary performances."

This movie and its direction will be liked and understood only by Nolan fans, I am also a big fan of Nolan sirMovie has lot of Conversations, Politics. Courtroom Drama
If you are expecting action scenes in the movie, then there is nothing like that in the movie.There is only one explosive scene in the movie which will make your soul tremble.I got goosebumps watching that scene, that scene is a nightmare Actual detonation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is not shown in this movie only a test run is ShownIf i talk about the performances, then Robert Downey Jr's performance was the best It didn't seems like he was Robert Downey Jr to me he was Lewis StraussCillian Murphy as J.

and cinema loversHindi dub of the movie is bestI loved this movie yes it is a masterpiece movie
I would love to watch this movie againWatch this movie only in theaters."
"""Worst Nolan movie! It's worth watching, but I'm not sure if it's worth the ticket. The story isn't bad because it's a true story; in fact, if you watch 'Fat Man and Little Boy,' you get the same story (albeit with fewer details), and it's a good story, even though the film is old and follows a linear structure. However, compared to Nolan's own films like 'Memento,' the structure of 'Oppenheimer' is indeed weak. 'Memento' is one of the best films in the history of cinema with that kind of structure. Also, you can take movies with a much simpler story that could be told in a short time, like David Finch's 'The Social Network,' which uses the same type of structure and works very well because it has the right amount of cuts and flashbacks. The film is already long, and so many flashbacks for a story like this made the movie tedious. Could see lots of people on their phones after 2h into the movie.Also, The film is easy to understand because no one explains or goes into detail about anything, to the point that it shows several people whom you won't know if you don't already know who they are, throughout the whole movie, you'll be left wondering. My friends asked me several things after the film, mostly about who was who. (-""Who is that guy he went to study with? -Who was the other one who did this or that?"")"""
People giving a good review for this movie are just giving it because they love Nolan..The movie is sooo boring and nothing really happened you don't already know ... really I'm I missing something here..The war criminal who made the bomb is represented in the movie as an American hero who stopped World War 2...Man the director must be delusional and people who think the same too... they really think he's a war hero..Hollywood always justfied inhuman wars that US government committed during time and represented it as good acts...At the end it was a slow burning drama nothing more.. go see yet but keep your expectations low..
"Who does not know the name Oppenheimer? Even if you are not interested in physics or the history of war, you come across this name.Nolan is an amazing director who makes everyone learn more about history with his unique way of story telling. He knows how to make history exciting, the suspense, the drama, the excitement. Even as we know the story, we as the audience are sitting their crossing fingers and hoping for the Manhattan Project test to be successful.The backstory and political aftermaths of the Manhattan Project are incredibly well portrayed and shed a light on the less known part of Oppenheimer's life when world and national politics got involved.Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer is brilliant. Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss is convincing and enriches his bandwidth of acting to a new dimension. Matt Damon is convincing as Leslie Groves.I wished Tom Conti as Albert Einstein and Matthias Schweighöfer as Werner Heisenberg would have received some more screen time.Overall this movie is a highlight of the movie summer 2023. This is another movie best to experience on the big screen. Highly recommended to everyone."
"Despite the 3 hour runtime, it's able to keep audiences entertained and on the edge of their seats throughout the film between the organic dialouge of perfectly cast characters and the build up of the intense scenes. A complex and intriguing story of brilliance, deception, human will, and an urgency to force progress. Just when I thought they couldn't top the test bomb scene they executed the stadium scene absolutely perfectly by keeping you guessing between silence and the crowd cheers until... explosion. An immersable experience where you are contemplating both the scenes from the movie and your own morals by the end of the film."
"Nolan's greatest weakness as a filmmaker has always been found in the convoluted stories he tells. When he gets lost in parts of it to a level that the story itself gets lost as well (see: Tenet). By the nature of this story, he was already protected from that. With that safety net in place, he soared to wonderful heights. This may well be the best cast he has ever assembled for a film, and they carry it beautifully. It is a deeply troubling film that causes us to look ourselves in the mirror. Is the prize worth the price? This will undoubtedly, and deservedly, garner several Oscar nominations, as it should. This very well could go down as Nolan's greatest film. A wonderful achievement given his catalogue."
"I watched the movie when it was released. But now I find the strength to comment...
I can say that it is one of the best movies I have seen in my life. Again, Nolan did not surprise and gave people what they needed. Cillian Murphy didn't act for the movie, he almost lived the movie. Murphy, we watched how Oppenheimer was, how he did not want to stop his achievements, how he always wanted to support science and be a pioneer, and how much he enjoyed being promoted professionally. We learned and felt what a feeling of conscience is under all this fame and intelligence. Every second of the three hours is worth watching.When we look at it historically, this movie helped us to perceive the truth behind the appearance. We have seen what kind of psychology, thoughts and feelings lie behind creating a power that can destroy the world. On the other hand, we felt the burden of being between two women and patriotism. The movie is realistic enough to be worth exaggeration. A masterpiece. PS: Murphy should definitely win an Oscar."
"Nolan is a director who is holding 10 jugs of water which he pours in all different directions, yet all the water seems to pool in one exact spot no matter what. The movie feels like everything going is leading you to a moment, you can feel it coming, you can feel you are being led to it.The movie goes on a fairly low tempo, so consistently low that it made me wonder how Nolan was going to elevate to a climax, but HOLY **** did he do it so swiftly and brilliantly!""Now I am become death. The destroyer of worlds.""And as you reach that moment, it does NOT disappoint. Skin crawls, heart stops for a second, the breath goes out of your lungs, and you can hear a god damn pin drop in the theater.A masterpiece."
I am going to say that this movie is a masterpiece!!! Christopher nolan is a pure genuis for making these kind of movies. When the movie finished i was speechless i didnt talk for fifteen minutes after that i explained how good was this movie. Cillian murphy deserves an oscar. The cast was awesome i literally know everybody in this movie. The bomb scene was amazing first the silence but after the explosion like wow. This movie deserves so many awards. Thanks to christopher nolan for this movie it was one of the greatest movie ive ever seen!!!!Every actor in this movie needs a award and nolan deserves best director oscar!!!
"This movie is quite different from Nolan's usual style. As the title suggests, it primarily focuses on Oppenheimer's life rather than the anticipated nuclear blasts. The highly hyped nuclear blast scene didn't meet the grand expectations, though it did create some tension for a short while.Instead of being a typical blockbuster, the film leans more towards a documentary and courtroom drama, exploring historical events and personal stories. Viewers should manage their expectations accordingly. With a three-hour runtime, it requires a certain level of commitment from the audience, making it essential to have a good understanding of physics and history to fully appreciate the film and avoid potential boredom."
"Movie was fine. I was expecting more physics and engineering and excitement of real science and emotional phases of Oppenheimer, suspense before tests, not focus on trivial human trials by dumb politicians. Since its about great geniuses, i cant rate it low. Could have been better!Could focus on collecting all the scientists, building up of the town in middle of nowhere. How the russian spy worked to transport message. The emotional phases, debate for righteousness. Suspense during testing. Betting on quantity of explosion. How technical and engineering marvel was achieved. Not knowing if it works, etc. Its nice, but could had been one of the great movie of all time. Missed the chance."
"I went into this film very excited, as I had not seen a Christopher Nolan film in the theatre yet. Nolan has become as big a draw as the stories his movies tell, so when he releases a film, it's an event.That said, I settled in for Oppenheimer. The story of the building of the first atomic bomb, and the man who headed up the team should make for a fascinating morality tale. Can you live with yourself knowing you had a large hand in incinerating thousands of human beings (many of them civilians) what did your genius unleash on the world? Was it the right thing to do even though Germany would have dropped the bomb on us had they had the chance? All valid questions, and unfortunately, not really given a lot of time in this movie.It's more about the man's life, his mistress, his wife, his colleagues, etc. Which is fine, but the crescendo should have been the bombs themselves. As it turns out, that is just the 2nd hour of this three hour film. The last dealing with Oppenheimers appearance in a kangaroo court set up by his one time boss at the US atomic energy commission, in response to an insult delivered in front of a congressional hearing. Not exactly riveting stuff. It's a shame, this could have been a truly great movie, but what the bombs did, and what they meant for the world on the verge of the Cold War were not given enough screen time. These were truly weapons on a scale that the world had never seen before, but you wouldn't really know it watching the film. If you didn't know the history of WWII, you may feel lost, and if you went into this film wanting to learn about why the atomic bomb was such a historical event, you may also come away less than satisfied."
"The first hour is jumping between different rooms where people are having lengthy conversations about physics over dramatic music. The second hour is more of the same with a sprinkle of moral contemplation. The final hour has 20 minutes of drama (spoiler- they drop the bomb- horrible of course but the only plot point that held my attention) and then another 40 minutes of guilt and buck-passing.Nolan just attempts to disguise his long, confusing, and ultimately dull masterpiece with lots of dramatic music and time skipping. I would have rated it lower but the performances by a stellar cast were worth a couple of points.Don't drink the cool-aid. This is not a masterpiece, it's a bore-fest."
This is one of those movies that makes you want to learn more. Not only was the story told with such vivid images without showing any. The acting is emotionally complex and layered. The sound track was amazing. The use of silence was amazing. Loved everything about this movie and plan to watch again and again.It's definitely a movie that needs multiple viewings since there are so many pieces to the story. It's not as simple as one man's actions. The use of color and lack of in areas to define the time was incredibly helpful to follow a complex story. Rarely do I feel movies leave the viewer's having conversations about morality and a view on how devastating technology can be. This is one. Just an amazing movie.
Tells a brilliant story about one of the most influential people in recent history. The nitty details about Oppenheimer's life are mesmerizing. Everything from his affair which ultimately semi-led to his downfall to how he orchestrated one of the most important scientific breakthroughs of all time captured how this man needs more recognition. This picture paints his story very well with a lot of aspects covered that would not normally be in the limelight. Performances from Murphy and Downey Jr were captivating and gave truth to the history which once was. The cameos we're not unneeded and the practical affects were jaw dropping.
"This is unlike any other movie Nolan has made until now. While going to the theaters, I thought this movie would be about Manhattan project and the psychological effects of the bombings on Robert Oppenheimer, about how he thought he was responsible for the deaths and misery caused by his creation but this movie is much more than that.It is about the malicious propaganda he had to fight against to protect his reputation and his credibility. It is ironic that the man who built the atomic bomb for America hard to prove his loyalty to his country. This movie dives deep into human behaviour and shows just how blind humans can be because of our ego and our ignorance to reality.The way this complex storyline is made into a film is masterful to say the least."
"It's a rare relief when a film is released that isn't laced with left wing political messages, and doesn't incorrectly cast white men as either women, black, or both. We need more films with 90% female casts, but we don't need to lie and pretend history is differentThe story is powerful and hits on more levels than you'd expect. The acting is great aside from a few cheesy one liners, all of which seem to have made it into the trailer. I expected a cheese fest like the imitation game, but was subtly surprised to find very little. This is the first movie/book that has allowed me to really understand some of the decisions that were made part way through world war 2."
"On Friday 21st July, I experienced Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer in stunning 70mm IMAX.I was blown away.The new masterpiece biopic, based on the American Prometheus biography, beautifully tells the trials of atomic bomb father, J Robert Oppenheimer.Ireland's Cillian Murphy is mesmerizing as the pioneering physicist. There's a way that Murphy can convey madness, melancholy and morality, and those hypnotizing blue eyes are perfect for the role of Oppie too! In a heart- racing, dialogue-heavy, 3 hours, split between 2 viewpoints (Fission and Fusion), we see Oppenheimer transition from a young, handsome but depressed Cambridge student, to the middle- aged, Thin- White- Nuke- weapon- creator, to a frail old Oppie, battling cancer.Cillian's supporting cast, including Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Junior and Matt Damon each magnificently play the real- life figures who metaphorically 'collided' with Oppenheimer in the events leading up to the 1945 Trinity Test, and it's aftermath.New notable Nolan collaborators include Florence Pugh, Benny Safdie, Dane Dehaan and Rami Malek.This movie is both thrilling and horrifying, but so spiritual too. We feel the remorse Oppenheimer felt about his actions, and hear his famous words quoted from the Hindu Bhagavad-Gita: ""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds"".The sound and vision is sublime. Ludwig Goransson's visceral violin score reminds me of the tension in scores to The Dark Knight, Tenet, There Will Be Blood and even Good Time, to name a few- and, inevitably, the horror of Penderecki's Hiroshima strings. The accompanying explosion of colours on the gigantic screen made my hairs stand on end, and suspended me in space and time.Oppenheimer has a longer theatrical release of 100 days and time is ticking, so go and experience this new atomic classic in IMAX. After all, my ""theory will take you only so far"". 💥💥💥Words by Melissa Roden."
"For me, maybe, the best biographical film of all times.Finally, after a long time, a blockbuster that really had a script, where it was only about a great camera, editing and sound. Nolan made one of his best films. For me - better than Tenet and maybe even better than Interstellar. It's magnificent, deep, it has a lot of references and ideas to work with, and at the same time it's so cut that you enjoy it from start to finish. Maybe almost to the end - and that's the only complaint. A couple of cuts in the second half might have improved the audience's experience, but I'm already digging into the work, which is otherwise almost perfect. A return to honest filmmaking in Hollywood."
"The film lasts approximately 3 hours, it is more like a Documentary. Where all the problems that arose when creating the Atomic Bomb are analyzed. The performance of Florence Pugh, Robert Downey Jr. And Cillian Murphy, among others. It has no discussion, very good actors. The R rating is for about 3 nudity sex scenes. But outside of that, it's all talk and talk. They are also suspicious of historical data that were previously secret. We hope it will be nominated for an Oscar, even though true stories are almost never awarded. People compare the Barbie Movie with Oppenheimer, when it cannot be like that, since Barbie is all fictional and its rating is PG-13, when Oppenheimer is a true story with an R rating. I recommend it to 95% to see it, it is very good. Go see it!!"
Excellent movie ! There's some astonishing execution of the views and the things and the acting was top class .... These kinda movies are really rare and worth watching ... The roles were perfectly presented and executed and every detail was looked over precisely.. I mean I have seen people making some funny reels and memes on it as they couldn't understand but honestly I couldn't connect more and be indulged in it and it needs patience and focus to feel it ... so it wasn't meant for the ones looking for fun or casual enjoyment but it was meant for the actual good contented watchers . I would recommend people to look for themselves and not be influenced by the reels and memes people are making !
"I have to admit I'm not the biggest Nolan fan, so my expectations for this movie weren't high. Nevertheless, it was even worse then I expected. By worse, I don't mean unwatchable, but boring and average af. The dialogue is so crushingly pathetic, shallow, even cringe at moments, it feels like AI wrote it. Visually, there's nothing new, you won't be mind-blowed, which is perfectly fine, but that leaves us with.... nothing to write home about. I came to a conclusion that it would perhaps be better if Nolan solely directed his movies and left writing to others, as it really isn't his strength. This is not movie-related but I'll write it anyway because I can: it would be really nice if directors like Nolan who have a huge fan base and are capable of making good and fresh movies (which I think he is, see: Following) would really do that instead of a vanilla movie made to please everyone and therefore offering nothing of substance. There aren't many people with that kind of reach and I assume liberty/funds to do what they want, so I guess my point is that in a perfect world it would be a moral obligation to use that power to move boundaries and broaden our horizons. This is of course not a direct attack on Nolan, maybe the guy really is restricted by the industry and not allowed to do witty and meaningful movies, who knows. I only wish there were more artist showing the middle finger to the Hollywood studios and insisting on doing their thing (David Lynch I love you)"
"So I'll take the contrarian view here and say Oppenheimer is basically kind of bad. I don't think we'd be seeing these sorts of reviews if the movie was promoted or hyped up less. Very sad but true. I did my best to conceal my serious disappointment while I was at the theatre, didn't want to seem a party pooper. I went to the theater hoping I was going to be watching a genuine revival of Hollywood or something along those lines- that I would lean away from speed, colour, and volume, just a little bit back towards pacing, character, narrative. I understand it is a blockbuster film, I was just hoping the needle would move somewhat in the other direction of the general trend in a film such as this. No such luck.What we do in fact get is a basically relentless exposition dump scored to the Inception soundtrack. The main character doesn't have much character, the supporting characters don't have enough air to breathe after all the rapid-fire delivery of exposition and information about what's going on to develop personalities of their own on screen, for the most part. The soundtrack is indeed relentless and I began to suspect that it was so constant in order to cover up the fact that there's not really much of any narrative tension in the movie.If you go watch this in theatres you will find yourself occasionally buffeted by explosive walls of sub-bass at peculiar times (the actual detonation of the bomb is actually one of the quieter explosions in the movie).I think what bothers me the most is that there is so much budget, so much acting talent, loaded into this movie. And for all the resources allocated to this project, the result is basically uninspiring, emotionally flat, basically attempting to buffet you into having a reaction through momentum. It shouldn't be like this considering the movie's subject matter ie, people talking in labs, boardrooms, over glasses of wine, in lecture halls. It's just not the right way to film this sort of plot.You've already seen it, I'm sure you liked it, but for me, it's a sore disappointment and shows that Hollywood cannot really do it anymore.Final gripe: seeing Oppenheimer reclining in his La -Z-Boy in the nude after smoking hot sex is extremely stupid, but also funny. So perhaps not a gripe."
"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch."
"A star studded cast, an excellent background score and a creative director. All combined in a movie that had me engaged till the end as the plot became more and more intense as time progresses, 3 hours passed very quickly. Definitely recommended for people who love biopics. Most importantly, you need to feel the movie not understand it as Nolan said. The colour scheme was so very perfect, the attention to detail was also pretty eye catching. Ludwig Gorannsen did an excellent job with he background scores. Overall, nothing short of an exciting experience. Finally I'll end it with this quote ""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds"" - J. Robert Oppenheimer."
"A mind-blowing masterpiece of cinema Oppenheimer is not just a movie, it's an experience. Christopher Nolan has outdone himself once again, creating a stunning biopic that explores the life and legacy of one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century. The film is a visual feast, shot in IMAX and 65mm film, with breathtaking cinematography and practical effects. The cast is phenomenal, especially Cillian Murphy, who delivers a career-best performance as the brilliant and tormented J. Robert Oppenheimer. The screenplay is smart, complex, and emotional, weaving together historical facts and artistic liberties in a captivating way. The music by Ludwig Göransson is haunting and powerful, enhancing the mood and tension of every scene. Oppenheimer is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves all the praise and awards it can get. It's a must-see for anyone who loves movies, history, science, or just great storytelling. It's the best film of 2023, and possibly of all time."
"With a duration of 180 minutes, we are granted the virtue of witnessing a masterful representation of how the human being can set aside their own humanity when obstinately clinging to their ideals. It is truly admirable how the film delves deeply into moral themes and how its messages impact and move the audience, leaving an indelible imprint on the human psyche. The unique narrative of this film far surpasses any other production based on historical events, even if the latter may not be rigorously precise. However, it is precisely in this imprecision where its charm lies, for the film does not seek to be a mere documentary; rather, it is an emotional and profound portrayal of a range of feelings experienced by the protagonist throughout the film, including guilt, resilience, anguish, and many others.Accompanied by a masterful soundtrack, the film stands out for its raw and evocative scenes that immerse the viewer in a palpable silence, creating an almost eerie intrigue. Even if the audience might lack knowledge in the scientific terms addressed by the film, it is astonishing how Nolan manages to construct such a complex plot centered around the creation of the atomic bomb and its consequences, while remaining accessible and comprehensible. This achievement is an undeniable asset, considering that some directors deliberately aim to complicate their works in pursuit of a perceived quality, whereas here, an extraordinary balance is struck between depth and narrative clarity.Moreover, it is delightful to observe the meticulous approach taken in addressing the inherent problems associated with the potential catastrophe that an atomic bomb could unleash upon our planet. Literally, the film portrays the devastating impacts of such a disaster, while conceptually, as the plot unfolds, various meanings underlying the concept are interpreted.Another outstanding aspect lies in how the film refrains from presenting an absolute idea regarding religion or beliefs prevailing within its context. Although the word ""communism"" is frequently mentioned, the film refrains from imposing the notion that this movement holds an absolute truth, a common occurrence in numerous instances. Furthermore, the absence of computer-generated effects (CGI) in favor of a classic cinematic style enhances the film's audiovisual spectacle, heightened by the visual impact of brilliantly executed black and white scenes. It is truly gratifying to appreciate this seventh art form in its pure essence through these sequences.Without further ado, it is worth noting Cillian Murphy's remarkable performance, which stands as one of the finest in its genre. Therefore, I wholeheartedly recommend the complete viewing of ""Oppenheimer,"" a cinematic masterpiece that undoubtedly deserves to be experienced in a theater to fully appreciate its exquisite audiovisual effects."
"Out of all of the films I've seen within the year, this has to be the best. From the brilliant casting to the amazing story, or the overall incredible cinematography, it was phenomenal but long.The scenes were stunning, with fantastic visuals, whether it's the atomic bomb or just another day.The story was just fantastic, really bringing to life how J. Robert Oppenheimer came to become the father of the atomic bomb and what happened following the events of it's creation.It could've been shorter, some parts just felt like they didn't need to be there, such as the last half an hour or so. Other parts I wish were expanded upon more throughout it the film.At some parts it also could be a little difficult to follow along with that the film was explaining, but that changed once you understood how to read the movie.Nonetheless, Christopher Nolan has created a wonderful masterpiece of a film, but maybe not one that you need to see in IMAX or even the movie theatre in general, unless you really wish to see it."
Great movie by nolan man i was not ready for this movie shows the side of oppenhimer and other Scientists as well the mental problems of Scientist facing the idea what they created and political point of view on the matter. Just great movie. So much thing in 3 hours. END of THE MOVIE WILL BLOW YOUR MIND.Movie is so good they covered everything thing about oppenhimer as much as they can. You need to be prepared for this movie do study some science and know about the political scenario of that time. He experimented on this stuff with direction and black and white colour.Movie is good but STAY AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T LIKE THE MOVIE.
"I just watched the most amazing movie ever and I can't wait to share my thoughts with you! It was a masterpiece of storytelling, cinematography, acting, and music. The plot was captivating, the characters were complex and relatable, the visuals were stunning, and the soundtrack was perfect. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, laughing, crying, and cheering. It was an emotional roller coaster that left me breathless and satisfied. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves cinema and wants to experience something unforgettable. It was one of the best movies I've ever seen and I'm sure you'll agree with me once you watch it too!"
Where do i start i came into this movie thinking i will not understand anything and coming out of it i felt i was still in that cinema watching. Great acting by Cilian murphy give him his oscar now he really deserved it and shoutout to (MATT DAMON) who made the only joke in the film. Its really intresting and never has any boring parts and really liked Robert Downey Junior for great acting. And again another masterpiece buy (Christopher nolan) the one thing i really liked about this film is that you is how oppenheimer was soo serious and a fun character at the same time really liked emily blunt.And thats all but one more thing THIS MOVIE IS A MUST-SEE (MASTERPIECE)
"There is nothing to write home about this one. Sure, the acting is decent and the photography is ok, but that is a standard for any solid movie. It is hard to make a masterpiece when you have predefined limits of a biopic genre. Directors usually don't have enough creative freedom to really push the limits. Maybe it's just me but I don't find the story or protagonists very compelling. I actually love science but this was already familiar matter to me. Also, it feels too long and the narative is a nothing new, present day actions interweaved with flashbacks from the past. If I would want to watch a biopic I would rather choose a movie like Aviator, Air or something similar."
"The unnecessary sex scenes ruin and otherwise very good movie 9/10. We get about 2 hours and 57 minutes of physics, political intrigue, bureaucratic management, and 3 minutes of soft core porn that does NOTHING to move the film forward. As a student of physics, it was great watching a movie try to explain some of the problems in physics to the general public. Oppenheimer had a very high IQ, but along with that came some of his faults. It wasn't necessary to show these in bazaar way of him having sex in government meetings.I'm thinking about President Kennedy, you've probably seen the movies ""PT 109"" as well as the movie ""13 Days"". These two great movies were well received, and did a good job describing President Kennedy at various points in his life. They managed to do this without giving us sex scenes of President Kennedy with Marilyn Monroe, Gene Tierney, or others.The movie is already quite long (3 hours) the removal of 3 minutes would make it VASTLY superior and make the movie available to younger audiences who would also enjoy it. When the movie is available on home video, I will buy a copy and edit out the filth and make a much better copy for myself. There was no need to include total nude sex scenes in this movie. It takes away the concentration that the public had in the conversation that they were tying to have. Sadly that actress will be forever known as the naked chick in the Oppenheimer movie.Some will say the soft core porn was needed for the story. Just as not having a ""steamy sex scene"" prevents Casablanca from being a classic..."
"Just got back from seeing Cillian Murphy in, what I believe, is a career best performance.Hauntingly raw emotions on show from the entire cast and a story with enough weight to carry it for (almost) the entire 3 hour run time.Complex in it's delivery as well as its subject matter, the film kept me invested albeit slightly confused over the frequent jumps between periods in Robert Oppenheimers incredible life.The politics are there, but, aren't focused on until the final act, which was welcome, so as not to bog down what I believe Christopher Nolan set out to explore. That of a mammoth undertaking, both of physics and of pyshce, and the toll that effort can take on the individuals involved. The moral issue around using such incredibly destructive weapons is something we should all continue to consider as the world we live in continues moving forwards.Beautifully shot, well written and excellent performances coupled with Nolan's immense sound design make Oppenheimer the first film I've ever wanted to review on IMDb!Just go and see it."
"This was the first movie that made me think for hours after it ended.Up until now I just left the cinema, and I didnt have any opinion or thought.It's long like 3 hours I thought that I might be bored but it made me listen, see, and think the entire time. If you really want to learn history in an enjoyable way you have to go see this.The sounds and the music will drive your emotions, and the story your brain and thoughts.The whole movie is like an emotional roller coaster. I was excited, angry, annoyed, happy, concerned.The only negative thing I can mention is when the atomic bomb explodes. For me it was small :D not visually big enough. The explosion's sound was not loud enough."
"This movie is 3 hours long, and in this time it tries not to be boring for the viewer. The intense shifts of flashbacks and flashforwards are keeping the movie fascinationg to watch. The scenes from Oppenheimer's life and other people related to him is like a puzzle, that is interesting to collide into the whole chronological picture.The visuals are stunning, montage is fast-pased and never getting boring, and dialogues with music can definitely tell you that this is Christopher Nolan's movie.I eould re-watch it at the future, because I would like to understand story more. It already is turning to the cult classic. This movie exists to become one.One of the concerns I have-the moment of atomic explosion. The buildup was massive, but compared to it, the explosion felt flat and not-impactful."
"Go see it in Imax and the slight increased ticket price is worthy of your money, it's a visual and audible feast, good value entertainment is hard to come by these days and this delivers. I'd dissuade anyone from going just for the explosion this is a biopic based around a key point in Oppenheimer's life, not just building a bomb. After reading some reviews I thought it'd be challenging to keep up with a few timelines but it was a breeze, the pace although on the fast side makes for compelling storytelling. The score and sound are perfect and exactly what you'd expect from Imax, the well placed/timed loudness adds to the experience and makes this a well constructed immersive look into the life of a controversial historical figure. Just on my way to binge all Nolan's movies now."
"Oppenheimer is not a film, it's a symphony that we could never before fathom. In my opinion, it is one of the most important films to ever exist. I remember feeling like this regarding a few films, such as this past year's phenomenal all quiet on the western front but this movie is the biggest and scariest true account of what it means to be alive. The deep sadness that overcame me after experiencing this film glued me to my seat. The fact that our supposed holier than thou goverment could inflict so much pain on a single man really broke me.Below is an in detailed look into different aspects of the film.Overall the whole movie is an impressive showing of scientific innovation in cinema but most of all, this film took a step to storytelling that has not been seen before. The cinematography was breathtaking. The use of practical effects helps add a magical effect of realism to the film. The sound mixing was definitely an upgrade from tenet. As far as orchestration, I have never been more blown away. I had chills the whole time. I quiete enjoyed the attention to detail in the costumes, they really felt like the best choice for each and every charector. As far as acting goes, I'll save Cillian for last. RDJ gave in my opinion, his best performance of his career. Emily blunt really did phenomenal, I absolutely adored her in the scene where she finds oppenheimer distraught over the loss Tatlock. I loved how Matt Damon helped anchor cillians Oppenheimer, giving use the most balanced performance. Some supporting parts stood out to me. I felt goosebumps ever time I saw Dane Dehaan, his menacing smile was truly amazing. Kenneth Branagh and Rami Malak gave great performances given the screen time. My favorite supporting actor had to have been Alden Ehrenrich. He had in my opinion one of the best scenes in the film. Finally, the man of the hour, Cillian Murphy. Never in my life did I think I'd get to see a performance of this caliber. Cillian held us from the first time we see him. Every breath was perfection. You can not teach the talent the cillian holds. He has such a unique talent of fully opening himself to the emotions necessary for the charector. This gives his performance such realism. His ability to emote just using slight movements in his face and eye truly sold the performance. The scene with Gary Oldman truly shows this ability. We see Murphys face as he is attempting to plea with Truman. His pleas going unnoticed broke me and seeing the slight welling of tears in his eyes as he realizes Truman does not care about him sold the scene.No movie in my opinion can be the best movie ever. That statement is far to subject but to me, I feel I can say that this is the most important movie to date, not only to cinema, but to life."
"This movie is truly a work of art. The frames, the expressions, the actors, the scenery, everything. I cannot put my finger on one particular point that made it great, because the movie in whole is great. I know everyone says it is, but that is because it genuinly is!You really get into the head of Oppenheimer, how he feels and what he thinks, which very rarely movies I've seen do.And then the music... Wow! The music. It is so fitting to the story, I cannot stress that enough.I don't know if it was only in my movie theatre, but I felt the volume was quite loud, unusually so. That had an psychological effect on me, I was felt genuinly frightened by the sudden explosions, not in the manner that it destroyed my eardrums, but enough to be frightening.The only part that could have, and should have been edited more is the last part. It becomes quite challenging to watch, but oh boy is it worth watching as a whole.I cannot recommend this movie enough."
"The music for this movie is the best I have ever seen in a movie before. The build up of the explosion of the bomb with the music connected with it made nervous for it. Even though I already knew the outcome, that the bomb was going to go off. The music was what stood out to me the most for being breathtaking. But everything about this movie was great. To the film writing, to the great room of actors that were in this film. The acting was on point. I personally thought the pacing was very good. When a 3 hour movie feels like an hour an a half long so thing is done right. I was hooked with every part of this movie, with having no boring parts in the film. With the show being mostly dialogue, it really says a lot. Amazing work by Nolan as usual."
"Such a captivating film throughout. Theres a lot of information and dialouge to this film but each scene is short and fast paced, like it resembled the pressure and urgency of their task. The short, fast paced scenes keep you interested and on the edge of your seat as the film builds and builds up to the point of the test. My only critism is the explosion itself, although the sound was okay, it didn't feel as dramatic as there were a lot of loud scenes leading up to the explosion so it felt underwhelming in comparison. I also feel that the visuals of the bomb was slightly underwhelming. However, I believe Nolan didn't want to use any CGI for the explosion so considering it was done with real explosives, it was still impressive. Nolan never fails to suprise me with his films. A must watch."
"As an aficionado of quantum physics, and the history of science, I had high hopes for this film but the writing and direction were a major disappointment, with the first and most important mistake being the choice of a feature length film! It should have been a 3-4 season series on Netflix or HBO. The entire movie was too fast, not giving time for the incredible cast to strut their stuff, or the viewers to absorb the complexity of science, moral choices or the fine acting of Murphy. There were single lines in the film that could have been made into a one hour episode. Nolan's choice of animated depiction of quantum physical matters was amateurish at best."
"I'm a Nolan fan but not a fanboy to the extent I'll gloss over what I consider less than Interstellar work (see what I did there)Also not going to give it a one star just because it's was bored out of my mind and thought there was some really weak writing and over-acting.I'd hoped for some significantly more interesting visuals and much more intrigue that surrounded the team that developed this beyond Oppenheimer (the book ""Bastard Brigade"" was a thousand times more interesting than this hyper focus on the apparent witch hunt to protagonist)Really did just gloss right over the most horrific and atrocious event in human history and the fact that our country did that in a war we had ostensibly already won. Yay America ammiright.If someone has a good reason why we got a sex scene I'm all ears. Easy enough to depict him as a lothario without that, it was tantamount to Having a Oskar Schindler nice scene that nobody asked for.So the biggest miss for me was that the films tension seemed not to rest on the race to build the home before and enemy that would use it (Nazi), or even communism really or the Cold War as other than a plot device with no palpable fear or context but the fact that Oppenheimer would lose security clearance and outside of a fearful Kitty they'd lose their house, we had no reason to care if he lost his gig, or what the aftermath of that meant. Like three hours to tell me how a guy lost his gig and maybe got some mud slung on him after a remarkable achievement.I do know one thing, this film goes immediately into the category of movies I will never watch a second time and that's a shame because many of his films are ones I own and have seen numerous times (some which I've enjoyed even more on repeated viewing).Sorry Chris, this is a swing and a miss for me just like Tenet was."
"I've seen this movie three times in theatres and could easily see it three more. It's got incredible scope, breakneck pacing, and a kind of narrative and character-generated complexity you don't see in a lot of Hollywood releases. What I like most, though, is how Nolan continues to treat his well-known themes in new and interesting ways.I find a lot of Nolan's movies cold. I'm not a huge fan, for example, of Interstellar, Inception, or Tenet. All suffer from a kind of conceptual overload where the narrative framing appears front and centre as ""innovative"", but often at the expense of my investment. Interstellar looked beautiful, and some of its set-pieces (particularly the black hole) were incredible--but it wanted to tell me directly about love and the scientific/evolutionary benefits of love, and so, in my view, ended up becoming sappy and heavy-handed, particularly by the end. Instead of offering a mystery, the tesseract stood as a great-big, obvious allegory for love and time: of timeless love, actually, which, in my view, *ick*.Inception, while slick and original and thrilling and ""layered"" (obviously), completely forgot any sense of place. The whole movie lacked, for me, any kind of texture. While it's true the story ""really"" takes place on a plane over the ocean--and arguably the movie is about a kind of corporate emptying out of place as a result of globalization--the film embraced this placelessness rather than really offering it as a problem, and so all the sets took on the same colours, tones, and shades. It felt either like I was in a corporate office for the whole film, or maybe even more ironically, it felt like the whole movie was made with CGI: Nolan found a way to give reality the same effect as CGI, to turn reality into a dream--yes, I get it, maybe that was the point. But why dream in so one-note a way? Why dream about corporate offices? I'd level this same critique at Tenet, too. The end battle in the placeless city reminded me of the conceptual dream-space of Inception, and the plane crash near the beginning was more of a concept than a set-piece.But since this is, in fact, a glowingly positive review of Oppenheimer, I also need to mention there are these other Nolan films, like Dunkirk and The Dark Knight, which care deeply for place and enable the textures of the physical world to do their beautiful, filmic work. Oppenheimer belongs (ambiguously) in a kind of in-between place with respect to these two sides of Nolan's filmography, which is one reason I think it's so fascinating. On the one hand, you've got Los Alamos and the incredible visualizations of scientific concepts that erupt into full force on screen in the Trinity Test. You've also got Oppie's education in Europe and his various classrooms. Lastly, you've got the windowless, government rooms where the law does its work. On the other hand, much of Oppenheimer deals with transforming theory (or abstraction) into reality. Thus, abstraction takes on, for the first time in my opinion, real dimensions in Nolan's story. And while the movie is still cold (a coldness that Murphy's performance excels at) it feels intentional here, rather than a side effect of Nolan's narrative innovations in some of his previous films.This is his best movie about turning theory into reality (a problem he explores most openly in The Prestige, Inception, Interstellar, and Tenet). At the same time, there's the world that must experience the consequences of this new reality, which is treated with much more care. Los Alamos is gorgeously rendered--though I would have liked to see even more of it in order to tip the movie truly into the second category. The one-note textures of these prior films return in the trial scenes, though again, on purpose here. Oppenheimer's scientific visualizations compel interest in ways that the dreams in Inception never can for me. And the Trinity Test is Nolan's best piece of filmmaking yet. The fire is theory-made-real--but it's distorted, defamiliarized, and its consequences (in the form of sound-engineering) don't hit until a little later.The movie's three-hour runtime enables characters--rather than theories--to take centre stage. Oppenheimer is complex and certainly not a great man, in terms of the ""great man"" theory of history. We see him, by turns, as the ""great improvisor"" (says Dr. Rabi) and as a weak man who cannot look at the consequences of his own actions. The time to make this film is now--with both the threat of nuclear war on the horizon, and as AI technology encroaches with its own theory. The film never judges, which enables the audience to judge. It's so careful in its build-up, and so rapid in its pace, that it never feels slow--or rather, its slowness feels purposeful.Nolan loves to repeat lines in his films, like refrains. In The Prestige it's the line about love, where a character asks if a woman loves him, and she says: ""Not today."" In Inception, it's the lines Leo and Marion say on the train tracks. There are many other examples scattered about Nolan's filmography. Here, we get a number of repetitions that never feel contrived. We do sometimes get historical figures speaking in more of an artsy, ""foreshadowy"" register that real people don't use: ""You see outside the world we know, Oppenheimer""; ""Don't alienate the scientists in case you need them, Oppenheimer"" (which, spoiler, he does); ""You are an American Prometheus who gave them the ability to destroy themselves"", etc. But I'm more than willing to look past this atificiality because the film does so many other things so well--like the repeated scenes with Einstein. They, to me, give order to Oppie's life as the movie portrays it, and they lead to a beautiful ending that really makes the film for me. I'll probably see it again before it goes out of theatres.The film is something only Nolan could make, and I love the ways it's a Nolan film, but better than any Nolan film that's come before. Not only is it a great story told so skillfully--but it's also an example of the evolution of an artist I truly admire. Nolan made theory into reality. So did Oppenheimer. And the marriage is fascinating to contemplate--both for its successes and its flaws.I've felt the movies lacking in reality recently (like MI7, Indiana Jones, and certainly Barbie). Sure, I could go sit under a tree for a while if I want a dose of reality, but I'd probably spend the time making up some idiotic theory anyway."
"Nolan has truly outdone himself with ""Oppenheimer,"" proving that his previous works like Dunkirk, Tenet, and Interstellar were merely warm-ups for this three-hour, R-rated, adult drama filled with intense dialogue. It's a nostalgic throwback to the time when Hollywood used to create such thought-provoking movies. This might even be the last of its kind, or perhaps studios will learn from the underwhelming summer movie slate and start taking more risks instead of sticking to formulaic focus-group-approved films.""Oppenheimer"" delves into mankind's relentless pursuit of technology to better our lives, only to discover that it may ultimately be the thing that leads to our downfall. The timely comparison with AI adds an extra layer of intrigue. Unlike his previous mind-bending film, Tenet, Nolan keeps the plot more straightforward here, but he still plays with timelines to keep us on our toes. However, if you're not familiar with the historical context, some of the fast-paced dialogues may fly over your head as Nolan doesn't spoon-feed the audience. Things like who was the president at the time, what were the foreign policies back then, and some technical things like isotope export to Norway. But don't worry, they're not most important things for you to enjoy this masterpiece.For those well-versed in the era, ""Oppenheimer"" feels like a riveting three-hour, 300-million-dollar documentary, providing an insider's view of the Manhattan Project and actual Senate hearings.Now, some fans may complain about the sound mix and the movie's length. True, IMAX cameras tend to record sound louder than standard ones, and Nolan's aversion to ADR (Dubbing) may lead to some sound issues where the music overshadows the dialogues, especially during IMAX-shot scenes.As for the runtime, I must say, every minute is justified in ""Oppenheimer."" Not a single scene feels unnecessary, and each line of dialogue contributes significantly to the story Nolan seeks to tell. In an age when people binge-watch eight hours of shows in a week, a three-hour immersive experience in front of an IMAX screen hardly feels long, especially when it's for what might be the best movie of the year."
"Oppenheimer is a cinematic gem that pushes the boundaries of storytelling and captivates the audience from start to finish. Cillian Murphy's exceptional portrayal of the enigmatic J. Robert Oppenheimer is nothing short of extraordinary, elevating this film to an unparalleled level of brilliance.From the moment the opening credits roll, director Christopher Nolan takes us on an unforgettable journey through the life and mind of one of history's
most complex and influential figures. The film's attention to historical accuracy and meticulous research adds a layer of authenticity that is truly commendable. Nolan's masterful direction keeps the audience on the edge of their seats, effortlessly blending drama, intrigue, and intellectual depth.Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer is awe-inspiring. With every nuanced expression and inflection, he effortlessly captures the inner turmoil and brilliance of the physicist. Murphy's ability to convey a wide range of emotions, from vulnerability to arrogance, creates a multidimensional character that is both relatable and deeply human. It's a performance that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the actor's finest."
"Oppenheimer combines both stunning visual and audio experiences! From the beginning of the movie all till the end, you can find yourself on the edge of your seat. The way Christopher Nolan is able to capture the fear in the characters is uncanny. Cilian Murphy delivers extraordinary acting and I'm sure he will be up for an Oscar nomination. The fact that there is not one single shot of CGI further proves the fact of how amazing Nolan's directing is. The movie centers around the man and not the bomb and 3 hours of runtime went so fast no one actually felt it due to the grasp of the story. Thank you, Nolan, for delivering the story of the modern Prometheus in such a way!"
"I'm sure you can read detailed reviews everywhere stating what's good about this movies. I'm here to state the negatives: NONE !!This is as close to perfect as you can get in film making. Casting is perfect, acting is perfect, storytelling is amazing, the non-CGI special effects and music are incredible.It is not a political statement with no agenda. It just draws the viewer in and raises real life questions and moral dilemmas. It doesn't tell the viewer what to think but makes them think!Also, the physics are spot on (the scenes with Oppenheimer and Einstein...I got goosebumps)!Simply put, it's an experience, best experienced in IMAX."
"Kuch khas nahi hai bomb hota hai fat jata hai bich me angrez bolte rhete haiIt's just a meme incase you don't know
jokes apart it's christophar nolan movie,
He is GOAT ( GREAT OF ALL TIME )
literally masterpiece i really loved and enjoy this movie awesome cinematography
And storytelling part by part he is always unique in storytelling I love this experience while watching at Inox just beleive me and cancel your all plans which (if it's not important don't cancel job interview or your marriage) and go and watch this movie you will thank me later it's probably the best 500 rs you have ever spend."
"Where do i even begin with this movie! This is one of the many examples of nolan being what he does best, a director. I do recommend that before watching this film the viewer should do a small amount of research however so they could understand the exact meanings of the historical event. I was quite confused at first on why Nolan recommended this film to be on IMAX but when I watched the film i truly understood why. The environment that surrounds you makes you truly feel that you are part of the story, and that you are really looking at J. Robert Oppenheimer. Cillian Murphy being Oppenheimer is the best choice for this film. Bravo Chris!"
"OPPENHEIMER, starring Cillian Murphy and directed by Christopher Nolan, is definitely a treat for history buffs, but this film in particular is about the origins and/or the summarized development of the atomic bomb and therefore everything that shall come after, but really this film explores majorly the psychological turmoil of its subject: Oppenheimer himself, all during an age of McCarthyism and quote-on-quote government-sponsored censorship of not only entertainment, but political dissent. Blacklisting, Defamation of Character, Violation of Civil Liberties. Only Objection: Too Long, 3Hours. Pacing in On-Point for an Educated Audience. Not for the Lowest Common Denominator. Still Accessible - Acting Onpoint - Traditionalist Through and Through. This is What Keeps It Going - Straight Dramatic, Eye Contact - Cunning, Thrilling, and Mysterious At Times and Selectively Downright Philosophical. END OF REVIEW."
"While I was initially disappointed by 'Oppenheimer's' departure from Nolan's signature fantasy time-travel themes, it's still a great movie.'Oppenheimer' delivers an impressive portrayal of a true story. The film excels in its storytelling, compelling acting performances, and captivating cinematography that deftly plays with light and darkness, all while embracing a distinct 1940s aesthetic. The seamless integration of visual effects and music enhances the overall experience, effectively building suspense that had me on the edge of my seat. Moments of humor artfully contribute to a well-rounded emotional journey.However, similar to Nolan's past work, like 'Tenet,' there were instances where the dialogue proved challenging to discern, highlighting the need for improved audio clarity. While the commitment to historical accuracy is commendable, there is a noticeable lack of diversity among the cast. Additionally, certain instances of nudity felt gratuitous and could have been omitted without diminishing the story's impact.In summary, 'Oppenheimer' shines through its compelling storytelling, stunning visuals, and skillful suspense-building, despite minor setbacks."
"As a fervent devotee of Christopher Nolan's remarkable filmography, I found myself regrettably disenchanted by his latest venture, ""Oppenheimer."" My cinematic palate is one that appreciates complexity and richness, nurtured by Nolan's previous masterpieces like ""Interstellar"" and ""Inception.""Yet, ""Oppenheimer"" disappointingly fell short in maintaining this high standard. An incessant, omnipresent soundtrack seemed to overwhelm every scene, making it feel more like an extended movie trailer than an immersive experience. The heavy-handed attempt to force emotions felt like overindulgence, akin to a chef excessively using truffles in every dish.The narrative structure, another signature of Nolan, felt inappropriately forced in this biographical context. An attempt at sophistication through multiple timelines - a technique that worked brilliantly in ""Inception"" - felt unnecessarily convoluted in this setting.The dialogue, unfortunately, resonated with clichés and lacked the depth required to build emotional ties with the characters. The ceaseless time and character shifts added confusion rather than clarity, often making it difficult to follow the narrative.However, it wasn't all disappointing. The film's saving graces were the stunning cinematography and impressive performances, reflecting Nolan's enduring visual style and his knack for extracting great performances from his actors. But overall, the film did not live up to the expectations, making me wish for the measured and patient storytelling of ""Dunkirk.""In summary, ""Oppenheimer"" came off as an ambitious attempt that unfortunately missed the mark. Despite its impressive visual style and acting, the film felt more like a prolonged trailer than a satisfying, immersive Nolan experience."
"I just watched this movie, and it is an ambitious film in portraying Robert Oppenheimer. The cast which you may know were in the movie and some you didn't know had small roles were all excellent. I thought Murphy and RDJ were the standouts. The one role who I thought seemed superfluous was Florence Pugh's character. To me she didn't seem too vital to the story aside from seeing her boobs in IMAX. Nolan could've put anyone in that role, and it would have had the same superficial effect. Aside from that the only quibble I have is the score is sometimes so loud that I could NOT understand what some of the characters were saying. As for the rest of the film it was relentless in telling Oppenheimer's story. It was as well made as cinema can get nowadays. You were absolutely immersed in the mid to late 40's . So much so that if you aren't a person even mildly knowledgeable about the subject then you may get lost as this film does not hold your hand in explaining what is occurring."
"This is not possible without Nolan's previous projects. The non-linear storytelling, the thunderous score reverberating the tension. The storytelling being told masterfully via the cinematography. The sound design calculatingly setting the tone. Those techniques have been refined for a razor sharp 3 hour bio of one of mankind's most important/ awful creations. The more you come in with knowledge of the events, the more you'll get out of it. And still a great entry point for those who want a kinetic re-telling of of a complex subject.It's not a definitive account of what happened. Only journalistic & historical accounts can expand on each person's viewpoint & experience. This is mostly Oppenheimer's viewpoint. The tension, complexity & foresight he was burdened with having; all captured into the art form we love most. The collaborative acting talent enhances each performance to the stratosphere. It's so rare for a story like this to be told on this scale. A gem."
"I don't think there will ever be a greater film experience than this. You get what you give. Give this movie your absolute focus (maybe eat an edible prior), and you will be impacted by this movie in a way you never have before. You will leave the theater certain that Oppenheimer will likely never be surpassed in terms of quality. I loved it on Imax and I hope the Imax brand can stay true to a collection of movies displayed on it that are at the top of the class in cinematography and an provide interesting historical events or insight into what our world and universe have to offer. Don't miss this in Imax (also sit a little further back than the middle;)"
"""Oppenheimer"" is the ultimate cinematic triumph, that finally showcased on a global scale the incredible talent of Cillian Murphy! Murphy's captivating portrayal is nothing short of mesmerising, perfectly capturing the depth and complexity of the character with unmatched nuance.Nolan's masterful storytelling and visually stunning sequences elevate the film to a level of unparalleled brilliance. ""Oppenheimer"" explores in a unique way the historical significance of the Manhattan Project but also delves into the intricate human emotions and morals that shaped this pivotal moment in history.With its truly impeccable performances, breathtaking visuals and thought provoking narrative. ""Oppenheimer"" solidifies itself as a true cinematic masterpiece in Nolan's illustrious career!"
"Oppenheimer is based on a real story but that story is so well produced in the movie that it almost feel like a sci-fi. One characteristic that Nolan movies usually have is that they are high paced and really pulls you right in. His movies are usually very long but they don't feel like they are when they are exciting the entire time, and how he managed to pull it off in a 3 hour long real story is really why this should be considered a masterpiece.I have now watched almost every Nolan movie from Memento to Oppenheimer and I can without doubt say that its one of his best. Of course he's a great SCI-FI director but this is different just like Dunkirk was before and it makes you wonder what genre he'll do next because his storytelling is on another level.A Director is nothing without his crew and I want to point out how well the casting of this movie is. You could argue that he's lucky to have this many great actors working for him but to pick an actor like Robert Downey Jr for this role really shows you how well Nolan and his casting director knows about actors considering that he has mostly played heroes in movies. Cillian Murphy is probably doing one of the greatest acts in movie history and he should win the Oscar no doubt. It wouldn't surprise me if Robert Downey Jr gets one too for best supporting act but his screen time might be just slightly too limited."
"Wow, what a monumental & sensational film! Nolan reinvents the three-Act structure to extraordinary effect. Oppenheimer is an intense and thrilling film that grabs a hold of your attention from the first frame and never let's you go. A mesmerising and powerful drama that unfolds like a thriller; Nolan builds the tension to a breathtaking climax, but thereafter does not let go, when it morphs into a thrilling and tense courtroom drama. The performances are all uniformly incredible, but Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Junior, Emily Blunt and Jason Clarke are the clear standouts. Every performance is a fully realised characterisation. Nolan has crafted a masterful film with the highest technical achievement, from the cinematography, to the production design, to the film's epic and haunting score from Ludwig Gorranson. This is Nolan's masterpiece!"
"This movie is not what we all have been conditioned to through DC and Marvel movies. Therefore , I urge you not to listen to the haters. Nolan truly takes us through a journey of Oppenheimers life. One can expect to go through various emotions while watching this movie. The cinematography was excellent and acting by all actors was brilliant. The movie does have some technical words from physics that may be tough for some to understand. Especially those who have a small attention span. In an era of tik tok, reels and short movies with lots of action, Nolan makes a movie that demands your attention and it doesn't feel too long. It's brilliant. I want to Thank Christopher Nolan for giving us the masterpiece. We are truly witnessing a genius at work. I am also thankful to all the actors for their brilliant performance."
This is Christopher Nolan's terrific Excellent gripping intense movie to Date despite the 3 hour runtime this movie flew by very quickly Cillian Murphy is excellent in the role of Robert J Oppenheimer I really hope he gets nominated for the Oscars for best actor also Robert Downey jr Is fantastic in this movie as well Matt Damon is incredible in this movie also Kenneth Branagh is great in movie Emily blunt is also great in this film go see this movie on the biggest screen you can go watch this movie in IMAX Or IMAX 70mm this is the best movie of 2023 this film is my number 1 favourite Nolan movie after Dunkirk.
"So, finally after all the hype and all the reviews
(Positive and negative), I saw Oppenheimer today at the Leicester Square Cineworld IMAX.Nice big screen. Trailers for forthcoming films very poor. I remember the days when trailers got me excited to watch a film. Not today. Cinema was very cold, glad I wore a jumper.I'm not a Nolan fanboy but I've seen all his movies except Tenet and three of them I paid to see at the cinema and I don't go to the cinema often. It would have to be something special to get me out of my house and in a cinema these days and for me, a Nolan movie above anyone else today qualifies that condition. He consistently makes interesting AND entertaining films, so....So, the start of the film was extremely promising. I felt moved, literally due to the combination of the immense rumbling of the sound and the images of space and stars and nuclear explosions etc. I actually got goosebumps and thought 'this is exactly what I want when I go to the movies. I want goosebumps.'I loved how Nolan reminds us that this is a film about ideas, not mathematics. Einstein and Oppenheimer were not mathematicians, Einstein had to seek help from mathematicians to express his ideas in the language of mathematics. Mathematics is a useful language but ideas are what will save the human race if we are to be saved at all.I have to say, if you have little to no interest in science or the history of science a lot of the name checks are going to go over your head. A lot of satisfaction was gained by actually understanding who these people were they were talking about. I mean, 'oh thank goodness I know who they're talking about.'Yes, the cinematography is beautiful but at a budget of £100 million it had better be. Yes, Cillian Murphy is excellent - I totally believed he was a theoretical physicist which is no small feat. Yes, it's long, but I didn't check my watch until two hours in and I never felt bored.The sex scene complaint I think was unwarranted. It wasn't that bad or shocking. Although I agree it wasn't entirely necessary in an interrogation room although I understand it lent a surreal flavour to the story.The cameos I hardly noticed to be honest. There was Remi Malik who did an okay job but it wasn't overkill as others are saying. I do think Matt Damon was out of his depth in that role. Someone with real depth ad gravitas was what was needed there and I don't think he has that as an actor yet. Also Josh Hartnett felt out of his depth playing an intellectual- I didn't buy it. Tom Conti as Einstein did feel a little odd but Einstein has been parodied so much I can't see how else you could play him. Emily Blunt was great as usual.As far as the sound drowning out dialogue complaints go, I didn't have a problem with it so either I got lucky but I also wasn't too bothered if I missed some dialogue because a lot of this film is about the feels and those goosebumps I mentioned which the film has plenty of. I hope that translated to non-IMAX cinemas because a lot of this was done through sound and score. Again, I had no problem with that almost-continuous score which reminded me of PT Anderson's Magnolia which has this underlying tension playing almost non-stop throughout. Loved that!Overall, I'm glad I saw it but the true test of a great film is, would I watch it again? And this is what makes it a 7-8 film because I'm not sure that I would. I'm not sure there is a story in there that warrants a return visit but I could be wrong. I absolutely hated Magnolia the first time around whereas now it's one of my favourite films.So for now it's a 7 from me. You can safely ignore the one star reviewers. Christopher Nolan does not do one star movies."
"I'll begin by saying Oppenheimer is technically very impressive (cinematography, acting, sound, etc.). Absolutely top notch Nolan on display as always. Where the movie distinctly falls short, however, is the sheer uncompromising amount of *stuff* the movie wants to tell you.The film is about Oppenheimer's initial days as a physicist, and the early discovery of nuclear fission, and Oppenheimer's role setting up Los Alamos, and the preparation for/execution of the trinity test, and the infiltration of Los Alamos by soviet spies, and Oppenheimer's personal ethical considerations over the bomb's use, and Oppenheimer's personal shortcomings with regards to womanising/arrogance, and Oppenheimer's investigation post-WW2 regarding possible communist links, and Robert Downer Jr.'s character's dislike of Oppenheimer and attempts to get himself instated on the board of some form of senate comittee at the expense of Oppenheimer's career (yeah I also thought that was a little shoe-horned in there). There's just sooo much content; everything's rushed to cut down the runtime, and no moments get time to breathe.If you're dead-set on telling the Oppenheimer story then maybe focus on part of it and give it time to shine. Either tell the 'what Oppenheimer did' story (the setting up of Los Alamos and the creation of the atomic bomb) or the 'how Oppenheimer felt' story (his reactions to the bomb, ethical conundrums, and how those things affected his life after WW2).Or, I dunno, maybe just focus on the actual Manhattan Project? To somewhat paraphrase the old scriptwriting adage - 'Is this the most interesting part of your war-bomb story? If not, why aren't you focusing us that?'"
"Perfect literally perfect , the famous oppenheimer speech was done so good by Nolan/Cillian Murphy and this movie is not good its a masterpiece that should be no only Oscar winning but best film ever award.if u haven't watched this and ur reading these reviews just know this is a massive loss if u don't watch this in imax or cinema alone , I rarely go cinema but this was a must and such brilliant actors in it , build up was perfect ending was perfect and the bomb well wow never experienced a heart attack until that moment I was so nervous when I was counting down and when I went off wow I was so worried and scared and wow what a film , watch now!!!!!!!- Jack wing."
From the moment the movie started it set a tone which got the viewers ready for a new level of cinema. This movie will be known for changing cinema in a good way.I usually don't write reviews so for me to actually make a review and post it shows the level of detail this movie has on the audience. This movie was made for the cinema theatres making it a unique experience in cinema. This movie will be labelled as one of the all time greats by a generation cast and director. Cillian Murphy for the Oscar with this movie being the best for the year with nothing coming close to the level of detail.
"One of the most significant movies ever made.This movie takes you on a journey through the scientific advancement and devastation man has created.With fantastic individual performance from RDJ and Murphy, you will be transported into a world of both science, politics and culture.Nolan also provides a cinematic masterpiece, with some of the best audio I have ever heard in a movie.This movie handles issues which have plagued the world since WW2 and holds relevant today.I have never been so mesmerised and terrified all at once.My only criticism is that the movie was around 30 minutes to long.The quote of ""Now I Am Become Death, The Destroyer Of Worlds"" is so poinient and provides the premise of the movie."
"Nolan's Oppenheimer (2023) is astonishing as it is confrontational about humanity's folly. Everyone who knows the background of these historical events would be looking forward to how the a-bomb was created, and the explosion. But what I saw the inner turmoil of brilliant mind in the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer / Oppie.Favorite moments in the film:When Oppie (as a student) meets Niels Bohr, and Bohr gives an amazing piece of advice: ""The important thing isn't can you read music, it's can you hear it. Can you hear the music, Robert?"" When we endeavor to do something, it is not that we have to skillful immediately. It is not about the ability to do, it is having the heart, the desire to pursue and perfect it.Really like seeing pieces of literature that Oppie read, like the reference to John Donne's Holy Sonnet 14, and especially when there was a shot of T. S. Eliot's ""The Wasteland"" - this is one of my favorite pieces of literature ever, and Eliot one of my favorite poets. He would later write ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"" (one of my favorite poems about the psyche of the modern man, it is simply eloquent and positively unnerving), is a great echo of the life of Oppenheimer.When Einstein told Oppie that the Manhattan Project/fighting WW2 was his generation's fight. - ""Robert, this is not mine, it's yours."" Einstein was someone Oppie sought advise from, and during this time wherein he had to make a great decision, Einstein's response was for him to rise up. A Moses-Joshua moment.In a scene in Los Alamos, Oppie dons a military garb, to which one of his senior colleagues, Isidor Rabi, tells him to change out of it. ""They need us for who we are, so be yourself... only better."" The scene reminded me of David going to battle against Goliath as who he was-- a shepherd. And like David, Oppie defeated his Goliath - however, with great moral turmoil.Every moment that Oppie realized the consequences of what the Manhattan Project caused. Especially the basketball court gathering (THIS WAS GUT WRETCHING) & the White House meeting. Cillian Murphy's acting was so moving, I cried just trying to comprehend the weight of the guilt he was burdening.When Oppie was waiting on Kitty before she was to testify on his behalf. And he was so assured his wife would not leave him, despite everything that he has done. And she does arrive and defends him wholeheartedly. Despite the imperfections of their relationship, that is a marriage worth emulating. Kitty (Emily Blunt) was such a fit for Oppie - she had what he lacked, they were truly help-mates. Unlike, Oppie's tumultuous relationship with Jean Tatlock, which in itself was as destructive as the a-bomb.Key takeaways:
Oppie was a brilliant mind, but he was lacking in many aspects. He was not able to do practical / laboratory work, but his thoughts and theories about space and dying stars were magnificent and terrifying. While he was good at improvising, and creating and thinking, he oddly lacked social skills. He was so consumed with theory, with his thoughts, with his imaginings. But as the film repeteadly states: ""Theory will only take you so far."" And the reality of things are more terrifying than theories.""We imagine a future, and our imaginings horrify us."" - OppenhiemerThe persecution that Oppie went through when he went against further government plans for a bigger bomb underscores the folly of geniuses - how they are lacking in understanding the wretched politics of the world. After being lauded as a hero, he is marked as a hypocrite-martyr. A scientist who created a powerful bomb- he gave humanity a weapon to destroy itself- and yet he advocates against it. Towards the end of the movie, he is confronted with the question as to why he should feel any moral conflict about a professional, scientific and technical endeavor. And you can just see the struggle for words in Oppie's eyes. It was simple: of course it is a moral dillema despite it being a straightforward scientific creation. Of course it is! Everything that happens to us and because of us on this earth is of a spiritual moral level. That is because in our very core we know that the imaginings of our mind, our soul, is just an echo of our spirit. We all have a touch of divine in us because we are created in the likeness, in the image of God. And I truly believe that the real life Oppenheimer was touched of God. And Oppie was aware of that one way or the other - he thrist for this spiritual knowledge. The site for the Little Boy bomb test was named by Oppie as ""Trinity"" after John Donne's poem about the ""three person'd God"" - Holy Sonnet 14. He had the pull towards the divine, the spiritual- towards YHWH, but he looked for it elsewhere unfortunately. Again, the tragic folly of man. This is the triumph and tragedy of J. Robert Oppenhiemer.Overall, Nolan weaves an excellent thriller that throws the question that Oppenheimer dared to answer, and had the misfortune of bearing forever the guilt sprung from it:""Do I dare
Disturb the universe?""
from T. S. Eliot's ""The Love Song of J. Alfred PrufockIt is one of the best cinematic experiences I have had to date. Found a kindred-spirit in Oppie; cried a lot. Simply Brilliant."
"This film is both interesting and fast paced for a three hour film it doesn't drag, could not recommend this film any higher and cillian Murphys performance is as good as anything I have ever seen. His character is supported well by one of the best casts in recent yrs high praise to Emily blunt and Florence Pugh ( another great role by her )
Could not seriously think of a negative part of this film instant classic.The switch between black and white to colour is such a good idea , trying so hard to write this without giving any spoilers or giving anything away
Just what a film am so impressed by Nolan again one of the best directors of our time."
"This is one of the greatest cinematic experience a person can have and it is the best movie after interstellar in my opinion the visuals are perfect the cinematography is outstanding. The acting is commendable especially the acting of Cillian Murphy and Emily blunt. The personal and professional life of Oppenheimer is portrayed beautiful. And the Mastermind behind all this Christopher Nolan again gives us a Masterpiece which will be talked about till decades. At last everyone should experience this movie and that to in cinema theaters because this movie is made for that and on a TV, laptop,mobile etc screen will not give you the perfect experience."
"I never thought I will be the person who praises the movie so much right after it's premiere. Usually I like to take my time before speaking my thoughts but the newest movie from Christopher Nolan really moved me, it moved me to the point that I created account to write this brief review.First of all,I don't have any doubts that this will be regarded as the best Nolan movie years from now, nothing comes close to it and I'm speaking this as a huge fan of his previous work.I didn't realize he movie will be so suspenseful, the music and cinematography were simply masterful and acting was phenomenal as well.Without spoiling anything I have to say that the best thing for me was the feeling of inevitable doom. The last hour of the movie might very much be best hour of any movie ever, I just can't believe how good it was."
"My brother and have been fans of Cillian Murphy since the dark knight and more recently peaky blinders. We planned to go see this months in advance. We saw it Saturday opening weekend at 1145p. Not the smartest idea considering it was 3 hours long. Ok. I came in with high expectations. It's Nolan. It's Murphy, Downey, Blunt, Damon, and much more. Listen. I couldn't stop thinking about this movie. Not just the historical significance but its brilliance as well. I was blown away. I forgot about the time. A cinematic masterpiece. In a world full of superhero films and over the top CGI. I needed this. So good. I really enjoy the little gestures of each character and the little bread crumbs Nolan leaves throughout the film that round it out in the end. At one point I was sad thinking the movie was over and then upon glancing at the time realized there was an hour left. The best was yet to come."
"I love Christopher Nolan and Cillian Murphy, plus I'm a physics nerd so I was looking forward to this movie more than any other in recent memory. Interstellar is my favorite movie of all time partially because the focus on science, namely quantum mechanics and general relativity (and our inability to rectify them).Oppenheimer barely dips a toe in the water regarding quantum mechanics. There are a few moments when I thought they were about to talk about physics, but they turn into a single comment (light is both a wave and a particle) and then move on.""Oppe"" is portrayed as an emotionally fragile weakling with very limited ability in his profession, and his main talent is just managing people and the project. I don't feel this is an accurate portrayal because he truly was a prolific physics mind. The film meanders through his life with flashbacks and the opposing perspective of Strauss. It's mostly historically accurate with some annoying BS sprinkled in, such as when Oppe asks Einstein to check Teller's calculations on starting an unstoppable nuclear reaction.The first half of the movie is quite good and then after they test the bomb it started to go downhill.I had never heard of Benny Safdie (who plays Teller) before so I'm not sure if his face is always wet due to a medical condition or if something about his character necessitated this. Either way, it was weird.Jason Clark seemed to be overacting a bit. He was so angry and loud during his interrogation of Oppenheimer and it didn't add anything to the film. If I was watching at home I would have cut the volume in half to endure it.Overall Oppenheimer is portrayed as fairly unlikeable, and the amount of animosity Strauss has for him doesn't make sense. Strauss is unlikable too so I found myself thinking ""who cares"" throughout most of the second half of the movie. Who cares if his Oppenheimer's security clearance gets renewed or not? Who cares if Strauss gets confirmed in his new position? After enduring 3 hours of this I wouldn't have cared if they both got hit by a car."
"I was so hyped for this film as I briefly lived in Los Alamos, New Mexico and have family involved in the US nuclear projects of the past. Seeing it today was an incredible letdown. I don't even know where to begin with the mess of this film.Let's see, there was little to no mention of Richard Feynman. Having read Surely You're Joking, Dr. Feynman, a book which covered a lot of this project, I figured he would have at least been mentioned in the movie. But all I saw was a brief showing of someone who I assume was supposed to be him, playing the bongo drums during one scene.Then there was the dialogue. I have some hearing loss, but can understand most movies relatively well. The dialogue of this movie was so muddled and almost impossible to hear a lot of over the constant overly dramatic string music at nearly every scene! Do we really need this dramatic music at nearly every scene in a very long movie like this? I recall previous Nolan movies had the same issue. But this one seemed much worse to me. There were several other irritating audio moments as well, involving two out of place, loud, repetitive banging sounds where my girlfriend had to hold her ears.Beyond that, they left out the Enola Gay, the bombing of Japan, lots of science of the making of the bomb, and the list goes on and on. Most of this movie was just showing how Oppenheimer was being accused of being a communist over and over and over and over with this awful, overly dramatic music drowning out the dialogue. It was truly a torturous mental experience watching this.Then there was the wife. My girlfriend came to me laughing after the movie asking what was wrong with her, as she seemed so angry in nearly every scene. She didn't want to take care of the kids, and was an overly emotional, crying mess in almost every scene. I don't know what Mrs. Oppenheimer was like in real life, but I can't imagine it was anything nearly a large mess as this character was in the film.I don't like giving out 1/10s, and I almost never do it. But this film truly deserves it."
"Wednesday, July the 19th. Opening night in Paris. The audience exits the crowded room in dead silence, having witnessed yet another masterpiece from the director who doesn't require any introduction. While being so typically Nolan, Oppenheimer also separates itself from the rest of his filmography. No Tenet-like action sequences, no mind-bending elements, no confusing timeline. The movie unfolds slowly but surely, and the 3 hours go by without being felt. The final hour in particular, might just be the best I've witnessed in a long time.As for the actors, the performances are as stellar as you could expect and probably have already heard. Cillian Murphy does an Oscar-worthy job at portraying a brilliant yet troubled Robert Oppenheimer, RDJ is (for the better) unrecognizable and delivers probably the most subtle and complex performance of his career. Emily Blunt oscillates between vulnerability and strengh masterfully, and the rest of the star-studded cast does an equally amazing job.When it comes to the soundtrack, Ludwig Goransson's work is superb. Powerful at times, it can also be very subtle, almost fading into the background noises. But when it comes back at the front of the stage, it will give the viewer goosebumps and sink him into Oppenheimer's internal struggle.Hindsight might be needed in order to properly judge this film, but it is my opinion right now that only The Prestige and Interstellar (maybe) surpass it in Nolan's work."
"Having just returned from the cinema, I am left speechless by the brilliance of 'Oppenheimer,' and I must say that Cillian's performance as the lead actor is truly outstanding. This movie has transported me to another dimension with its powerful and impactful scenes. It is undoubtedly the best movie I have ever seen, and Cillian's portrayal adds an exceptional depth to the film. Cillian's portrayal of the character was nothing short of mesmerizing, leaving a lasting impression on my mind. The movie's ability to evoke such intense emotions is a testament to its brilliance. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking an unforgettable cinematic experience."
"This movie was absolutely fantastic. Quick paced. The score was powerful and emotional. Acting was exceptional. The last 45 mins were a bit much for me, so I'll take away a star for that. Also the nudity was unnecessary. You could have communicated the romantic tension without it, so I remove a star for that as well. Doing a little research on the biography of Oppenheimer afterwards, I believe the movie was very faithful to his character and personal life. Over all, I believe Christopher Nolan's film was a masterpiece that will always be remembered positively. As long as that movie was, I can't wait to see it again."
"This movie starts off very much like any other Chris Nolan film. The first 30 minutes are nothing more than rapid fire scenes bunched together introducing the main characters. I'm not gonna lie...I was immediately aggravated with the typical Nolan style introduction. ""Here we go...this is nothing more than The Dark Knight style editing mixed in with the same boring ass score."" And honestly...thats pretty much what it is for the entirety of the 3 hour run time.BUTIf you can hold on, which I assume you will...you are definitely in for a treat. This film took me on a ride. With the brilliant blue eyed Cillian Murphy at the lead, the performances all around are astounding. Everyone is at the top of their game (Except for Damon) which I think completely ruins this epic. Much like Interstellar, I think the introduction of Matt Damon just takes away from the ""believeabilty"" of what is actually happening. Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of Damon, but as of late I am really starting to think he cannot sustain a supporting role. Maybe it's just me...but this was the one thing that took me out of the movie. I think this role should have went to an older actor. Am I wrong in thinking Tommy Lee Jones or maybe even Denzel would have been better in this?? Or seriously...am I alone in thinking Josh Brolin would have killed this??? Yea, I know he's not older, but for real...he would have been great.I had no knowledge of the story of the creation of the Atom bomb going into this, so 100% based on that...I absolutely Loved this story. I immediately got home and started researching more about it.As far as recent Nolan films go, which I have not been the biggest fan (Dunkirk was fine) I think this will go down as one of his best. It can sit right along with The Dark Knight and Memento in my book.9/10."
The feeling that this is a historical event is well renowned in this movie. Nolan did not leave a bit of error in this. I movie is bold and quite intense. You not only see the history but also the truth that Oppenheimer realises about his deads. And also how each of his close friends and family were involved with him...............................................................................................
"""Oppenheimer"" is an absolute masterpiece that captivates and educates its audience on multiple levels. With exceptional direction and an outstanding ensemble cast, it brings to life the complex story of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the creation of the atomic bomb. The film seamlessly blends historical accuracy with powerful storytelling, leaving viewers in awe of the scientific and moral dilemmas faced during that era. Every frame is a visual delight, meticulously crafted to transport us back in time. ""Oppenheimer"" deserves nothing less than a perfect 10/10 rating for its compelling narrative, exceptional performances, and its thought-provoking exploration of humanity's pursuit of knowledge and its consequences. A must-watch for history enthusiasts, science lovers, and film connoisseurs alike."
"What a masterpiece... Everything designed by Nolan without CGI. You know when a movie directing by Christopher Nolan,you gotta see that movie on IMAX that's an unwritten rule and I can easily say this was the best IMAX experience that i've ever had. The quality of sounds was made me feel like I'm inside of the movie. Especially,this cast OMG! Even the less important role in the movie was played by an actor who has at least Oscar or any award. Probably only Nolan or Tarantino would bring them together and seeing this movie,learning all kinda things about the facts in the history was an indescribable experience."
"Magnum Opus! Is the word and feel that comes when you are watching this film. I am very grateful for having the opportunity to cherish this epic film by Christopher Nolan. It is grand - it is cinema at its finest. This film is one of the most important ones as it directly affects and influences our lives. It is about the man who gave the world the power to destroy itself!For the unversed, there are certain standards that Nolan always meets in his films- one of the biggest out of these standards is his nonlinear way of storytelling. He has always advocated for a nonlinear timeline in all of his films and Oppenheimer is no exception despite having a straightforward story (since it is kept true to history). The nonlinear form of screenplay can confuse a lot of people but for me it is a true mastery in the art of film making and demands full attention from the audience. This is an idiosyncrasy in Nolan's films. The second standard of Nolan (that I will talk later in the review about) is the use of practical effects and completely rejecting the use of CGI or keeping it as minimal as possible.The film was very fast paced. Despite having a 3-hour long runtime, it felt just like a 90 mins film and that is quite impressive. It takes you away for a ride. Massive respect for Nolan for sticking to the runtime and not cutting it down as many producers are very wary of longer runtimes. Jennifer Lame has become my favorite editor lately. The way she edited this movie and also the most complex Nolan film - tenet is extra ordinary. Despite having a nonlinear screenplay, the film makes complete sense at the end. And this is the beauty of the way of writing - it keeps you engaged till the very end. The way Nolan kept a mystery till the very end of a biopic based on historic facts is out of the world. This is why Nolan is one of the greatest because only he can do something like that. The ending of this film is one of the best I have ever seen and completely moved me to tears.The film delivers on every level. The acting is astounding. The ensemble cast did this movie justice. Everyone was in their A game. Cillian Murphy gave one of his best performances and I have no doubts about him getting an Oscar for this. I would specifically highlight Robert Downey Jr. Oh! Goodness! What a treat it was to watch him play the character of Lewis Strauss. His performance blew away my mind. You will all realize this once you watch the movie. Supporting cast consisting of Matt Demon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek were all exceptional. Josh Hartnett was a ditto carbon copy of Ernest Lawrence. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is clinical. He always delivers despite whatever challenges Nolan puts in front of him. He has a vision of his own that totally reflects in the film.The subject matter of this film is very sensitive. It beautifully dissects the mind of extreme genius and consequently reveals its flaws. That was the whole point of this film. This film differentiates between what it is to theorize something in the safety of your minds and how that thing eventually comes out in practice in the real world. Even geniuses have flaws. What a person intends and what is actually derived from it can be skewed in a world of manipulators. The ego of people and the sadness and dread of understanding the governance of the world sends chills down the spine. There is literal chaos and insanity out there.This film is as much political as much as it is scientific - that is the true nature of almost all scientific advances in the 20th century. This movie depicts reality and the reality is sad. It has very few creative liberties. Ludwig Görransson delivers magnificent scores for the film that depicts true dismalness of the story. It is not a cheerful one. It imbibes anxiety, fear and confusion and that is exactly what this film demanded. My favorite track that stuck with me is ""can you hear the music?"" - this piece of work absolutely depicts the essence of a scientist's unique way of thinking in a very hopeful way.The film is perfect. It is grand and I loved every second of it. The explosion, which was recreated practically and no CGI was used, was astounding and the realism it portrayed cannot be matched with CGI. The scenes where Oppenheimer was envisaging his theories was depicted perfectly. That is exactly how a great scientific mind works. It works on a completely different level. The way Nolan kept a mystery till the end is mind blowing. Each and every thing that Einstein said was deeply profound. And the ending where Einstein's and Oppenheimer's exchange is revealed blows this film completely out of the park! That was extremely scary and contemplative. That was sheer brilliance from Christopher Nolan and that is why I love him. I cherish his work. He is a maestro! And this movie left me devastated, which is exactly what Nolan wanted!A true masterpiece. The greatest film ever made! - 10/10."
"'Oppenheimer' is indeed an intriguing movie with a constellation of A-list actors all delivering stellar performances. The title is aptly chosen as it is primarily a biopic that intricately charts Oppenheimer's life trajectory. It delves into his early interests in quantum mechanics, the genesis of the idea to create a bomb, his struggle for inclusion in the program due to his affiliations, and the painstaking process of assembling a team to actualize the bomb. The movie also depicts the only explosion he witnessed - the Trinity Test - and emphatically highlights that he was not present in Japan during the actual bombings. Most importantly, the movie poignantly portrays his post-war change of heart and his subsequent fight against the further development of atomic weapons.Remembering that this is a biopic, not a war or science movie, is crucial when approaching 'Oppenheimer'. From this perspective, the movie indeed delivers. However, I'm rating it 6/10 rather than 10/10 due to several shortcomings.Firstly, the trailer is somewhat misleading as it gives an impression of a movie primarily about the atomic bomb rather than Oppenheimer's life. This discrepancy could potentially misguide the audience's expectations. Secondly, the runtime of the movie feels excessive. There are portions that could have been trimmed down to achieve a smoother flow without sacrificing the narrative's complexity and detail. There were times when the pacing lagged, and I found myself checking the time, which detracted from the overall experience.Thirdly, while the non-linear narrative style can be an effective tool for creating suspense and atmosphere, it can be confusing for those not well-versed in Oppenheimer's life. The lack of clear timestamps during the transitions between flashbacks and flash-forwards makes tracking the events challenging.Lastly, I think the hype surrounding the movie is somewhat overblown. Currently, it stands at a 9/10, which in my opinion, overstates the movie's overall quality. By rating it a point lower, I hope to contribute to a more accurate representation of its value.In summary, 'Oppenheimer' is a commendable biopic that could have been improved with clearer marketing, tighter editing, better chronological markers, and less hype."
"I thinknthis movie is overhyped and overrated. It is just famous because is not the Barbie one, meme culture had to pick a movie to memerize and this one was dark and serious so lets conpare it to Barbie.The first hour or so I felt like watching a movie trailer, there was always this music in the background, all short scenes and takes with poetic dialogs. That was tiering.The story was over complicated, just show stuff chronollogically, there where like 3 time sets, you can tell them apart but still.It woild have being easier if they let us know in the beginning what this trial and hearing were about.I really wanted to see the mental tourture that gives you creating an atomic bomb and knowi g that bc of you thousands of innocents died, but that was shown at the end and barelly
To me is a 5, maybe in tje future I ll watch it again to see if I change my mind."
The story itself was a disappointment for all human beings and spiritual people are living in Japan. But showing them as a hero with people that they destroy countries I don't see the point over here. And mixing it with lots of emotions that went so deep.My total conclusion for the story and people did participate on this shameful work is -1/10. Is not a hero thing from both sides.In every country and city are many heroes that they are not known now. But I assure everyone now are building the history and one day people will talk about them. That's why never down grade yourself or anyone you know.
"We all know Christopher Nolan works are the best all around the world but this movie literally crossed my expectations. It is a very long film indeed but there wasn't even one moment where i felt bored bcuz mystery was everywhere. Nolan might have put in his his best effort while making this extraordinary masterpiece.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon."
"I'm still processing how good this is man.This film was fire (Literally)Oppenheimer (2023) is an extraordinary film that captivated my senses from start to finish. This historical drama, directed by the brilliant Christopher Nolan, weaves a mesmerizing narrative that delves deep into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist whose work changed the course of history during World War II.From the moment the film begins, the audience is transported back in time to the tumultuous era of the 1940s, and Nolan's impeccable attention to detail immerses us into the historical setting effortlessly. The cinematography is awe-inspiring, and the breathtaking landscapes blend seamlessly with the authentic period settings, bringing Oppenheimer's world to life.The casting is nothing short of perfection. Cillian Murphy delivers an Oscar-worthy performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer, capturing the complexity and inner struggles of the enigmatic physicist with unparalleled depth. His portrayal is nuanced and compelling, allowing us to empathize with Oppenheimer's moral dilemmas and the burden he carries as the father of the atomic bomb.The supporting cast, including talented actors like Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, and Tom Hardy, further enriches the movie, elevating it to cinematic greatness. Each character is beautifully crafted and contributes significantly to the story's emotional weight.One of the most impressive aspects of Oppenheimer is its intelligent and thought-provoking script. Kudos to the screenwriters for expertly exploring the ethical questions surrounding scientific discoveries during wartime, the moral responsibilities of scientists, and the consequences of unleashing such powerful weaponry on the world.The film's score, composed by the incomparable Hans Zimmer, is nothing short of a symphonic masterpiece. It amplifies the emotional impact of every scene, pulling at our heartstrings and enhancing the overall experience.Christopher Nolan's direction is, without a doubt, a work of art. His ability to interweave historical events with human emotions and philosophical musings is nothing short of genius. He masterfully guides the audience through a rollercoaster of emotions, leaving us contemplating the consequences of our actions long after the credits roll.Oppenheimer is not merely a historical retelling; it's a powerful reflection on the frailty of humanity, the pursuit of knowledge, and the consequences of playing with forces beyond our comprehension. This film will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression on anyone fortunate enough to witness it on the big screen.In conclusion, Oppenheimer is an unparalleled cinematic experience that deserves every single one of its five stars. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction, outstanding performances, breathtaking cinematography, and emotional depth make this film a true masterpiece. It is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates the power of storytelling and the impact of historical events on the course of human history."
"A Masterpiece in every sense of the word, the editing and masterful score kept me invested and engaged during the whole 180 minutes.The sound kept me on my toes, and the performances are so DAMN good. Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. And Matt Damon show that they are absolute elite performers. Alden Ehrenreich was the surprise package, fantastic everytime he was on screen.The trinity test sequence is one of the best movie scenes this century, my favorite of the year.Nolan's best movie since Inception and if he doesn't win the Best Director Oscar for this, I'm afraid he will never win it, and I personally thing that would be a tragedy."
"It's by far Christopher Nolan's best work and easily the best movie released in the last 10 years. It is a little bit long coming in at 3 hours and 9 minutes, but it's worth it.It's a star studded cast that actually delivers, unlike some of the ones in the past with that many superstars in one movie. Cillian Murphy delivers an Oscar worthy performance. Robert Downing, Jr., despite playing to roll of a horrible person, gives his best acting performance to date. The fact that Florence Pugh is only in like 8 scenes just shows the star power this movie has.Overall, it is a masterpiece and a must see."
"Oppenheimer has offered the audience an outstanding story, casting, and definitely acting. Cillian Murphy and Robert D. Junior have excelled and went beyond everything they've done before, and showed everyone how great they are. The music was employed perfectly, and it was successful in heightening the emotions of every scene (kudos to Ludwig Goransson)I'm not gonna lie that I was disappointed by the small scale of the explosion (as everyone expected a more dramatic one), but in exchange, we had amazing dialogues, drama and acting!This movie is an Oscar worthy production, and it's definitely THE BEST movie of the year!"
"This movie is nothing other than perfection. The characters, the plot, cinematography, acting, all was 10/10.I've seen some reviews suggesting it was too long, but I feel like the ending wraps up the story so nicely that it makes up for the length of the movie. For me it felt more like the movie was 2,5h long because of the mesmerising ending!Some of the scenes were the best I've ever scene regarding the cinematography. The scene where Oppenheimer speaks in front of Los Alamos after the bombings was nothing short of amazing. Also the build up to the Trinity-test raised my bpm to at least 140!Would definitely recommend watching the 70mm because of Nolan's stunning Cinematography."
"It is an incredibly well done movie! It was confusing at times, just for the confusion to be an excellent catalyst for the ending. It was truly shocking!!!! I was never bored during the film, and it kind of felt like three movies in one, that thoroughly connected. The movie may not be what y'all are expecting, but it is a truly great piece of cinema. It gives great insight into the time period and the man's life. The whole movie flows seamlessly, and definitely deserves to be watched multiple times! One of the most incredible things that I realized 2/3rds of the way in, is that the actors did such an amazing job that I truly forgot it was the same actors for the majority of the movie. I truly dropped my jaw remembering that Cillian Murphy is the man planning Oppenheimer, but also played Scarecrow (in Nolan's BatMan Begins); they feel like two completely separate human beings! The only one who felt like himself was Robert Downey Jr., but that was pretty much because he was the only one who didn't have a completely different voice from his usual self. Downey Jr.'s performance was still magnificent to be clear! The whole movie is truly a masterpiece and should be remembered as an American classic!!!! I never say this, but during the last 30 seconds I had goosebumps, it was a truly, deep and meaningful, emotional experience."
"Today I watched Nolan's Oppenheimer and it was good.To start off I think that Cillian Murphy and most of the other cast did really great. I think the acting in this film is genuinely very good, most of the actors really transform into their characters, even some smaller role actors have the opportunity to show a lot of range in this film.The story is definitely my favorite part, I enjoy almost all of it and think this is one of the best tales to be told on the big screen. I think Nolan also did a good job writing a 3 hour long film without to much of it feeling like it needed to be cut out, it's not easy to do. There are a couple moments that are incredibly visceral and really make you question the philosophy of what's happening here.My huge problem with this film is the technical aspects however and there is a unfortunately a good chunk of it that I do not love. For starters, the cinematography in this film feels like a downgrade from every Nolan I've watched(haven't seen tenet).Half of this film, no, 75% of this film is just shot reverse shot close ups that are so insanely unimaginative that it really boggles my mind that they didn't just pull the camera back a little bit. Like, your sets are actually pretty neat, can you PLEASE pull the camera back from Oppy and show me the laboratory their in?? Maybe show me a bit more scenery and not a close up shot reverse shot? We did get some genuinely Jaw dropping scenes, however for the most part it just often was so bland.The cinematography also doesn't help the fact that this movie has some really adhd editing going on. So many different scenes happen and so many different characters come in so quickly that it's actually bordering on bloated. It really felt like there was like 30 cuts on average per minute in this 3 hour long film and that's just eye straining sometimes. Like we're cutting back and forth between areas and times and it's just so much information overload...Also the mixing, as per Nolan standard, renders certain scenes absolutely unintelligible on a big screen. Maybe it's fine for home video or with subtitles, but, especially near the end, some scenes the vocals are just buried in the mix so badly. I cannot hear over the music that is not normally in the scene why is it so loud...And uh yeah the music was fine, I really don't have much to say about it. I guess it serviced the film well in some parts but I found it to be generally forgettable. Like I really loved the music in some of Nolan's older works (dunkirk and memento in particular) but this particular soundtrack didn't blow me away or anything. No pun intended.Overall, I still enjoyed this movie despite what I believe to be pretty annoying flaws. It has a lot of payoffs, it's a very VERY good story and writing(barring one kinda cringe scene with Florence Pugh), and it really is fantastically acted by the main actors. I definitely do not regret watching this movie but I do wish that some elements didn't feel kinda phoned in.Low - Mid 6/10."
"The movie was too long and there were too many characters introduced. Also, the story was not told in a linear fashion, so you didn't always know what was happening. The last third and parts of the first third of the film were not really necessary. I had expected more.Acting was also rather poor, because the backgrounds of the other characters were not told, because everything was focused only on the main character Oppenheimer. So it was an impressive ensemble of actors, but all actors remained very pale in their roles. The supporting characters could have just as easily been cast by no-name actors. Cillian Murphy in the leading role was good, but not Oscar worthy.The camera wasn't good either, as there was too much focus on close-ups and too few white-angle shots.I didn't like the picture either. It was too dark and colors were barely shown.The best thing about the film was the soundtrack. It was very well nuanced and in tune with the film.In general, it can be said that biopics are not Nolan's genre. Spielberg (Schindler's List) and Scorsese (Aviator) can do that worlds better. Moreover, there are already excellent documentaries and books on the Manhattan Project."
"I though the movie was a breath air for Hollywood, all year bad movies have been pumped out, but this feels like it has heart. Unlike certain other movies, this one does not rely on bad jokes to take up most of the runtime.I very much enjoyed the fact that this film did not shy away from the repercussions of the A-Bomb, or the effects of the Bomb on Oppenheimer's life.In conclusion, this movie is will most likely be the winner, or runner up, of ""The Best Film of Summer 2023"" (behind Barbie of course) (just kidding). This film will stick with me for the rest of my life, because of the stunning Cinematography, Writing, Acting, and Directing by Christopher Nolan."
"The cinematic genius Christopher Nolan is undoubtedly one of the finest stars in the film industry. With his unique talent and boundless creativity, he has crafted a new cinematic icon (Oppenheimer) that will undoubtedly be immortalized in the world of cinema. It will stand among the greatest works ever seen in the realm of cinema because Nolan only delivers iconic masterpieces.Nolan has presented exceptional cinematic works that skillfully blend breathtaking narratives with innovative techniques. He doesn't settle for merely producing films; instead, he creates artistic creations that touch the hearts and dazzle the minds, immersing us in reality and opening new gateways to our imagination.Through his magnificent works, he sends a message to the world that cinema is not just about entertainment; it is a form of artistic expression and a medium to convey ideas and emotions in a mesmerizing and innovative manner. With his masterful direction and inspiring screenplays, he has inspired millions and deeply impacted them.Without a doubt, Nolan's creations will remain timeless, and his magnificent work will continue to influence future generations for thousands of years. He hasn't just made films; he has built an artistic legacy that will never be forgotten because he achieved a perfect balance between entertainment and artistic excellence.Forever, cinema will remember this genius who transformed movies into a stage for beautiful artistic expressions, captivating and enchanting us with its unique charm. Hats off to the prodigious Christopher Nolan, who will remain a symbol of creativity and distinction in the world of cinema for thousands of years to come!.And all of this will apply to Oppenheimer film, which will reflect all of Christopher's art in this work."
"Oppenheimer is an excellent personal history and a story of international cooperation in physics. There is an interest in philosophy and morality, but no understanding of the actions and consequences. All the time there is too much political witch hunt and game in the US and too few mentions and scenes of the effects of radiation, humanitarian crisis and suffering in Japan.The film could have used many more pictures of the victims and a reminder that nuclear power should never have been used in history and should not be used in warfare in the future, not in this decade and not in the decades to come.An apology is completely absent at state level."
"I don't think any other movie will cast this perfectly and deliver a dominating performance from each character. Nolan proved why he's one of the greatest storytellers of this generation. The Acting, Cinematography, Music, Background score, Screenplay, Direction, and everything were so perfect.No wonder Robert Downey Jr. Said this is the best movie he has been part of it, his character arc and the way he delivered in the end were amazing.Emily Blunt's character blew me away, I wasn't expected such character and acting performance from her.Cillian Murphy and Christopher Nolan carried this movie's 1st frame to last, incredibly talented people and delivered their peak skills.I wish this movie wins at least 4-5 Oscars, they all deserve that appreciation and recognization for their incredible contributions to this generation."
"I waited so long to see the film, and it was worth it. I'm a big Christopher Nolan fan and I've seen his most popular films and I had high hopes for the film.The visuals of the film were beautiful and the cinematography made the film enjoyable. However, the pace was a little slow and at times felt a little boring. Although I expected more from the film, it was still surprisingly well done.I thought the film would have been more about the atomic bombs, but the film was about Oppenheimer as the title is Oppenheimer. And don't get me wrong, i am totally fine with that. Oppenheimer is a great historical figure that everyone should know about.I highly recommend going to see the film as soon as possible and if you can then choose the imax theatre."
"Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon."
"Probably the best Nolan movie ever.The pace, the story, the acting, the music, the cinematography, the choice of format, the EMOTIONS! It all comes together perfectly.This movie deserves a 10/10. Cillian Murphy's acting is flawless. The supporting cast elevate his performance to a whole other level. This is based off history. Academics who are forced to make a weapon of mass destruction and the turmoil that comes with it. Morality, guilt and elation is all portrayed beautifully. I would love to see it again for the first time and have my mind blown all over again.This movie is a masterpiece in every way.This is film-making at its finest. Hope Nolan keeps it going and makes more films like this."
"There is a moment. Right after the detonation. We see the horrific realisation on his face in a realm of silence. The pure form of terror in its most subtle form as he understands what he has done. And just for a moment you realise along with him that the world has been changed.When the final scene finished playing and the score came to its conclusion there was a brief period of stillness throughout the audience as everyone momentarily considered what they had just witnessed. And for the first time in my cinematic experience I was just lost for words. As everyone left their seats and my dad and my friend spoke to me I just sat there pondering the meaning of it all, barely replying. And then I realised myself that I'd never been affected by a film in that way before. There are those that I have enjoyed more than this, that have brought out more emotions in me and even those that I consider better made. But the visceral experience that was. It was just phenomenal.Perhaps I have been blown away to an extent that isn't widely felt. But I think that most of us can agree that Nolan has presented us with his masterpiece no matter how it compares to his previous filmography and what we prefer or not. By placing all the elements of this film together with all the hard work so many have put into it we have been delivered something of brilliance. A hauntingly beautiful score from Ludwig Göransson which gave me chills whenever it played that masterful crescendo of power. The incredible sound design that packs an almighty punch emphasising the true power behind these horrifying creations. The alluring cinematography of Hoyte van Hoytema suitably demonstrating both claustrophobic discomfort and breath-taking pictures of art. The screenplay exhibiting the true power of words both from those spoken by real life figures and Nolan's careful hand. The performances of the cast as a whole bringing these people to the big screen in fascinating ways but most notably of Cillian Murphy and his outstanding and without a doubt Oscar-worthy take on Oppenheimer and of Robert Downey Jr reaffirming his acting prowess in the portrayal of Lewis Strauss. And finally, the considerably fantastic direction of Christopher Nolan to administer this truly wonderful experience which somehow feels like a culmination of all his work that came before.I can't say it was without flaws unfortunately. I felt at points it became a little dragged out which took me out of the experience and the editing also felt a little too choppy to the point where it was hard to follow sometimes. However, the pacing may have been from my own fault of focusing too much on the adrenaline fuelled sequences of visceral sensation preventing me from admiring the significance of the sections of lower tempo and the editing was clearly deliberate to present the chaotic nature of the reality behind this complex period in modern history.I spent a few brief instances looking around at the audience And it reminded of my love of the cinematic world. The silence as everyone is completely immersed in what we are being shown. The impossible task of tearing your eyes from the screen. The pure engagement of this new world that you have been transported to. That is what film is about.But truly, above everything, despite any of my overall opinion of entertainment or issues with the film. It was one of the greatest filmic experiences I've had and I honestly just cannot decide on how I feel about it all. It has completely thrown me.There are numerous fantastic sequences within the film but the one that stood out to me was the ending. I will not unveil what it is or does but I was so overwhelmed with pure emotion that my eyes just glistened and a tear rolled down my cheek. With one final crescendo after all the symbolism, all the visual cues, all the foreshadowing, all the exploration of humanity, the consequence of action, the power of comradery, the fear of man. Nolan brings the hammer down with a consideration of reality and what we have done.And it is terrifying."
"A very well crafted and intriguing look into the man who changed the world forever but it's not for everybody...As a fan of Nolan and of all things history, I was excited to watch a film about J Robert Oppenheimer and prepared for it not to be a typical Nolan Movie. Whilst this is masterfully created and feels great in IMAX, it's not a movie that will resonate with everybody especially those who aren't interested in the subject matter.Oppenheimer is a character study into the thoughts of the so called 'Father of the Atomic Bomb' leading up to the Manhattan project prior to when the atomic bomb was created and its aftermath when Oppenheimer had a bigger but different voice within the atomic energy scene.I enjoyed insight into the world of a Theoretical Physicist and the dynamic between the science community and that of the US Army. Whilst this isn't a science based film that goes heavy into the detail, we did get to see Oppenheimer's rise through the field and several interesting discussions with his peers. We also get an insights into his personal life. Like many geniuses, he had a few skeletons in his closet.The acting from Cillian Murphy and Robert Downy Jr was immerse as was most of the performances from the supporting cast. The sounds design was excellent and the testing of the atomic bomb was my favourite scene followed by the hearings. However my favourite part of the movie was Ludwig Goransson's dark, scientifical score. There were so many scenes where you felt the score elevating the mood or tension.This movie is not for everybody. Whilst I enjoyed the movie and was especially intrigued by how Oppenheimer was viewed by those around him. It's a three hours long dialogue heavy character piece that I wouldn't necessarily recommend to all of my friends. I didn't find it slow but there are parts that are slower than others and viewers that aren't interested in the subject matter or who miss story beats may struggle to stay on board or remain invested. Whilst this isn't my favourite Nolan film, it's masterfully made and an intriguing, insightful work into a man who changed the world forever."
"I mean I don't know what most people saw here, but this was a bore fest. Amazing cast, great acting , superb cinematography and sound. But that's about it. Except few moments in the movie, rest was complete borefest. Half my theater was sleeping after 45 minutes. Werner Brothers might buy some reviewers to give great reviews and Nolan fan boys might go ga ga over it,.but that's usual with most of his movies. Box office, it won't last over few days.I mean majority history of the atomic bomb was left put. The challenges with the actual science, material, building up those towns , the race for the bomb . Nothing. All interesting things were left put and the movie focuses on boring tale of oppenheimers trial. Seriously. You missed the most interesting part of that history."
"Christopher Nolan depicts an epic biopic of the life of Oppenheimer. There isn't a single flaw with this movie. The pacing is perfect, with the use of time jumps Nolan provides an entertaining look into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer. The artistic use of black, white and color gives the viewer two different perspectives on the movie. The acting performances from Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey jr and the entire supporting cast are nothing short of exceptional and just go to show that Nolan's casting is perfect. Once again Nolan has proven he is not limited by genre by making his best work. Truly a masterpiece, I expect it will pick up various awards as what I believe to be movie of the year."
"From the direction of Christopher Nolan. To the amazing soundtrack that makes every intense scene get you on the edge of your seat. To the beautiful acting of Cillian Murphy, and Robert Downey Jr., and Matt Damon, and Emily Blunt, and so many more. When I went to the theater watching this film, I thought in the back of my head that I knew the story and I knew the outcome. But Christopher Nolan still manages to dive deep down in reveal the story in ways I never thought. It's gonna be one of the best movies for a very long time. The only thing I can say is go out watch this movie. And do not miss a second of it because every scene and every word spoken matters. I can't wait to see what Christopher Nolan cooks up next!"
"During the Cuban missile crisis, the crew onboard B-59, one of the four Foxtrot-class Soviet submarines sent to waters around Cuba, had been out of contact with Moscow for days. Infrequently picking up civilian radio transmissions, the nuclear-armed submarine was too deep to be in sync with the outside world, to know if war had already been broke out, as it's been busy hiding from American naval pursuers. Captain Savitsky and the Political Officer Maslennikov decided to launch a nuclear torpedo, the authorization of which normally requires only the confirmations from the two officers. The launch, according to military estimates, would have caused a chain reaction, resulting in a thermonuclear conflict destroying the better parts of the northern hemisphere. With reputations preceding him, Executive Officer Vasily Arkhipov utilized the special circumstance requiring the confirmations of all three officers, objected to the launch, preventing the onset of nuclear war. Roughly 20 years later, a similar fate was averted when officer Stanislav Petrov at the command center of the Soviet early warning system Oko decided that the multiple reports of intercontinental ballistic missile launch were false alarms, disobeying military protocols requiring him to relay the alarms up the chain of command (at the likely cost of his entire life and career), otherwise leading to a retaliatory attack with unimaginable consequences.These incidents were the closest that the world has ever been to annihilation. They also weren't what this film was about. But, upon learning them, one should have a different understanding of what it was trying to say.What critics of this movie won't recognize, is that the hundred-million dollar project that puts us in the shoes of a man who can only be either likened to Prometheus, the one who brought life to humanity, or Shiva, the one who would bring it to its demise, was destined to be flawed from the get go. Christopher Nolan, who also wrote the screenplay, had a hefty burden of balancing the different aspects of the theoretical physicist's life: by design, it's bound to overemphasize the science and the politics, because one simply can not exist on its own without delving deep into the other, thereby stretching the runtime even further. Art is not about capturing the different faces of a three-dimensional solid body on a two-dimensional plane (like Descartes wrote in his Discourse). In fact, it can't. The film wasn't trying to be a biopic, laying out that special someone's life story, dramatizes his achievements and downplays the parts that don't contribute to them. Nor is it trying to be a political documentary that confronts the horrendous and grotesque realities behind these doomsday gadgets (as a matter of fact, it barely touched upon them, unlike Mick Jackson's nightmarishly-realistic Threads, a film literally everyone must see). It's only a few peeks into certain fragments of Oppenheimer's life, those that when taken together help us define his ego, his resolve, and his ordeal.It should then come as little surprise, in a three-hour long picture with seldom time to breath, with scenes literally bereaved of an opening and a closing, and with imageries and sounds designed like a ticking time bomb, that the two female supports never got the chance to develop into coherent personalities and make a lasting impression, that the experiences of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atrocities were completely glossed over. These are less flaws than byproducts of this sort of structural arrangement. Like the man himself, whose legacy is as self-contradictory as peace and armageddon, the distance between which now becomes the pluck of a single lower-rank officer, the film, being about the author behind the first atomic bomb, ipso facto fails to do justice to the humanitarian consequences of the Trinity Test, which are patently undeniable and morally complicated. Likewise, the picture, being about something with immeasurable implications which only a few could fully comprehend (much less deal with), can pay no more respect to Oppenheimer's personal life than the field equations can to Albert Einstein's acquaintance with Kurt Gödel. Given these confines that came with the material, Nolan and his team did the absolute best they could. If Memento was the proof of his editing talent, and Inception was that of his creative talent, and Dunkirk was that of his directing talent, this picture should be the proof of his audacity."
"This movie is long and mostly dialogue but the time passes by quickly. Unlike other Nolan movies, this one doesn't have any fast paced action sequences but relies on characters, dialogue and the score to drive it along. Most bad reviews on here are from people who don't have an interest in the subject matter or were looking for an action packed blockbuster.This however is a different Nolan film that is in a masterclass. I haven't seen many dialogue films that have used the score to drive along the story so well. It is booming throughout and keeps the audiences adrenaline up through the long runtime up. The fast paced change of timelines keeps viewers on their toes and engaged.As someone who believes the movie is only as good as its music I'd say this is a homerun. It must be seen in Imax or with surround sound to truly be appreciated."
"A typical Nolan film that forces the audience to have full engagement and use their head throughout the entire film to fully understand the surrounding plot. The plot is designed perfectly and depicts Oppenheimers life much more deeply than I suspected walking into the theatre. The cinematography was beautiful, as expected with Nolan. The music and theme was fantastic. The acting was absolutely phenomenal, and Nolan's ability to build each character deeply was crucial to the plot. Finally, the ending was perfect, it brought everything together and gave the audience a chilling sensation as they left the theatre with a jaw dropping experience."
"In my opinion, Nolan made an excellent movie that talks about Oppenheimer, the plot is not only about the atomic bomb, it also has to do with the Manhattan project and what happened after using the bomb, the cast is perfect, all the performances are good, but the performances by Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. And Emily Blunt are spectacular, Ludwig Göransson's soundtrack is very good, the direction and photography is impeccable, I loved that they didn't use cgi, for all those reasons it's one of my movies Nolan's favorites and they will possibly win many Oscars For example, Best Supporting Actor for Robert Downey Jr. Best Picture and the Oscar for Cillian Murphy."
"Wow, a three non-stop caprivating hours at the cinema. Fantastic acting actoss the board, especially from Cillian, Robert and Emily, they all deserve Oscar nominations.The music is tremendously captivating and Ludvig should win another Oscar for this one.As should Nolan himself for the script, the directing and the movie.Loved how the hearing and interrogation drives the movie forward in such a fast paste. The three hours felt very short.Also very interesting way of story telling to portray the the publicly available narrative and Oppenheimers personal narrative in black and white and colour respectively.Can't say which one is better, this one or Inception."
"This film is a masterpiece of Christopher Nolan.The paradox of the invention of the Atomic bomb is incredible and we can see this over the entire film.The role that Cillian Murphy played was perfect and we can see both happiness and sadness in the caracther along the movie, it deserves a Oscar award.The sound and the images in general of the film was really Nolans work, the caracthers of the movie were with a very good image.This film is all about Oppenheimer and the other caracthers are just like a accessory of the film, just his wife and strauss have a little more development.In general a great movie!"
"There is two movies inside one. The first one is a hodgepodge of events and characters with a course on quantum physics. Tough to follow and uneven. Second part is much better but Nolan makes the first nuclear blast so suspensful that you do not have the energy to follow him mentally through the rest of the movie (Another 45 min at least of Salieri-themed intrigue). Of course, its a beautiful movie with top actors but it has a problem about the general structure of the story. It does not have the narrative fluidity of a Spielberg movie. Nolan is a great master technician but watching his movies always gave me the impression that he is directing his films while admiring himself in a mirror."
"Up until Dunkirk, I loved Nolan's films. I saw Interstellar 3 times in the theater. The Dark Knight trilogy may be my favorite in the superhero genre. I had high expectations going into Oppenheimer. Sadly, I was falling asleep and checking my phone by the end of the first hour. So boring. The only thing in this film maybe worth watching only when it's available at home were the performances. Murphy and Damon mostly.Idk, I feel like all these people calling it a masterpiece are saying they like this movie because that's what they've been told to think. I don't see how anyone could've walked out of this film entertained in any sense of the word. I wanted to walk out an hour before it was over, which I can only remember doing a couple times in my life. The only reason I stayed was because my nephew wanted to see the end and I didn't want to ruin the experience for him. Thoroughly disappointed."
"This movie is near perfect. A wonderful character study/political drama that ultimately reminds us all the potential of being sent back to the Stone Age. The potential of having Nukes sent to you at any moment is akin to having a gun held to your head 24/7. What if you grow up in a society that was born with a gun to its head? It's easy to forget it's there.The movie masterfully brings to life the story based on the book, American Prometheus. I saw this movie twice and after the first time I was amazed, after the second watch I thought it was absolutely perfect!I was not only be shocked but disappointed if this doesn't take away a lot of Oscars and awards, especially Cillian Murphy!! Murphy solidified himself as one of the great actors of our generation here. The cast is star-studded and they all deliver from RDJ, Damon, Blunt, Malek, all the way to Hartnett, Peck, and Pugh.I think the only way you might not enjoy this movie is if you were either expecting this to be some intense action packed movie like Mission Impossible or even like Inception, it's not that. The political drama in the third act is as intense as you can make it!!I've seen negative reviews saying they wish they saw more Japanese people in the movie. What?...did you want to see them bombed to smithereens? Or did you want to see their atrocities, ruthlessness, and refusal to surrender that caused us to come to that we need to drop the bombs? This movie tells an amazing story and those parts to it are not necessary to be seen on screen.100/100 for me, I hope you all enjoy!"
"Christopher Nolan is BACK!!! This movie was everything that Dunkirk tried to be, but couldn't.Nolan after Oppenheimer has mastered the art of historical storytelling. Oppenheimer is fast paced, brilliantly wrote and keeps you on the edge of your seat. When the bomb finally goes off, it's one of the best moments in cinema HISTORY...Nolan captures the excitement of creation while acknowledging the very sad realities this weapon entails. While also giving a warning to our countries leaders of its extremely DANGEROUS nature.The movie doesn't revive a 10 for me because it doesn't fully capture my personal mind and heart, but I so appreciate the brilliance. Only Christopher Nolan could make science and history so FUN!!!Definitely a must see.. The nudity was a bit much for me, but the necessity of this movie to educate the world today about what we inherited from WW2 is essential for every person.9/10."
"Fantastic.......The movie is one og a kind, everything you need tp know about Oppenheimer and how his work turned out. Everything about how the nuclear idea and you get the feeling of how intense the race was. You coul see Cillian Murphy and the whole Crew worked hard on the movie, and it payed off, Cillian takes you in behind the lines of how oppenheimer thinked and how he was haunted after the bombings in Japan. RDJ makes you hate Strauss, and he takes you into a little sneak Peek of American politics.Christopher Nolan did everything right with this movie, and makes you feel death, reality and scared at the same time. Its a movie coming at the best time possible, in a time where nuclear war is beeing used without hessitating in politics. Everybody should Watch it so you could get the feeling off bring scared.The movie would get over 9,3 attleast in rating if it wasnt beeing a trend movie you go Watch without nowing any history but because of Barbenheimer... for history interested as myself it is a masterpiece."
"Just out after watching this movie. Nolan is maturing well and how. The story telling has become simpler (vis-a-vis Prestige for example :P). Has an Amadeus touch to the story line. Cinematography, lighting and camera work is superb and lends itself well to the story telling. Nolan remains customer obsessed as ever, treating his audience with intellectual respect. The actors are extremely good and the best compliment to them is that you don't feel them. Only thing which could be better was the music.Science (Quantum physics) serves as the background color of the movie but it is neither necessary or expected to understand all of it nuances to understand the movie. Don't get too bothered by the science jargons unless you are interested."
"When I had wached this movie I gave it 9/10 because of missing some details as the first half of the movie was so fast and there had been alot of names but when I rewatched it my rate is 10/10 . At the second watch I understood everything the timeline in the movie was alittle bet hard to understand but when yous see that for second time its wow . Cillian Murphy's performance deserves oscar , even his eyes was acting he was really the best cast . Robert Downey Jr. I wished he has more scenes but his scenes in the second part of the movie was really good and I forgot that I am watching Tony Stark. Mat Damon and Emily Blunt were also lovely. The most thing I have loved in the movie is the sound effects it made super atmosphere. Finally I love to say Nolan is GOAT."
"This movie will become a classic. I watched this movie in theaters and it will certainly take a while to process. Its essentially a biography of Oppenheimer's life, but with a focus on the period around the manhattan project. It was truly a very ponderous movie that presents many moral questions, especially pertaining to the the atomic bomb. The inclusion of practical effects by Christopher Nolan added levels of realism and immersion that left me feeling like I was really at the trinity test. I left the theater astounded. My only strife might be that the short nudity and sex scenes didn't really add much to the story. Overall an exceptional film."
"It is possible to combine science and politics with a very deep and catastrophic story, a very rigid and complex protagonist, and a very rich and enjoyable middle and end, despite the number of important and historical names and characters in that context to understand and not miss any detail.A masterpiece by Nolan with a perfect cast, where Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Extraordinarily highlight his talent, surprising me a little more Robert, with his acting quality at the height that this film deserves.It is a spectacular movie. A film with a very strong and dramatic context. Nolan gets almost everything right here."
"In the world of film, Christopher Nolan holds a high bar for storytelling. With 'Oppenheimer,' he once again proves why he's at the top of his game. The film is a rich tapestry of skill and creativity, leaving the audience captivated from start to finish.The direction and editing of the film play out like a master class in cinema, turning every moment into a memorable snapshot. The visual appeal of the movie, enriched by the cinematography, is a feast for the eyes, painting each scene in vibrant tones and intricate detail.The cast is a star-studded line-up of Hollywood's finest, and Nolan expertly uses their talent to add depth to the movie. Even in brief appearances, the performances shine, demonstrating the respect Nolan commands as a director.The film's claim of avoiding CGI is fascinating, leaving the audience wondering how such effects were achieved. If it's true, it puts 'Oppenheimer' in a unique spot in movie history, celebrating the power of real-world visual magic.The bomb testing scene is a high point of the movie, creating an immersive experience that outshines even the biggest blockbuster premieres. The spellbound silence of the audience was proof of the scene's impactful execution.Cillian Murphy, playing Robert J. Oppenheimer, delivers an emotionally charged performance, infusing his role with depth and pathos. Robert Downey Jr., as Lewis Strauss, gives a standout performance that's already generating Oscar buzz.While I won't spoil any more of the movie, I urge you to see 'Oppenheimer.' It's a film that grabs your attention and stays with you long after you've left the theater. Ideally, it should be experienced on the big screen, where its cinematic scope can be fully appreciated."
"I'm fully aware that critiquing the work of an auteur like Christopher Nolan could be perceived as snobbish. Hence, I'd try to be objective in this review.Firstly, it's a biopic. There's nothing quite unique about a biopic as the imaginative works of Nolan like the Inception or Interstellar. Hence, there is only so much he can do to be creative in directing Oppenheimer. It's just history, and there is nothing much to spoil there. This movie is a take on the personal predicaments and political persecution of scientist Dr. J Robert Oppenheimer who headed the Manhattan Project which resulted in the creation of the atomic bomb and as a consequence millions of innocent people lost their lives in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.Secondly, there is a known pattern of human behavior which always targets the best of us when their job is done. Meaning, eminent scientists being harassed by the system once they have achieved great success is a recurring theme. We find that in the story of Alan Turing in the Imitation Game, in the story of Nambi Narayanan in Rocketry and so many others. It is common to find scientists working on technologies of strategic importance being framed for treason or similar cases and then being questioned for their loyalty to their nation. It's simply an occupational hazard. What can I say? Never build things for the government!Thirdly, movies about American supremacy growing out of the Second World War and the subsequent cold war are stereotypical. We are quite over them. We just see them in different light now. President Truman's two bit rebuff of Oppenheimer is as asinine as it can get. It's cartoonishly evil. Perhaps it serves as the explanation of why no one ever committed suicide for being part of the decision to drop those bombs. Instead everyone just kept bickering over bruised egos for not being amply credited for the wonderful devastation which brought an end to the war.Also it feels like Nolan is showing off by bringing on-board every brilliant actor out there for minor roles and cameos. Additionally, it could be a nerd's wet dream to see the glimpse of every founding genius of particle physics being name called and paraded as part of the plot but as a student of physics myself, I'm cringing.Furthermore, the use of Bhagwat Gita reference was not given justice. The reason why Oppenheimer quoted those famous lines about becoming ""destroyer of worlds"" could have been treated better and not in a clichéd scene which could just be dismissed as some orientalist's curiosity with foreign religion. The movie didn't soak in the actual philosophy of which Oppenheimer was a keen student in real life.The idea of a scientist who created the ultimate weapon of mass destruction growing a conscience and getting punished for that is a bit of a routine drag. I think this is where Oppenheimer contrasts with Heisenberg. While Oppenheimer set aside all his personal doubts to create the atom bomb for US government knowing well that he won't have any say in its use (In-fact he was highly enthusiastic about it initially) Heisenberg and his team of scientists working on the same project for the Nazis did not show that same motivation. I believe that's where Heisenberg's character far exceeds Oppenheimer's. Let's not delve in assessing such historical giants with our current worldview.You can watch a movie called 'The Catcher was a Spy' on how USA deployed a baseball star to spy on Heisenberg to know if he's close to creating the atom bomb and if so, assassinate him. Critics didn't like the movie much. However I like it better than this.Comparing with the body of work of Nolan, Oppenheimer does not feel like his best. It's an over emphasized effort to dazzle the world with the scale of production. We are sitting on the verge of a world war III with very real threat of a nuclear annihilation and we still don't care if the world will come to an end."
"With so many high ratings, I figured this would be a really good movie, but I was disappointed. Many of the scenes are long and drawn out way beyond what they should be, and much of the movie is quite boring overall. The movie did have parts that were interesting and other scenes with a lot of tension, but they were a minority. This is a 3 hour movie, and I honestly think they could have trimmed this down to half that and made it 90 minutes and none of the story would be missed.The movie was also quite scattered, continually jumping around to different time periods which got annoying and made it a little hard to follow sometimes.I think this movie was over-hyped just because Christopher Nolan directed it. I can imagine a social experiment where this movie was released with Christopher Nolan's name concealed and instead an unknown director is listed. I'll bet in that case there wouldn't be anywhere close to the turnout this movie received and the rating would be something like a 6.Overall, it wasn't a terrible movie, but it certainly wasn't good either and I wouldn't recommend it."
"A Masterpiece
I may consider myself lucky to be alive to watch Christopher Nolan Works which get better by years.Oppenheimer is - with no doubt- going to be one of the best movies in the history. Amazing cinematography, Exceptional acting and terrifying Soundtracks.All the cast are great from cilian Murphy who is going for the oscar with this role to Rupert Downey jr and Emily blunt and finally rami malik who has small scenes but you will never forget them.I didn't watch it in Imax as i couldn't wait and ran to the nearest cinema but now i will sure book an imax ticket.Don't waste any time, book your ticket and Go watch it.. NOW."
"Oppenheimer (2023) is an extraordinary film that captivated my senses from start to finish. This historical drama, directed by the brilliant Christopher Nolan, weaves a mesmerizing narrative that delves deep into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist whose work changed the course of history during World War II.From the moment the film begins, the audience is transported back in time to the tumultuous era of the 1940s, and Nolan's impeccable attention to detail immerses us into the historical setting effortlessly. The cinematography is awe-inspiring, and the breathtaking landscapes blend seamlessly with the authentic period settings, bringing Oppenheimer's world to life.The casting is nothing short of perfection. Cillian Murphy delivers an Oscar-worthy performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer, capturing the complexity and inner struggles of the enigmatic physicist with unparalleled depth. His portrayal is nuanced and compelling, allowing us to empathize with Oppenheimer's moral dilemmas and the burden he carries as the father of the atomic bomb.The supporting cast, including talented actors like Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, and Tom Hardy, further enriches the movie, elevating it to cinematic greatness. Each character is beautifully crafted and contributes significantly to the story's emotional weight.One of the most impressive aspects of Oppenheimer is its intelligent and thought-provoking script. Kudos to the screenwriters for expertly exploring the ethical questions surrounding scientific discoveries during wartime, the moral responsibilities of scientists, and the consequences of unleashing such powerful weaponry on the world.The film's score, composed by the incomparable Hans Zimmer, is nothing short of a symphonic masterpiece. It amplifies the emotional impact of every scene, pulling at our heartstrings and enhancing the overall experience.Christopher Nolan's direction is, without a doubt, a work of art. His ability to interweave historical events with human emotions and philosophical musings is nothing short of genius. He masterfully guides the audience through a rollercoaster of emotions, leaving us contemplating the consequences of our actions long after the credits roll.Oppenheimer is not merely a historical retelling; it's a powerful reflection on the frailty of humanity, the pursuit of knowledge, and the consequences of playing with forces beyond our comprehension. This film will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression on anyone fortunate enough to witness it on the big screen.In conclusion, Oppenheimer is an unparalleled cinematic experience that deserves every single one of its five stars. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction, outstanding performances, breathtaking cinematography, and emotional depth make this film a true masterpiece. It is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates the power of storytelling and the impact of historical events on the course of human history."
"The movies indeed has excellent story telling and it is very long complex story, covering it in 3 hours should be challenging task, but but are talking about Christopher Nolan, so it will be casual for him. I'm saying it, is and should be excellent a movie. I confess I did not understand all the movie, I think will take 4 or 5 times of watching.(I don't have five hundred characters for fill my movie review to post this review, so I'm posting my predicaments of filling five hundred characters in the review so it become five hundred characters. Oh god it need more characters, twenty more to go. Done)"
"Today I watched this movie in IMAX and boy, every penny spent for the movie ticket was worth it.The soundtrack was god-tier, the acting was phenomenal, especially Murphy, Blunt and Robert Downey Jr and the storytelling and screenplay was out of this world.I honestly didn't check my phone even once, it was engaging all along, the pacing was perfect, it kept you hooked to the screen. So I can't relate with the reviews that label this movie as boring.This movie compels you to think, leaves you speechless. The moral dilemma faced by Oppenheimer is so beautifully displayed that you find yourself struggling with your own thoughts.Watching it in cinemas is a must, and trust me this will be a good use of your money."
"This movie is insane! It has everything and Nolan is able to pace it so well, all the tension during dialogue, movie of the century. Not to mention all the great actors and actresses, wow Cillian Murphy was phenomenal, his eyes could talk, Emily Blunt nailed it with the so called non trial scene, Matt Damon was very subtle but his acting was so deep and solid, last but not least, RDJ was so great, we all know he's great but he was under the ironman shadow, he shook it off so damn well.To summarize, Oppenheimer is not just a movie, it's literally ART, I would say it's my favorite Nolan movie, it's slow when it needed to, it's fast when it needed to. The atmosphere and the pace is PERFECT. Definitely a must-see movie, I stopped drinking and eating three hours before watching Oppenheimer, and it's worth every bit of my efforts, it lives up to the hype."
"Holy moly . Where do I start . I was dreading going to watch a movie three hours long but Wow , just wow . This movie does not feel long as you get sucked in to the story and the excellent performances by Cillian Murphy , Robert downy JR and the rest of the excellent A list cast .The movie is truly a masterpiece in cinema , as directing , editing , acting , soundstage are all wonderful. It's like reliving an era in the past and the cast has done an immense job of immersing themselves into the characters they played .Do not make the mistake of going in to watch a movie about the bomb. It's more about the father of the bomb and how he was treated afterwards and certainly will not disappoint you."
"This movie is one of Nolans best works so far. You see that his experience in previous movies comes together in this 180 minute journey. It's a mix of different ingredients, such as a history lesson, drama and thriller.Especially with the IMAX experience you are inside the movie from the first second. Beside the brilliant performances of multiple World famous actors, is the leading man himself (Cillian Murphy) born to embody this role. With the cinematography and sounds on point combined with the best script that is suited to tell this story that changed the World forever, Christopher Nolan did it again.The moment you walk out of that theatre knowing you just watched something very special, but still have some unanswered questions, is the best gift a filmmaker can give to an audience that they can take home.I write this review 24 hours after watching the movie because I was still processing with what I just watched. I just can't think about anything that was slightly off with this movie, and realized everything was on point and came together to one masterpiece. That's why I rate it 10 stars. Absolutely worth every minute."
"Every things is perfect a great piece from Christopher Nolan there is no mistake in it and absolutely there is no movie greater than this
it does not disappointed me at all what can i say
i hope will be more movies like this in the future
Christopher Nolan respect the art in his work and this movie an Example how cinema industry should be the acting is Historical i think the crew will sweep the Oscar awards and of course the music was the bomb in this year
this film will be in my mind so long to forget it is my favorite film thank for reading my article about this great work and this is everything."
"You really need your wits about you to follow this film. There are frequent and often quite rapid cuts to different time periods, perhaps a little overdone at times. Nolan helps by filming all of the Lewis Strauss (played beautifully by Robert Downey Jnr) scenes in black and white.The pace is relentless yet I still felt the film was just a little bit too long - the first hour in particular was at times even a little boring. Once we get to the Trinity test, the film absolutely soars - although everyone knows what happened, the film becomes breath-taking and powerful. The subsequent scenes involving the witch-hunt against Oppenheimer and the senate hearings to confirm Strauss's cabinet position are impressive.The acting is uniformly good, especially RDJ. I thought Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer was good but just a little too quixotic - you're never quite sure exactly what he believes, especially in the first half. It was great to see Tom Conti again, although maybe a little miscast as Einstein. Florence Pugh was given a few rather gratuitously explicit sex scenes, which I thought were just a little too bizarre. And as usual there were very good performances from Emily Blunt and Matt Damon.Another major gripe is the soundtrack - appropriate in style but way too loud, detracting from the visual experience at times.All in all a powerful but imperfect movie, certainly worth seeing, but it will require your intense concentration to keep up with the chaos at times. Not quite a masterpiece in my book."
"The first two hours were disjointed and annoying at times ... rapid and awkward scene changes, unrelated cuts to different story threads that had no sense of connection or relevance at times. There were story elements in the first half that could have easily been left out, there was no need to make this movie 3 hours long. It should have been about quality, not quantity. However with all that said, the last hour of this movie rescued what could have been a disaster. It was brilliant, dramatic and intense, Nolan at his best in my opinion. It left me feeling that it had been a worthwhile movie-going experience despite the lack of coherence in the first two hours."
"I loved the effects in the movie and the sound was fantastic. The sound experience was indescribable. It may not suit everyone's taste, but I'm sure whoever loves this type of movie will like it. The cast was amazing, elite actors. Cillian Murphy's performance was amazing, he mastered the role of Benheimer more than him 😂 and he also gave the character his own flavor because of his unique facial features. In short, the movie is worth watching the money and time It is also not suitable for children under 13 from my point of view, but I wish they showed the effects of the nuclear bomb on the human being from the center of the bomb until the last trace of it."
"Oppenheimer was the manifestation of the type of story Nolan had been itching to tell all his career. It represents him in a microcosm - a deep, emotionally layered story, harrowingly combining scientific, social, and political intricacies of the 1940s.The last hour of the film, full of defining exchanges in Oppenheimer and Lewis Strauss's security hearings, might look confusing to some fans. But this is where the beauty of Oppenheimer lies. It perfectly captures the chaotic, emotionally draining, and painfully glorious life of the father of the atomic bomb.The epic scores added a new dimension to the film. Thanks to the genius composition of Ludwig Goransson, fans lived the movie through their screens. Much like Nolan promised, fans felt the explosion of the Trinity Test. The VFX and sound work done to include Oppenheimer's words ""now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds"" only added to its poetic nature.Oppenheimer might be no Inception or Interstellar, but the richness of the story, and the purity of his directing have ensured it's not only Nolan's richest masterpiece to date, but one of the finest movies of the 21st century as well."

"Oppenheimer is a dialogue heavy film that covers the development of the atomic bomb and the devastating impact and threat it posed to the world at the time and even nowadays.In Oppenheimer, Nolan has shifted genres from his usual Sci-Fi to a Biopic/Drama. Instead of his usual mind bending topics, Oppenheimer is more focused on characters and their relationships with each other, which could be considered a more 'straightforward' film.The film is 3 hours long and involves many jumps in time. The beginning of the film is fairly slow paced, however speeds up by the middle and end.The technical aspects were great, with beautiful visuals accompanied by a very captivating musical score. However in some specific scenes, the background music becomes a distraction and muffles the speech.The entire cast were amazing with one of Cillian Murphy and RDJ's best performances.Overall, having seen the movie twice, I would recommend Oppenheimer. Some people may consider it 'boring' which is understandable due to the vast amount of information packed in. For Nolan lovers such as myself, Oppenheimer varies greatly from his other films but still worth a watch."
"The most important film ever made. After each viewing - by now I have the third behind me - this opinion solidifies. The exceptional director Christopher Nolan once again succeeds in projecting onto the big screen, with incredible attention to detail, unprecedented narrative structure and groundbreaking audiovisual design, the themes that have accompanied mankind since time immemorial and that make us ourselves a projection screen: Betrayal, death, time, love, the thirst for knowledge and progress. If Christopher Nolan has always based his previous works on these themes latently and sometimes individually, in Oppenheimer he unfolds them in a bundled and cumulative manner, questioning them anew throughout the film and thereby constructing them anew. Oppenheimer is a film that revitalizes, even reanimates, the institution of cinema, which was believed to be dead. The scenes in which the atomic bomb is tested and its dropping on Hiroshima is ""glorified"" in a speech by Oppenheimer are among the best that cinematic art has ever produced. The final section leaves one stunned, thoughtful, and at times disturbed. And that is exactly the task and the unique selling point of a movie theater. A mixture of biopic, horror film, courtroom drama and thriller - tightly packed and intricately knotted as only a Christopher Nolan is capable of. Oppenheimer is a film that society needed. After countless superhero and other CGI-drenched films in recent years, Nolan's 'Opus Magnum' is both an aesthetic delight and an existential challenge for our gray brain cells. That's exactly where the important questions burn themselves in after the viewing: Why is man trying to extinguish himself? What is progress worth at the expense of human lives? And how the hell did the British director manage to translate such a brute production into picture and sound?"
"Stop comparing Oppenheimer to anything at all what's important is everyone knowing the truth about J robert Oppenheimer, people are supporting a fictional character movie instead of a biography of the greatest person ever existed, his sufferings, the misbehave, the boycott, the pain, Oppenheimer changed the world, Oppenheimer ended world war, Oppenheimer invented the great thing ever to exist, but people think something else is more important than that, but people laughed in the hall where Oppenheimer was playing, the sad thing is that people don't even understand the movie this movie is a feeling."
"If this movie does not win an Oscar for the best picture of the year... One of the best movies of all time, PERIOD! There is not a better way to portrait a story of the father of the atomic bomb and Christopher Nolan is the only guy right now, who could have done it. So many A-list actors. Through out the movie, you see more and more familiar faces, such as Casey Affleck and Gary Oldman. It never felt too long. We are so lucky to live in this era of Hollywood and to witness such movies. And what makes this movie even better, that there is ZERO CGI. Everything you see (or will see) is practical.God bless Cillian Murphy, RDJ, Chris Nolan."
"The story of J Robert Oppenheimer 'the father of the Atomic bomb' in the hands of Christopher Nolan is a somewhat over inflated dialogue heavy affair. The film flashes back and forwards in time, and is often engrossing, particularly during build up to the first A-Bomb test, but it also gets bogged down in talky scenes focused on political and scientific controversies both during and after WW2. I thought that perhaps a more economical approach could have made Oppenheimer truly gripping and great, and could have helped explore more effectively the post WW2 period when Oppenheimer fell foul of McCarthy era investigations. I also found the music score often unnecessarily intrusive and annoying, further highlighting a sense of the film being just a bit over done, however, there were still things to savour, not the least an uncannily vivid and convincing performance by Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, plus many other excellent performances, effectively making the acting the best thing about the film. I thought Oppenheimer was a largely coherent and informative though rambling portrait of the man, wonderfully performed, meticulously written and directed by Nolan, but just pretty good when just a bit more economy might have made it great."
"Many people have mentioned some shortcomings such as no mention of the Trinity downwind sufferers who got cancer from this, no showing of The local workers involved they don't even appear on the screen, it's all white faces, and of course no perspective of the Japanese who were slaughtered innocent people who were slaughtered, Oppenheimer was no hero!, for what it's worth I'm sure it has been demonstrated clearly that the bombs didn't have to be dropped despite all those who say it ended the war the war had already really ended, look it up!, don't just read the history of the victors, also the story jumps around way too much, it's like who's who of atomic energy and quantum physics but so what, a snoozefest to be sure, why all the hoodoo?"
"I didn't even know who Julius Robert Oppenheimer was until the announcement of the movie was made (forgive me that I only focused on histories in my country), so I did a lil bit of research before watching the movie and learned all about the Manhattan Project, Navajo miners, the Trinity Test, the Oppenheimer security hearing, the Chevalier incident, and McCarthyism.I'm not a fan of biography or war films, so I was actually scared going in, thinking that I'd be bored to death, but nope, it's actually not boring at all. This is my first time watching a Christopher Nolan movie in a cinema, so I was so excited to experience it on the big screen, and as expected, I left the theatre satisfied.What I like most about the movie is the score, which is so chilling, powerful, and epic. It's not Han Zimmer, but still, Ludwig Göransson has a strong discography. I also like how some shots in the movie are interchanging with particles and explosions, as it gives a more intense feeling. I love that one scene everyone is talking about and how eerie it is with the screaming noises and bombing parallel.I was hoping to see more on the effect of radiation on the uranium miners and how they were being treated, but it's not included in the movie, which is understandable considering the lengthy runtime. I'm slightly disappointed that the movie didn't explore more of the ""spy"" character. The reveal is underwhelming because I didn't even realize who he was until he was mentioned towards the end.All of the cast did an amazing job, but (don't attack me) Matt Damon's delivery of the lieutenant general's lines sounds goofy in that one scene from the trailer. I got emotional watching Emily Blunt's performance as Oppenheimer's wife, Kitty. Cillian Murphy's role as the ""father of the atomic bomb"" is outstanding. He might finally win an Oscar. You can clearly see his conscience and wonder whether Oppenheimer was a brilliant physicist who fell victim to McCarthyism or if he was only a hypocrite trying to cover his inner communism. ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.""I will never rate a movie a 10/10, so I gave it an 8 because there are parts that confused me, especially with the names of the characters considering its massive lineup, the time jumps, and the whole communism thingy, despite the movie differentiating the scenes with a B&W filter.It's ironic that I decided to watch Oppenheimer entirely because of the Barbenheimer trend since I originally planned to only watch Barbie, but somehow I like Oppenheimer more 🤣 P/s: I was looking forward to seeing Devon Bostick the most because RODRICK RULES 🤣🤘"
"This movie has reached its expectations and was even better. The story telling of this movie was absolute Masterpiece and told us everything about oppenheimers life, told us what was happening in his head. The cinematography of this movie was also amazing but what else can you expect from Christopher Nolan. The pacing of this movie was almost perfect and I have enjoyed every second of this movie. I have felt every emotion that oppie has felt and I had the feeling that I have lived those moments. I loved the process and the switches between black and white and colourful cinema. The scene when the bomb went off had my heart pounding and the end had me thinking for many days. Plus the music was excellent. One of the best endings of a movie if not the best. AMAZING 10/10 must watch in IMAX for the full experience."
"Apart from exceptional acting, what grips you is the handling of the storyline. The way things move in about three timelines doesn't let you feel the joy of the Trinity test. The celebrations by the team of scientists, though we found reasonable at the time, it also connects us with the absurdity of the nuclear arms race. The revelation about Strauss comes at right time. There are so many thoughts one comes out with introspecting about. Loved the storytelling, art of movie making. The background music and the sound effects are excellent in raising the anxiety and other emotions. Cinematography is excellent and creates the period before us."
"I love Nolan's films for their ability to pierce my mind with emotions, to bring tears. I didn't expect it to be the same with this biographical drama, but I was wrong. Repeatedly catching the state of numbness of the body, a lump in the throat and the inability to move, the tears themselves came out involuntarily. A whirlwind of wonderful visuals and an unsurpassed musical part just slams you into the cinema seat and keeps you in suspense for a long time.The actors are at their best, Murphy is probably at the peak of his career in this motion picture. We will certainly see him holding the Best Actor soon.Definitely recommend and look forward to watching again."
"Absolutely stunned by this film, it's a cinema lovers MUST. I was drawn within the opening scene and left speechless by the last, Cillian gives one of the best leading performances I've ever seen and the cast backing him are incredible. A Nolan masterpiece my favourite of his so far! If you are second guessing because of the run time just go with the flow and indulge in this experience and I doubt you will regret it.I loved how Nolan came up with the idea of having this film in the first person giving the lead a proper spotlight and shine on what a incredibly intelligent and also trouble man that Oppenheimer was and also I loved how the 2nd person shots were black and white which really helped divide the story, it gave it a different dynamic and point of view for thr audience."
"If you look somewhere else for a brief second you will miss a key detail or a line and it really ruins your day , for a three hour movie it really is hard to focus and understand but if you manage to stand still it really makes you think about perspectives and peoples point of view ,other than that it really is a masterpiece. You really feel the view of Oppenheimer and it makes you think about how unsecure people believe the whole world shapes around them. At the end though i dont have any think to say really, for a Nolan movie you probably can not leave the movie theater more satisfied and relieved."
"""Oppenheimer"" is an extraordinary cinematic achievement that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist and leader of the Manhattan Project. The film skillfully weaves together historical accuracy with captivating storytelling, offering viewers a deep insight into the complexities of his character and the moral dilemmas faced during the creation of the atomic bomb. With outstanding performances and breathtaking cinematography, ""Oppenheimer"" keeps audiences engaged from start to finish. A must-watch for history enthusiasts and anyone seeking a thought-provoking cinematic experience."
The way that Nolan show the things sometimes objective sometime subjective made the film to understand the way it goes to. I thought only before bomb scenes were there and I really thought that film is finished when the bomb drop down to Hiroshima. In the interrogation scenes the way turnover is like WOW. And while you watch the film you are into it you feel every emotion. Of course I don't need to say actors were really perfect. Casting was really fitted their character. I liked the Nolan showed politics not straight. (eg: He didn't mention Nazis at all) I mean that we are just watching oppenheimer not World War 2.
"This movie has three distinct thirds, two of which I believe are extremely bloated and poorly executed. Don't get me wrong this movie is incredibly well made, well acted, and beautiful to look at, but it's also flawed.Backstory and slow moving plots are perfectly fine, but it still needs to be engaging. The first third of the movie moves at a snails pace, and it not engaging in the slightest. I love slow moving dramas, but the characters need to be interconnected and the plot needs to move, here it does not.The second third is pretty great, having a slow build up to a powerful climax. Not much to say here, it's a good hour.The final third of the movie is stronger than the first but still lacks engagement. Straus's? Moves against Robert come across un-impactful and thus the entire third act just isn't overly fun to watch.Many have said it, but 3 hours is simply not needed for this film. I would take 30 minutes off of the first third, 40 off of the last, and add 20 to the middle to add more time in the best part of the film.Overall, it's a well made movie, most likely a good movie; But it's also not an engaging or entertaining movie."
"I personally did not like the non-linear structure of the film. The way that Nolan tried to spin Strauss's betrayal as suspense was lackluster and off-putting . Firstly, the structure really just made the trial lack build-up. Practically, the last ten minutes or so is where things unfold haphazardly. Almost trying to piece together a cop-out climactic surprise villain ending. Then 'thematic' suspense is just off-putting for what it was trying to do, create a complex view of Oppenheimer. By the end, he was just doing Spielberg's school of Heroes vs Villain. Strauss, very bad man. Oppenheimer, complex but mostly good. Its too simplified for comfort. The use of time could have been more effective in showing the change that the film aims to show with Oppenheimer's view of the bomb to be honest.It had more success in telling the pre-trial Oppenheimer. I think its much more successful in creating the enigma of Oppenheimer. You could see him weak, uncompromising, a bit psychotic, and just a tad bit hypocritical. I felt that some portion can be edited down clearly, especially the Communist period or the pre-Alamo days, which was while important in the trial, does not really hold any weight once told verbally. It is what it is, people he had knew. The relationship between his wife and him could have been the better choice to focus on. The three hours is not entirely necessary for the film to be honest.Otherwise, the film is marvelous and well-crafted. I think Cillian, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Safdie were noteworthy in the film. The story could definitely had be tweaked. 3/5."
"Oppenheimer is one of those films that manages to continue catching you despite reaching its ecstatic point (When the trinity test ends) and that manages to link a story from which there are so many points of view. The characters are excellently portrayed, a special mention to Cillian Murohy and Robert Downey Jr, they must be at the Oscars. The music is not far behind, it accompanies the scenes very well and manages to create that drama. One of my favorite scenes is when Oppenheimer gives his speech in front of the participants of the Manhattan experiment in Los Alamos after breaking the news of the ""success"" of the Atomic Bomb, it is here where we see the change of thought and behavior of a man who, trying to save the world, started a war worse than he expected. A movie is good and unique when it lasts 3 hours and during the 3 hours you are attentive to what happens in the plot, Oppenheimer manages to do that and keep viewers on edge throughout the movie."
"This movie is probably one of the best movies I have seen in recent times and is going up there with movies im going to rewatch the rest of my life.First of all the life of an amazingly complicated man is super hard to portray in 1 or even 2 hours. If you look at the 3 hours as long before watching this movie, dont worry. I thought the same thing, I figured it would be a slow paced movie like an in-depth character study. But this movie caught me off guard. Christopher Nolan has paced this movie expertly, it is suprisingly fast paced at times, but it still takes it time to explore Oppenheimer's mind.Cillian Murphy was born to play this role, he expresses so much with just one look alone. All the actors in this just feel perfect and they all shine when on screen. There is not a singel person who feels ""out of place"": Nolan even took some chances with some lesser known actors like Norwigain actor Trond Fausa who plays a Ukrainian explosians expert. This is truly an Oscar-worthy preformance by the whole cast and from Nolan.What really sealed the deal on this movie was the soundtrack by Ludwig Göransson. He shined when making music for Disney for shows like The Book of Boba Fett and The Mandalorian. The score for openheimer is truly his lifes work. The score ""Can you hear the music"" gave me goosebumps every time it plays.This is a breathtaking movie, but I would recommend doing some degree of research before watching. There is a lot of talking and if you go inn blank on who Oppenheimer is you might get lost at some point.Lastly I want to mention the one thing keeping this from a 10/10. The mixing of the music and dialouge is awkward at times. I watched this with my father and he asked me multiple times throughout the movie what was said. It can be hard to hear what they say at times. But this is merely a technical issue and the cinematography and music and acting makes up for it easily."
"This is just a cinematic masterpiece, but, the minutes leading to the bomb test moment and reaching that climax... the entire room just suddenly became absolutely silent. You couldn't even hear people breathing, it would literally be possible to hear a fly... what a moment that was. From that moment on until the end of the movie every body was apprehensive. I think is the best way to put it.The visuals, the sound, the storytelling, the performances, what an actual masterpiece. In my opinion this is the 2 best C. Noland movie (only toped by interstellar).If you can please watch it in IMax, it is worth it."
"Nolan is back again in the game. Always using great shots, good actors, nagnificent performances and scenarios, making it ideal. The trama is good, it keeps you in the edge of your seat, nail bitting conversations, and helping with the memory on flashbacks to the characters with a lot of lastnames and not too many background for each (except Einstein), to improve the experience of the mlvie. Even with 3 hours long, it never felt like more than a 2 hour film, because it was so intense and you are so deep in the trama, that you dont see the time flow. Romantic scenes are short and precise, so it is a great overal movie to watch. Band reminds you to interstellar and Batman, so it is a great gesture. Psycho is intense with mind blowing scenes that leave you thinking on what could happen.Nolan, you are GREAT once more."
"Masterpiece from a master.Title: ""A Journey Through Time: Unraveling the Past""Rating: (5/5)I recently had the pleasure of watching the documentary film ""A Journey Through Time: Unraveling the Past,"" and I must say, it was an awe-inspiring and thought-provoking cinematic experience.

"The story is adapted from ""The American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and M. J. Sherwin, a Pulitzer price winner book. Nolan being an exemplary director, depicts why J. Robert Oppenheimer should be or shouldn't why he wasn't America's Prometheus (a Greek Titan who stole fire from gods and gave them to mortals and was chained to eternity for this act). The movie covers every aspect of his life, his highs and his lows, his selflessness and his pride and strives to achieve an accurate depiction of an character as complex as ""The father of Atom Bomb"". But it's not just Nolan that shines in this film, almost everyone on the screen is at their best. Cillian's portrayal of Oppenheimer must be his best job till date and that isn't an simple statement considering the actor of his caliber, so do Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Robert Downey Jr. In their roles. Camerawork and Sound is another thing, Christopher Nolan has mastered, and like his most other movies, Oppenheimer is no different when it comes to
Cinematography and Sound design. I haven't seen it in 2D yet, but the movie seems to be explicitly tailor made for IMAX, so it comes as no surprise that movies seems even better in it.The film however sometimes becomes a bit too fast paced, with some scenes spontaneously cutting black and transiting between Oppenheimer's past and present, lose focus for a moment and you might be confused for a moment. It does not hinder the storyline though, sometimes it works in story's favour sometimes it doesn't.I don't get why leading critics are accusing the movie to be an ""History TV Movie"" when it's much more than that."
"""Raindrops like minute explosions. Human, enslaved with an godly unbearable burden""Oppenheimer is a manifestation of both immense and incomprehensible switch in a military dynamic of the previous epoch, giving birth to a new one, one we live in. Intense, suppressed, vague one. Masterfully played out by Nolan a quintessence of fear and ash-like bloodshed prospects, all in one man pushing the button.Introducing characters was an intense marathon, indeed, and yet it was motivated by a necessity of keeping the atomic tempo, the one that J. R. Oppenheimer was in. Every character has put a piece of him-/herself into Robert creating a complicated, almost fathomless conflict inside a man that can be barely grasped. And every character was sophisticatedly comprehended and analyzed by Nolan, making them appear so real on-screen. Not to mention how superb the Oppenheimer-Strauss dynamic was played out.In the end a viewer can see Robert in an abyssal regret, a question carved deep into his mind that is so hard to be answered, neither by him nor by the rest of humanity. At this moment the viewer is imbued with inner desolation.In technical aspect there is no arguing in an absolute proficient Nolan's approach to befitting depiction of a story; the music rushing through your ears down to your heart, skipping even the brain sometimes, to be properly perceived. And the whole importance for filmmaking not to forget what it was born for.Without any doubts this artwork will become a crucial memo, venerated by future generations of filmmakers and filmgoers. And rightly so."

"Like many people I admire Nolan as a filmmaker, I think he's the closes thing we have to a Kubrick in the modern day, not so much for his style or sensibilities but merely for the fact that each film he makes has ambition, often tackles different genres, they're high-budget films but also intelligent and artistically accomplished. Also his name is well known enough that each new film he makes is an event. Personally my favorites of his are Memento, Interstellar, The Prestige, Insomnia, I also admire Inception though it has some flaws imo. Don't care much for his Batman films, to me they are not entertaining enough and don't really capture the spirit of Batman from the comics (Tim Burton did a better job with that).However I often find his storytelling style a bit muddled and convoluted. I often find myself confused as to why characters are doing things, there is a lack of clarity for me in his films, and the frequent time jumps don't help either. I didn't care for his last two films, Dunkirk and Tenet, at all. Oppenheimer is a step up from those but not by a lot.The basic problem for me is a lack of tension and suspense in the film. Maybe it's because I know nothing bad happens to Oppenheimer, ok he gets removed from the program but it's not like he goes to jail or something. The supporting characters are all pretty interchangeable, the movie just didn't really grab me. We never get an idea of why Oppenheimer out of all people ended up being the person in charge of this Manhattan program.The details of how they got to the conclusion that he did have communist sympathies just wasn't compelling enough to me. Basically, nothing really bad happens to anyone in the film. You just learn a bit more details about how things went down surrounding this historic event but it's not gripping stuff at all.I give it a 7 out of respect for Nolan, Murphy's performance, the Trinity test sequence, and for me Tom Conti's portrayal of Einstein pretty much steals the movie, should have had much more screentime."
Oppenheimer is a story of a flawed protagonist that undergos no redemption arch. He is portrayed as 'above' regular human morality and at no stage shows any remorse for his many horrid acts that span decades of his life.There are no character throughout the film in which you root for nor empathise with. And some of the direction in this regard is questionable.Being a biopic it is to be commended that very little has been altered however this doesn't make the movie any more engaging and the few changes that have been made are bizarre choices in my opinion.Epicly acted and beautifully shot. RDJ is a particular stand out and Damon is as good as ever. As with every Nolan film there is enough art and audio to keep true cinefiles engaged.But this is the first cinema experience I've had in over a decade where multiple parties walked out. And I also witnessed people sleeping in the last hour.Somehow even the A-Bomb test is underwhelming. Although the tension in the build up is masterful.But Oppenheimers biggest crime is feeling so arrogant in its own awesomeness that to dislike it feels as though it's a problem with and that you're wrong. It is pompous. And extremely boring.I felt every minute of its 3 hour run time.Oppenheimer would serve as a great mini series or a factual documentary with dramatisation throughout.But as a standalone film I was far from blown away.I would give it 1 star except for that being disrespectful to the amazing acting and technological feats throughout.
"As expected nothing less from the legendary director, the movie doesn't fail to meet up your expectations in fact it exceeds your expectations through the roof.It may seem that with respect to the plot or the general storyline it would be enjoyable to people who are more into .. science but I assure this movie has the essence that just drags anyone's attention to it, to an extent that you wont even know when the 3 hours passed.One other good point about the movie is that it didn't just portray just the science genre into it, it contained other subject matter into like politics, history, moral and ethical perspectives which made the movie much more interesting as it managed to effectively utilize these themes.Now besides plot and everything else, the core and essential factor of the movie which actually gives you the sensation of hype is the pure art of cinematography, acting and sound design. The way the scenes transition from past to present throughout the movie makes it unique and interesting to the viewers and ensures to capture the viewer's attention. The color scheme used too is quite interesting as it uses B/W for the events happening whereas colored events to describe Oppenheimer's story. Coming to the main point the sound design, its immaculate. The essence of sound and where, when and how it was used completely gave you goosebumps and the sensation of hype. Sound really played a vital role in ensuring your movie experience as a rollercoaster ride. The acting was perfectly executed as well, as throughout the movie it really makes you feel that rather than just acting it was from the heart, it had a very natural flow and felt very real.It might seem that the movie would just end after all the scientific ""story"" is done but the politics and drama used after made it just more interesting. You may not understand the complete political and drama part at one go but that's just the essence of the movie which makes you wanna watch it again and understand it better. This point automatically just says how good the movie is. It just wants to make you come back to it again.It would be a crime if i didn't mention CGI wasn't used. Hearing that at first it piqued my interest. When I watched the movie and saw how those explosions were made it really blew my mind. The details and the exaggeration on the explosion made it better than CGI. This is another fact why people are interested or hyped about the movie and it didn't fail to surprise them.In conclusion, this movie truly is a piece of art and the best 3 hours you would ever spend. The plot is immersive and the mastery of cinematography, sound design and application makes the movie a literal black hole that sucks all your attention, and the best thing is you couldn't get tired of it. So, overall the movie is a perfect experience and is guranteed to make you come back for more."
"I get the movie and length may not be to everyone's taste, but good lord did this film have me hooked for the entire runtime. During the trinity test sequence, I was biting my fingernails and could feel my heartbeat in my chest. I can't remember the last time I was at the cinema and a movie had me feeling like that. Murphy, Downey Jr and Blunt were outstanding in their roles, and everyone else was great too. The score and sound design were incredible too. The scene in the gymnasium was genuinely terrifying and will stick with me, I thought it was handled perfectly. I would highly recommend watching this at the cinema if you could!"
"""Now I have Become Death, the Destroyer of the Worlds""The calm view of a tiny drop of rain water hitting a puddle and producing large waves of various wavelengths and the frightening view of a tiny atomic bomb, falling towards mother earth and wreaking havoc, producing astounding shock waves! Both are the inevitable forces of nature and attract the attention of a scientific mind. And amidst the extra-ordinary analogy of these two spectacular powers of nature, master filmmaker Christopher Nolan tries to explore the differences. The falling rain drop hits the puddle hard but doesn't cause any harm to any living beings; it's fundamental. Whereas, the nuclear forces extracted out of a splitting atom on purpose is a force of nature summoned by the Man. And who will take the responsibility and it's inevitable consequences?""Oppenheimer"" is a horror story told in the truest and most delicate form of humanism. It can also be viewed as the character study of a complex Physicist and his inner conflicts juxtaposed by how the top persons in power look at them with wrong perspective. Was very fortunate to see first day first show of this masterpiece.There are four detonation sequences in the film literally and allegorically. First one was the celebrated Trinity Test of July 16, 1945 in Los Alamos. In order to know, what are the rest of the three, you have to experience this film. As as per as visual depiction is concerned, these are NOT the portrayal of bombing events of Hiroshima and Nagasaki which were ofcourse, the inevitable inhuman consequence of the ""detonation"". It's deeply philosophical, emotional and concerning; the sensibility what Nolan has mastered over the years. It will chill down your spine.For cine-lovers, the cross cutting of the scenes and their juxtapositions with picture perfect background score by Ludwig Göransson takes the emotion, tension and further characterisation to a new height. The bombing scene, the use of flash and fire, the words (of consciousness, ""I am the death, the destroyer of the world"" in the real Oppenheimer's voice) and the sound and shock are something what you have never experienced before. The performances are amazing and no words are sufficient to describe Cilian Murphy (his eyes), Robert Downey Jr and Emily Blunt. Performance of the later one is highly underrated (as I am seeing the reviews) but she did a tremendous job as a person witnessing the nasty politics as an independent individual. The lesser screen time doesn't make the performance no way thinner or lesser.Rest, there are many great films on Science Fiction but this one can be depicted as a great work on ""Scientific Consciousness"" , the consciousness what in spite of all the accomplishment tell us to introspect our choice and fate. It will be celebrated in years to come."
"From the moment I say the first trailer, I knew I had to see this movie in the cinema's. Luckily, I was able to see the movie in a IMAX cinema yesterday and boy oh boy. This film ticks all the boxes. With ease it joins the ranks into my top 20 movies of all time. And that for a movie enthusiast that has seen a lot of excellent movies (top 100 idmb e.g.).ON: Everything is in place: actors, music, pacing, visuals. There is absolutely nothing what is not correct. Besides the great visuals and music, the 3 hours fly by, because Nolan knows how to keep the audience attention without effort for the viewer. The moment where you come for, the explosion, breathtaking..Also and in my opinion, Nolan is so strong in setting up a normal dialogue between people. It just feels as if you are -in- the conversation, the emotion in the face right at the moment when you would search for it if you were in that conversation. All those subtle, but essential details in directing that makes a 3 hour sit not feel like a long sit. The only thing you notice at the end is a soar back ha-ha.Besides the great directing and visuals, the (oscar-worthy) acting performance of Robert Downey Jr. And Cilian are also out of this world. Ever since ""The Judge"" and ""The Peeky Blinders"", I knew that these two would carry the film to new heights.Altogether, you HAVE to see this movie in cinema, because I think it is an insult to see it at home. A 10 out of 10 from me."
"It is a wonderful movie and I enjoyed watching it. The movie contains the wonderful drama that we miss in our time, and it also contains many beautiful dialogues that make you live every second in the movie and also the characters in the movie who played their role in an impressive way such as Cillian Murphy who quoted the character and also Robert Downey Jr. And all the actors with sound effects and the good thing is that you did not use visual effects and that makes you live the reality and live that era in time (Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds) It's really cool, great work, Nolan."
"The acting and directing are amazing. The lines hidden within every series of act will stuck with you. Very precise storytelling, it make you feel what exactly how you have to feel with every minute of it. The plots are complex but not confusing. All the conversations put together can be a little overwhelming, but overall, it draws back to the point every once in a while. Cillian Murphy is killing it, an awesome acted piece, same, makes you feel exactly how you need to feel with Oppenheimer. You can easily cry hard just watching the takes of his big close ups. The whole cast wonderfully acted as well. The soundtrack, the editing, it's a film with all fine arts putting together."
"It is filmmaking at its best. This is CLASS A. It is in my Nolan top 4 for sure. Not ahead of Inception or Tenet, but somewhere near Dunkirk.The atmosphere of it intoxicates you. It gets under your skin and never leaves. This is how biopics about such historical figures should be made. This is Nolan's ""12 Angry Men"" meets ""Memento"". Brutally 9.5/10 for me.The decision of making it from the POV of Oppenheimer is extraterrestrial intelligence. The treatment of how to show the world the way he saw it is an amazing choice.Cinematography is revolutionary. Nolan, Hoyte, and Imax films are the Trinity of modern filmmaking. It makes me feel like if I was living in 1968 and watching Kubrick's 2001 for the first time. Rebellious filmmaking. Extreme to the core.The haunting experimental score of Ludwig Görannson is traumatizing. It captures the weird combination of history, science, science fiction, philosophy, horror, nervousness, self doubt, triumph, and tragedy.The acting in general is phenomenal. Cillian Murphy lost himself in the magic of the role, and Robert Downey Jr is Oscar contender. These performances will be remembered for a long long time. The small parts are also amazing. Bennie Safdie, Casey Affleck, and Matthias Schweigoffer are mesmerizing.The custom design, production design, and the whole decorations are capturing the spirit of the terrifying, yet astonishing 1940s.What really captured me is the work on clothes and make ups. The characterizations are so accurate and yet creative.The pace, scenery, dynamics, and themes are all showcases of Nolan's abilities as a world designer.So terrifying and satisfying. One of the most important films in the history of filmmaking."
Best acting performance ive ever seen in my entire life robert downy junior deserves an oscar.Cillian murphy has delivered the best acting performance in his career and florence pugh was stunning the cinematography is amazing the pomb scene was so sudden and unexpected I really loved it. Best acting performance ive ever seen in my entire life robert downy junior deserves an oscar.Cillian murphy has delivered the best acting performance in his career and florence pugh was stunning the cinematography is amazing the pomb scene was so sudden and unexpected I really loved it. Best movie this year and it could be best movie in this century.
"I have a mix feeling about the movie.The 1st half of the movie feels like collection of tiktok/IG reels.With jumps going so fast, it was harder to focus on any one character or character development or story flow.It felt like the movie was going for punch line to punch lines like ""the world with end with this bomb"" and so on.They built the Los Alamos, but if you have no idea why Los Alamos was built, the security, the secrecy, the bare bone structure of the city, the long and hard working hours of the scientist there, then from those jumping scenes, it was hard to understand the importance of Los Alamos.Same way Niels Bohr flew from Germany, but the actor had a big smile on his face and he was asking can you make a bigger bomb. I mean, what was the reason behind him asking if the bomb is big enough. Why was Niels Bohr character even there, and why was he smiling.Also, from jumping of scenes, it was also hard to grasp that it took them 2-3 yrs of long working days to finish the gadget. There was no sense of time how much they spent time in Los Alamos.Like always Nolan's movie has of late got a real high music to the end that it has become difficult to hear the dialogues. If you don't have clear understanding of what happened from other sources, then the 1st half of the movie just felt like giving you an overview of the history but with a lot of jumps back and forth.The 2nd half of the movie after the test gets better. They take time in scenes to develop a narrative enough before jumping to next scene.I will definitely recommend watching season 1 of ""Manhattan"" tv show before watching the movie."
"We have talking, more talking, again talking, then a bomb and then again talking talking talking.Plus confusing time zone mix-ups, women characters who are next to nothing (kind of a trademark of CN),
a soundtrack which is waaaay to much for this kind of biopic, a try to take all of his live into the movie and delivering next to nothing at all, a character study which isn't really one (since you don't know nothing about Oppenheimer by the end and what it did to him on a personal level) and you need to be prepared with his live before the movie otherwise you are missing to much.So in short: Not his best, not the masterpiece everyone wants it to be and the hype suggest. But please go and see it for yourself."
"Enjoyable things a person can do. When we feel joy, we watch a movie, and on holidays and feasts, we watch movies. Even when we feel depressed, we can only see a movie.Also, movies represent a lot of memories. When we were young and we lived with our parents, the family would gather to watch a nice movie.And when we were going for a ride on the bus we were watching a movie on the way. What fond memories we remember when we watch these movies again. Watching movies is one of the most interesting and enjoyable things a person can do. When we feel joy, we watch a movie, and on holidays and feasts, we watch."
"This is Nolan's best film by far and Kilian Murphy's work is amazing. He played very inspiring, if not for Killian I think Oppenheimer would not be so interesting. I really liked the fact that this film, although about science, managed to combine love, humor, and much more, and the viewer does not get bored watching the film. Every minute is interesting as Nolan himself stated. I'm still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar. This film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world's trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him. Murphy's portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan's push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top. Some viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end."
"I cannot find a word to express how I felt watching the movie, and not even a word to explain how I felt after. This film is at the top of the top, I believe this might be the best film in history and I am serious about that. I even feel grateful for being able to experience this journey. Nolan simply doesn't stop impressing, and I would like to thank him for creating this masterpiece. Cillian Murphy delivered the best performance I've seen, he was incredible. They deserve the oscars.The cinematography and sound was out of this world, you have to experience this work of art in the biggest cinema screen you can find, of course, better if it is 70mm IMAX."
"This movie is a literal masterpiece. One of the best movies I have seen. The story is truly astonishing, the cinematography wonderful. It feels like there is always something happening in the movie, its a complex story with lots of ups and downs but i you actually get the story and what is happening, it feels like a truly amazing film. Probably will be the best movie of the year. I will recommend this film to anyone just maybe not children under 14 because of sex scenes in some parts of the movie. I love to watch it again and experience this astonishing movie. I cant say nothing more than just go and watch the movie, cant say anything about it."
"This film is great. Visually Stunning. Sound Mixing is top tier. I saw this a day before theatrical release in IMAX and if you want to get the full IMAX Experience, let it be this one. Whether you see it in IMAX or not you will fall in love with this film. But seeing it the way it was intended to be seen, it is an other worldly experience. The performances in this film are just phenomenal. Murphy is completely absorbed into this character and it is very clear through the screen. Emily Blunt also gives a very strong performance on screen, to be frank, she crushes it. Flat out. All I have to say is, see Oppenheimer in IMAX."
"Known for his science fiction, Christopher Nolan has always bent the boundaries when it comes to cinema. However, the way he managed to balance everything together was nothing short of almost perfect. There is no CGI in this movie, and the way he was able to capture a miniaturized explosion with that level of visual is just captivating. He's always been able to manage balancing innovative visual ideas and constantly manages to keep the story interesting while managing to respect the viewers themselves. When they test the bomb in the movie, I told my girlfriend to get ready and I had my feet braced like I was there for the test. What came next was silence and then pure power! The score to this film is beyond anything I've hear either. I was extremely interested when he chose to not to use Zimer as usual for his scoring of the film. However, Ludwig Goransson's music will have you melting in your seats. I've don't have the words to describe it. My head followed the camera. My ears were constantly on alert. The scenery was almost to good to be true. I really thought what he did with Dunkirk and stepping out of the sci-fi realm was his best work, but I can't wait to watch this again. 10/10."
"Hamilton (the musical) is special for many reasons: amazing sung, racially diverse, phenomenally written. But most of all, because it provided our current generations a modern connection to and humanization of the founding of our nation. Though it is about their primary author, the musical is as much a subtle honorific of the Federalist Papers and their philosophy, which in turn shaped the Constitution and our whole way of governance.Oppenheimer is poised to play a strikingly similar connection and humanization of the US' great international turning point, it's rise as a superpower due to the advent of the atomic age.Nolan crafts a powerful dramatic documentary of Oppenheimer's adult life. It is beautifully shot; fantastically acted; perfectly written and paced. The music is spectacular.The plot humanizes the creation of the most inhumane device every created by our species. It did not glorify, yet it also did not expressly vilify, being more content to tell the story of the man who would become known as the father of the atomic bomb, not just the story of the bomb itself. There is the trappings of McCarthyism and anti-communism. There are the mundane flaws of the man and those around him. But Nolan crafts the story and its telling to make these the conduit. Oppenheimer is never actually about the power of communism, or of love, or lust; it's about the power of the atom, and you feel that pull throughout.When taken in as a whole, Oppenheimer immerses you in the moments when our nation truly entered the stage as a terrifying force of power, and perhaps peace. I left with a sense of awe; amazement; perhaps a dash of fear, at the retelling of that piece of our history.There is still more to unpack with Oppenheimer- the cinematics, the sound, the production. How the reservations of the scientists ring hauntingly similar to the concerns raised by AI researchers and climate activists. Such a multi-faceted film, that this humble review on IMDB will leave for another time.Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant."
"I've read so many books, watched so many movies, listened so many songs about the Herosima and Nagasaki incident. But for the first time ever my eyes were wet when that bombing part came in and also after finishing this film. I really felt for the poor japanese, I really felt the same guilt that Oppenheimer felt. Also, the timing cycle, the shifts, twists and turns of telling the life story of him(Oppenheimer) was brilliant. That's the success of the director and the whole team. Moreover, this film is worth watching. Although it's more than 180 minutes, I don't think anybody will feel bored. It also contains a great message for the world leaders and a warning sign for the coming future. At last, I think this is one of the most important films of the twenty first century."
"I'm writing this a day after I watched this movie so I think it through)this movie is hard, strong, loud and chaotic.Nolan likes to play with time parallels so that's the thing that confused me in some way while watching.After watching you have a lot of questions about Oppenheimer, project, his kids life, other scientists future etc. It means you have to make a research after. And for me this is about plot holes, because I don't want this quantity of questions after watching a movie.""Oppenheimer"" isn't the best Nolan's movie, for me it's not even in top 3 (maybe even 5; incomparable with ""Inception"" or ""Interstellar"") but directing is obviously good.The cast is AMAZING (*love Matt Damon*), well played, incredible sound work, good picture quality.Conclusion: movie isn't that great and interesting, it's good, maybe will rewatch one more time."
"Too long and boring. Jumps all over the place from time to time and the viewers have no idea when something is happening and who's who. No mention of the horrific result after the bombing of Japan. The movie shows Oppenheimer like he's the victim here?? Two sex scenes and nudity that make zero sense to the story and don't fit into the style whatsoever. Three long hours and barely any mention about his private life. How did they get back their kid or how was he a ""womanizer"" exactly? The cherry on top is the guy who speaks with Russian (!!) accent when in fact he's playing a Hungarian.Overhyped. If it wasn't for the marketing, I bet that maybe 10% of the people would've actually seen it."
Was expecting a lot from C. Nolan but he didn't deliver as expected. Music score was alright. Bomb detonation scene was solid. But the scenes following the detonation were boring. Half the audience slept half way through the movie. I think they really stretched out the whole thing a bit too much. Endgame being 3 hours made the audience sir tight every frame but it's the exactly opposite for Oppenheimer. Should have been a 7 max but the Bomb detonation scene being filmed without CGI made it a 8. Compared to Interstellar or Inception this is 5 i swear. I love Nolan but this isn't what i expected.
"Best movie i seen in last 5 years
Thank you Mr. Christopher Nolan because every movie you made it is legendary , this movie will gona writen in the history of the cinema.There is something i want say it about people they want see action 😂😂 , it's a real story , he can't change the story because you want see action , but you can see it again alot of times to you can understand the story .The best thing in movie is the sound effects it's amazing and there's the nuclear radiation dosimeter , the sound is very good and accurate.Thank you for everyone who help Mr. Christopher to create this icon , especially The actors 🙏 .The movie was great so I give him 10/10."
"Saw it in IMAX 70mm film and it's staggering in that format. Truly one of the most incredible movie experiences I've ever had. Visually it's beautiful, and the audio in an IMAX theater has to be heard (and felt) to be believed.It's one of the most interesting movies you'll ever see, even apart from the spectacle of it. It was a 3 hour movie that didn't feel anywhere near 3 hours, to me. The performances were outstanding. Honestly, I know Cillian Murphy is supposed to get the lion's share of the plaudits (and for good reason), but Robert Downey Jr. Was equally as good, I thought.However...Florence Pugh's character, although acted well, serves absolutely no purpose whatsoever other than to have another female and someone to perform in a sex scene. The sex scenes do nothing other than fill Hollywood's quota for nudity, and they felt so out of place in this film. It seemed like Nolan went ""Alright, we've ticked the 'sex' and 'nudity' boxes, now we can kill her off"".I also wasn't wild about Gary Oldman as Truman. He's a great actor who just seemed like a poor choice for that role.Predictably, the military personnel and politicians are all portrayed as unfeeling, pushy, and manipulative. There's obviously some truth to that, but I would like to have seen them given a bit more nuance and their predicament more consideration. And McCarthyism is an old trope for anything set in this era. Another subject I'd like to see given more nuance than the almost cliche way it's always treated.But having said all that and those complaints aside, it's a spectacular movie that I'll definitely be watching again. I hope Christopher Nolan continues making them for a long time, because he's the best there is right now."
"In one's life some things that come along simply blow you away and this movie is one of those things,! The cast of this movie not only were well chosen and brilliant acted. This has to be seen. It's hard to review this movie and not give away too much, but it's a complete and immersive experience which also explains what goes on in the back ground. I simply knew that people built a nuclear bomb and that two of them were dropped on Japan which bought the end to world war 2. A terrible time in our history. The audience in the cinema we went to were very respectful and the brilliance of the movie is why I hope movies like this continue to be made."
"What more can anyone say about Nolan movies!just his name on any poster make it an instant classic and blockbuster
The cinematography is at its best and soundtrack is really good and the acting from Robert Downey Jr is spectacular! Him and Cillian Murphy will be nominated for the Oscars for sure, and Emily blunt was great specially in a scene nearing the end of the movie.I just didn't like that Nolan treat us as we are all scientist I felt a little bit lost in the first half of the movie, for me the second half was really better.But overall great experience you have to experience it in cinema!."
"I have just read an article from CNN where they say that Openheimer is a film about the history of the creation of the atomic bomb.Openheimer is the strongest film since The People v. Larry Flynt, about a man being judged by the US for thinking differently from what he was allowed to think. The atomic bomb is secondary. This is a brilliant movie. With a great script and a very good team of actors who flawlessly reveal their characters. Downey Jr. Is plays his best role.By the way, it is surprising that it came out right now. In a new round of the Cold War. This is probably why CNN is trying to simplify it so that prevent people from thinking like Openheimer."
"Not your typical Summer Blockbuster but WOW what an amazing movie. If your going in expecting a lot of explosions and action scenes, Tom Cruise has you covered.This is Nolan's historic epic that I was not expecting to have so much courtroom type drama. First off kudos to Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and Robert Downey Jr. They did an amazing job and all deserve an Oscar for their roles.Zimmer comes in with another killer score that fits the film perfectly, and Nolan is at his best here with non CGI visuals you never see in films these days.Their is A LOT of different characters and things happening at once in this film to help alleviate the 3 hour runtime. It's an important film and makes you think more than react.I can't say this film is absolutely perfect but I encourage anyone that has the patience to sit for 3+ hours to go see it in theatre's as the bomb scene itself did not disappoint and the acting/story make it worth the ticket price."
"Made an account just so I can hype up this masterpiece. The movie is a must-watch. Had me hooked from the very beginning. Nolan is an incredible director and even though I understand that some people may have had slightly different expectations, this movie serves incredible atmosphere, character complexity, story progression and depiction of monumental historical events, without any hint of romanticization. The cast was picked perfectly and served amazing acting. Personally I didn't find it too long, in fact it didn't feel like 3h at all. Would strongly recommend watching it in theaters rather than waiting to stream it at home. Also wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is not into history at all. No need to be a history buff, but would recommend looking up the some information about the Manhattan Project and everybody's involvement just for a better feel of the plot, though one can watch the movie without any prior knowledge whatsoever. The plot is rounded-up beautifully and it sparks further need for discussion and thinking, without feeling ambiguous."
"Quite a frustrating watch to be honest. Being a big fan of biopics, history, war, science, and Nolan, this film was going to be one to remember fondly. But it is not the case. As the film ends, I'm only thinking how it leaves much more to be desired.Oppenheimer - a character study interspersed with events surrounding the Manhattan Project which feels more like a minor secondary plot. Unemotional and rather jarring to the point where one might be tempted to use the word boring were the political and courtroom plots. By trying to blend in two stories, one being the Manhattan Project and the other being the political/courtroom drama, it fails to deliver on both sides. Can't help but think it would do much much better just focusing on one or the other. Deliver 100% on one story rather than 50% on two mushed in ones. Personally, I feel much more excited whenever the story progresses on the Manhattan Project-side - the building of the bomb, the work differences of the scientists/military/politicians, the morals, the ethical dilemmas, the politics of the project. The film builds on those aspects then, deflates into the courtroom-like scenes, taking steam off any real weight, emotions, and connections.However, it's not all bad. Nolan delivers on the technical filmmaking and the cast delivers on the acting. Film and filmmaking lovers will have much to enjoy and awards are almost guaranteed I dare say. The acting was the best part of the whole film. Needless to say, Cillian Murphy delivers as Oppenheimer himself and as many, many others mentioned, Robert Downey Jr. Also stands out.All in all, it still is a Christopher Nolan film and it shows. Though, it leaves much to be desired for as it aspired to be much more but can't. Just like my life."
"I was looking forward to this film, since I am a huge fan of Inception that I found really clever and thought provoking.Unfortunately, Oppenheimer didn't have any redeeming qualities that I can focus on.These were my issues: firstly, the first 30 minutes setting the scene were extremely slow and tedious and I started to wonder how I was going to sit through 3 hours. It did pick up in momentum after that, but in between had further periods of what felt like continual repetitive scenes where the audience isn't learning anything new.My second issue is that directors and producers of this film clearly have a lot more personal development, self reflection and evolution to do, as this film contains multiple scenes of unnecessary female nudity and yet the man shows nothing. Just another example of exploitation of the female body by Neanderthal humans. Furthermore, there was several scenes of a poor child suffering and crying, and in one scene the poor child's face was so red and swollen from constant crying that I was shocked and disheartened that the director would exploit this child to capture this unimportant scene. It really alarms me at how people are willing to degrade and harm other humans for their own selfish ego and gain.The third issue was the excessively loud bursts of background noise, that were randomly issued throughout. They were so loud that I had to literally put my fingers in my ears to protect my hearing.I do enjoy historical films and I would have scored it higher if the above mentioned weren't in the film.In hindsight, I wish I hadn't put my money towards the viewing of this film, as I don't like to support exploitation in any way."
"Where to begin..... Oppenheimer is a movie 3 hours long, Christopher Nolan has cleverly set the pace of the film to make it feel like you're only there for 2.Many bad reviews has said that they didn't like the almost documentary style aspect of it. This is anything but that, it is a clever stage really putting you in the mind of the main character as if you're there.A couple of times during the film there are scenes of silence, in this IMAX theatre filled with over 200 people no one made a sound everyone really immersed in the scene, even I had my breath literally taking away not breathing for the majority of some scenes.It is a must see film for anyone regardless of interest in physics or even world history. It poses an interesting dillema in your mind leaving you thinking of the movie hours later.A truly remarkable introspect into one of the most important person of the 20th century, Nolan has really made something special here."
"I've never watched a movie where i had to sit down after. I watched the movie with friends and whats crazy too there was no discussing the movie after. Everyone just sat down quietly and let that masterpiece sink in. Watched in in 70 mm and it was amazing. Felt like i was pulled into the story. The cast is elite, the screenplay is gorgeous to look at and the soundtrack fits the movie perfectly. I've read many criticisms about the pace but all i can say is that everyone i saw in the cinema was watching the movie amazed with undivided attention. The ending also was made so elegant that it blew my mind for a second. In conclusion: Oppenheimer is probably the best movie i've ever seen."
"One of the best movies that I have ever seen. Just amazing. Three hours of authentic Cinema.A great movie that keeps you glued to your seat from the beginning, telling us the story of a young physicist who will become transcendental in the history of the modern world. A 10 out of 10.Technically superlative, an outstanding photography and surround sound that immerses you completely in the story.Brilliant performance by Cillian Murphy, and also remarkable awesome cast. Great actors in every single shot.Nolan you did it again, maybe better than ever. Congratulations for such a masterpiece. I enjoyed it."
"Where do I start?From start to finish this film had me completely indulged in it and kept me craving for more.The music, the haunting and deep face of Murphy, the smooth like butter dialogues and the intensities of every shot makes this film Nolan's best ever.Also can't not mention R. D. Junior who was his best in this movie and gave an extraordinary performance.Cillian is brilliant. No more to say about that.Emily Blunt was also her best and showed just the right amount of emotions at the right moments. So did Pugh.Can't forget Gary Oldman's as per usual great performance. He definitely stole the scene with that one.The film was 3 hours long but felt like 1,5 to me! If that doesn't say enough about how great it was, don't know what will!Hats off to you, Mr Nolan!"
"This is the first time writing here and surely is worth it. Watched the movie last night, after running in two places to find a spot, but was well worth it. The way Nolan mastered to give us the life of Oppenheimer, played exceptionally by Merphy, was something extraordinary with all the ups and downs on his life. Also it has made a 3 plus hour movie run so smoothly like i could go for another 3. All the cast was very good, but again Cilian Merphy has outdone himself, the look on his eyes for most of the movie, it's giving me goosebumps even now that am writing this. And of course what can i say about the cinematography! Go watch it in the best screen you could find."
"Yet another massive achievement by Christopher Nolan; indeed a culmination of his entire life's work. Cillian Murphy exceeded expectations with his extraordinary performance. I'll be surprised if the man doesn't win an Oscar for this one. He was....something else. He was magical. The soundtrack was so brilliant, it almost carried the movie on its back; It made the simplest scenes/ shots of the movie SO incredibly powerful, I had goosebumps the entire time I was watching it. Every single actor (esp RDJ and Matt Damon) gave an incredibly special and memorable performance that I could not help but but wish to give them a big hug for the exceptional delivery. The movie was a tad bit long, but I believe that the extra time was needed to give the audience proper context, to ensure that the audience 'feels' the ending the way Nolan intended for them to. A masterpiece, truly."
"Best movie of the year by a country mile.... All the aspects of the movie is just great. The story telling, acting, score, screenplay, cinematography,editing... just brilliant. This has to be Nolans magnum opus. Tenet was not so goid.. Dunkirk was great... but this is just way ahead. His directing here is top notch.The movie seamlessly goes through different phases of the story. Cillian Murphy... well i dont have words to describe his performance. S definite oscsr contender. I just hope that this movie gets the reviews and accolades it deserves. It will definitely be an oscar contender. Lets see."
"It's very rare you come across any medium of art which captivates you with just one glance. And I can say for sure that Oppenheimer was that very reality. There is absolutely no doust that Nolan is a brilliant visionary and above all, he is a genius when it comes to story telling and cinematography. His mind bending techniques in movies are praiseworthy. In Oppenheimer he delivered everything to its finest be it the production, direction, cinematography or music. When it comes to acting, I want to applaud Cillian Murphy for his outstanding performance. With so much of screen time, his performance was nothing but a cohesive masterpiece. He is a wonderful and one of the finest actors we have and to see him give his heart and soul to this character truly makes you realize of his talent and passion for acting & movies. Emily Blunt, Robert DJ, and the entire supporting cast were at their best. The movie is a wonderful cohesion and amalgamation of pure excellence. It has to be one of the best movies we have seen in a longest while. Nolan as always lived upto the hype and it has to be one of his best works. It's a must watch and definitely a 10/10!!"
"There is much to be liked here and there are some incredible performances, especially from Murphy and Robert Downey Junior. Remar was a welcome addition and, despite his short appearance, brought a charm to the movie none of the others could do in all their screen time.All in all, the casting was great. The location scouting and cinematography too. Much of the movie was well composed of emotionally charged takes with some subtle inputs by the DOP and director.Where the film lacked was its on the nose quote ""I have become death..."" which everyone knows and due to its notoriety, could have been omitted from the final cut considering it isn't something everyone needs to be reminded of. These small additions let the movie down.It is apparent Nolan was attempting an artistic insertion, but not well pulled off and came across rather eye rolling, such as the sex sequence in the panel room, the emulation of a nuclear blast in the room too later on.But all in all, it's a great movie that is a must see. Though I can't imagine anyone watching it more than twice. Once in the cinema, once at home."
"I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan, and I was really excited to see his latest film, Oppenheimer. I drove 45 minutes to the theater to see it in IMAX, and I was prepared to be blown away.Unfortunately, I was not. I found the movie to be boring, slow-paced, and visually underwhelming. The explosions looked like they were from free stock video websites, and the acting was not particularly good.I think the main problem with the movie is that it is too long and too ambitious. Nolan tries to cram too much into the film, and as a result, it feels bloated and unfocused. The film also suffers from Nolan's trademark convoluted editing style, which makes it difficult to follow at times.If Nolan was not the director of this film, I would probably give it a 2 out of 5 stars. It is not a terrible movie, but it is definitely not one of Nolan's best."
"Christopher Nolan does it again Oppenheimer has got to be one of the best three hours that I've experienced in 2023. I was really excited about this movie when it was announced and it did not disappoint, even though it is three hours long I feel like that's the adequate amount of time that it needs. Cillian Murphy's performance of the character is just beautifully done, he nailed it. I was also a big fan of the music used in the background throughout the movie. It's just amazing the scenery that it takes place it's beautiful. I like how they tease you with the atomic bomb throughout the movie until the final moment. Cillian Murphy definitely deserve an Oscar for his performance."
"Master piece by the director. So many different angles to the movie and everyone's story seems to be true according to them. The Govt, the army, the physicists, the society all got their share, the chain reaction it started puts whole world on war. The music, intensity and picture quality is top class. The right moments, pauses and constant battle between conscience and duty. Right approach, right people and right team are must for any success. The whole world got another weapon that they can monetize and start a revolution. The little hints in dialogues and conversations are very well scripted."
"""Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to mankind. For this he was chained to a rock and tortured for eternity.""
What a way to start this rollercoaster. Christopher Nolan has more than succeeded in giving his audience what they expected with the epic biopic Oppenheimer, in which he revisits World War II after Dunkirk. As with all of Nolan's films, with the exception of a few glaring points, this is undoubtedly one of the best blockbusters to come out in recent years. While expecting a more understandable and plain editing compared to Nolan's other films since this being a history film, Oppenheimer was perhaps one of his most difficult films to follow. Nolan, who persistently refuses to make a movie in chronological order, avoided writing a linear screenplay for this movie as well.As he himself stated, Nolan, who wrote parts of the script in first person, conveys the film to the audience by intersecting many plot points from different time periods, including scenes with color that we see from Oppenheimer's subjective point of view, and black and white scenes where historical events are conveyed more objectively. Similar storytelling with his first big hit Memento but unlike that film this time it causes problems with the pacing of the intense three-hour story, with the inclusion of dozens of key characters and heavy dialogue. The film contains numerous side characters and putting all of their side stories on top of each other in the narrative is overwhelming from time to time. In this chosen narrative, which already is very deep and complex, missing a few small details causes the audience to not grasp the integrity of the story. From Oppenheimer's youth to the construction of Los Alamos, the pacing of the film was occasionally erratic. Some scenes felt like an endless trailer or like a documentary. Continuous and overwhelming dialogues made it difficult to acknowledge the whole plot of the story with the inconsistent pacing but in general, I would say that the film successfully fits this much material in 3 hours.The nudity used in Nolan's first R-rated movie since Insomnia in nearly 20 years seemed a little unnecessary. I find it ridiculous to use a section from Oppenheimer's famous monologue in one of these scenes. They've used the same famous quotes in the Trinity Test scene yet both times it failed to impress me. Oppenheimer's sex scene in the security hearing was also an odd choice that I didn't quite enjoy. I found it strange that Florence Pugh was used almost exclusively for nudity in this film, where I think we didn't had a chance to see her talent deservedly.Following the successful score on Tenet, Ludwig Göransson, whom Nolan trusted again, once again did an outstanding job. It is a masterpiece in itself, from Oppenheimer's soft and fascinating light theme starting from his youth, to dense violin sequences that intensify as we approach the Trinity Test. Göransson, who perfectly captured the core of the characters and the story from the beginning to the end of the film, takes the film to the next level with yet another unforgettable piece of art that allows us to integrate with the film on top of the already masterful, mind blowing sound mixing.As usual, most characters lack depth but as for the acting, in the rich casting of the movie, everyone was top-notch. With the exception of Florence Pugh not having enough screen time, Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. And Emily Blunt, who are among the biggest nominees for the Oscars this year, alongside Matt Damon, Benny Safdie, Rami Malek, Josh Hartnett, Jason Clarke, Alden Ehrenreich and Gary Oldman deserve individual praise for their tremendous performances. As an president once again, Gary Oldman had one of the most impressive roles despite having 2-3 minutes of screen time. And Jason Clarke just stole the spotlight troughout the entire film.For years Nolan received many criticisms for the lack of depth in general but especially for the female characters he wrote in his previous films but this time, Kitty Oppenheimer may be the most well-written female character in his filmography where it felt like she really had a voice.Working with Nolan for the fourth time, Hoyte van Hoytema's magnificent cinematography has some of the best set pieces I've ever seen. The climax of the movie, maybe the most impressive sequence I've ever experienced in the cinema, the Trinity Test scene, which I followed with my heart pounding with unbelievable tension despite all knowing what's going to happen. After that, the film runs flawlessly for me. Some people didn't like the fact that a new side story started right after the climax scene of the movie and it took about an hour to conclude that but I was very interested in the story where Lewis Strauss came to the action. It reminded me of the relationship between Mozart and Salieri in Amadeus which I
thoroughly enjoyed.The film manages to show Oppenheimer's narcissistic character, his political conflicts, his relationships with people and the change he went through after the bombing, his psychological state that changed with intense emotions, his nature as a human being as well as his regret.Concluding his biopic by putting the best possible end to this epic historical event with the powerful dialogues between Einstein and Oppenheimer as he stares at the rain drops ""causing chain reactions"" just like the opening scene, taking his complex storytelling to the next level and combining it with his best screenplay, Nolan is making his great return to the movies."
"This film changed me, christopher Noland art of the cinema is at its greatest here and this experience is second to none other than interstellar. If you can, watch it. While the plot can be slightly complicated after the moment (which is without a doubt the most nerveracking scene ever made) the film still maintains its unbelievably powerful nature. I am someone who is rarely emotionally affected by films however this film was the second to ever make me shed tears. While I was close to crying the entire film, it finally broke at the intense ending, which I believe will stay with me for the rest of my life."
"This film is a 100% accurate telling of oppenheimer from his early days of studying university of quantum theory right through to the day the he gets old and tells us the powerful yet terrifying story of the atomic bomb on hiroshima and the destruction it causes and how it destroys the life of its creator and the regret in his eyes that you witness after he's launched the bomb along with a haunting witness viewing of the film the soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful which fits really well with the soundtrack a few quotes I will never forget ""I have blood on my hands"" ""they won't fear it until they understand it"" ""they won't understand it until they've used it"" ""theory will only take you so far "" ""I don't know if we can be trusted for such a weapon but we have no choice"" you see his the breakdown of his relationships and people turn against him the entire government after what happens in hiroshima at the end you have a shot of oppenheimer in shock after the bomb hits hiroshima and the devastation that it has caused and the sadness and shock in his eyes which you see throughout the process of the bomb and regret and uncertainty from him and his scientists about what he's doing and the ending sums up his journey from the beginning to the aftermath of bomb and what he's done with an atomic weapon of mass destruction and they're plenty of stunning shots and at the beginning of the film you see hints of the bombs explosion which looks beautiful as well as terrifying and you see his ptsd affect him the trauma of the bomb that must have given him nightmares forever
This is a must watch a serious 1-1 documentation of oppenheimers life on the atomic weapon a must see for historians or anyone interested in Oppenheimers work I a stacked cast of well known faces that make the movie all the more interesting and its a rarity to see a lot of famous cast together in one big movie event Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer delivers a powerful. Performance as oppenheimer as you see the terror in his eyes and how he uses his eyes to act is just incredible and really does steal the show I hope that he gets nominated for an Oscar as he knocked it out of the park and the director the 🐐 christopher nolan who directed and produced this movie should get an Oscar for a scary ride of emotions of shock and fear throughout as I mentioned in my previous post the cast all do incredible with what they're given and deliver powerful performances like Jean tatlock and kitty and their character develoment with oppenheimer the sex scenes are powerful and beautiful to witness. The star studded cast is also what makes this film special and you feel like you are transporter back in time to this very moment this is a masterpiece I give this film a 9.5/10 a must see movie that I cannot recommend enough."
"Cillian Murphy was not an ordinary actor, he was a robot controlled by Chris to show the performance and personality in this way. At a moment I felt that this is the life of the real Cillian Murphy and not acting. I expect the Oscars to be settled for Killian. To be the highest rated movie in history. The film's shortcomings are few, including the way in narrating the events that is not considered a defect, because Chris liked to move between the past, present and future frequently. In the end, some people may not like this type of film, and this is normal, but I think that they are less than affecting such creativity. If you want a sentence to describe the movie (creativity at its best)"
"My husband and I watched this movie last night and it could not be any better. Right from the opening scene, the movie captivated us with its breathtaking cinematography and mesmerizing soundtrack, which heightened the emotional depth of each moment. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer was nothing short of exceptional, as he brilliantly conveyed the inner conflict and moral dilemmas faced by the scientist during his involvement in the Manhattan Project.The screenplay was intelligently crafted, seamlessly blending historical accuracy with moments of artistic liberty, resulting in a gripping narrative that kept us on the edge of our seats throughout. The film not only explored the scientific aspect of Oppenheimer's work but also delved into his personal life and the profound impact his choices had on the world."
"I had an exceptionally delightful day watching a movie by one of the greatest directors of our generation. This film truly captivated me, from the very first scene until the last. I must confess that when the movie concluded, I found myself gazing at the screen, with one thought endlessly repeating in my mind: how remarkably cruel people can be. It left me craving more of this masterful masterpiece. In this movie, Nolan presents the true battle between good and evil in a dramatically captivating way. The music in the film was absolutely outstanding, earning a perfect 10/10 rating. I wish there were more scenes of Jean."
"Before i start my review i have to say that the acting in the movie by all of the actors was phenomenal, specially Robert Downey junior. The sound design was on point, but the movie lagged behind in story telling and the way the story was portrayed.Most of the people wanted to know the story behind the successful Nuclear test, The use of bomb on Japan and the aftermath. But after the nuclear test was done the story was more focused on the court case on Oppenheimer and the politics behind it, and it went on for so long at the end, that it left a bitter taste. The take away of movie could have been the nuclear test and the sound design , but it rather was the monotonously long case that ended the movie (Again the acting was phenomenal and was one of the saving grace of the movie)."
"3 hours I can't get back. I fed into the hype. The countless news articles and YouTube videos about the movie. And then I watched it...Boy was I disappointed. I should've known better. Oppenheimer is a very boring and tedious film. It requires your FULL attention and I'm not a fan of that. The scenes were way too long and the pacing was slow as a snail. What did I expect? An action film or a thriller? It's a biography about the brilliant mind(s) behind one of the most pivotal moments in world history. Having said that, it doesn't make the movie likable in my opinion. On a positive note the acting and cinematography was great. Everything else was meh."
"Biopics are often well presented and offer a deep storyline to keep you immersed. Nolan rightly chose to work on this film as I believe it's the best film I've ever seen. I'm lost for words when asked to describe my experience and thought of this film and I often resort to simple vocabulary like ""it was amazing"" or ""I loved it"" and not many people will recognise what I truly mean by that. Oppenheimer, directed by Christopher Nolan is a story based solely around J. Robert Oppenheimer, a Quantum Physicist who played a large role in the development of the atomic bomb. The film explores his life, his work and it is all presented through his eyes."
"It is safe to say that this film is exceptional in every aspect: acclaimed director Christopher Nolan does not disappoint and brings to the big screen not only a film with a good historical narrative, but also a superb cast and, of course, a mind-blowing visual experience. However, it is important to keep in mind two aspects that for many could be negative and that I will discuss in this review after commenting on the positive aspects.The cast of the film is composed of exceptional actors and actresses such as Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Robert Downey Jr and more. Along with that, the film is directed by Christopher Nolan, author of great movies such as Interestellar, The Prestige, Memento, TENET... The entire team enhances the quality and credibility of the film through exceptional performances and an unparalleled visual and audio experience.The film's narrative is perfect, showing the reality of the historical events that took place in a detailed, dark and credible way, plus the perfect use of time by means of different chronological entry points. To bring this narrative to the big screen, Christopher Nolan once again surprises on a visual level without the use of CGI, reinterpreting on a smaller scale what happened in history thanks to his superb direction.Going into what could be negative aspects, even though the plot is superb, the pacing may not be perfect for many, as the film has a long running time, and is somewhat complex in its implementation of many characters and subplots. Moreover, especially for fans of the director, the film does not take the same approach as his previous films, but is different in that it deals with a detailed historical perspective rather than delving into fiction and final plot twists (there is something similar to this kind of plot twist, but in a different way).Having said all that, the film is a masterpiece that everyone should see and definitely will enjoy."
"Oppenheimer's depth and unique suffering is elegantly portrayed by Murphy in this Oscar-worth performance. Whether it is the minor facial expressions which represent a thousand thoughts or the surreal look in his eyes throughout the majority of the film.Along with this, Christopher Nolan has lived up to his expectations once again, and perhaps even surpassed them in this brilliant movie. This movie is not one for the plot, it is for the small details in how each scene is laid out, and how Oppenheimer reacts/develops in regard to these things. Nolan shows his skill in both these fields throughout the movie.Nevertheless, the only thing separating this movie from a 10 is strange plot pacing in the beginning. Not so poor that it ruins the film, but poor enough to keep the movie from receiving a 10."
"Oppenheimer is not just a movie, it is an experience. It is a movie that will take you on a journey through the mind and soul of the man who changed the course of history. The movie is a masterpiece of filmmaking, with amazing acting, directing, writing, and production. The movie is visually stunning, with scenes that will make you gasp, cry, and marvel. The movie is also audibly stunning, with sound effects and music that will make you feel every emotion and tension. The movie is not for the casual viewer, as it requires some prior knowledge of Oppenheimer and his era, and it does not shy away from the dark and disturbing aspects of his story. But if you are willing to invest your time and attention, you will be rewarded with a movie that will enrich your mind and touch your heart. Oppenheimer is a movie that you have to see on the big screen, as it is a spectacle that will blow you away. It is one of the most movies that I like, and I'm sure you will agree. This movie deserves all the praise and recognition it can get, and I hope you will give it a chance. Trust me, you won't regret it."
"Murphy and Robert both does an incredible performance. For how little Robert is actually on screen, he makes such an impact that he is always on ur mind.The film is long but makes up for it with great dialouge and acting, ur kind of always waiting and aching for the nuke to be built and used bc u now what will happen, but the scientist dont. The build up of the nuke, seeing exited scientist really working hard and the mixed emotions when they finally do it, is great. But how Nolan shows the aftermath of the nuke is something different. The emotions he conveys on screen through Murphy but also sound effects, editing and extras really is the closest thing ive ever felt to the horror of the atomic bomb, and we didnt even see it drop on Hiroshima or Nagasaki. It does a super job trying to feed u the exact feelings of Oppenheimer throughout the entire movie.If ur here to watch another sci fi film like Interstellar and Inception, ur probably gonna be bored, but that doesnt make the film bad. If u like historic biographical movies on the other hand, this is a must watch. And really consider watching it in a cinema with Dolby Atmos."
"Just back from a Dolby Screening of Oppenheimer and I thought it was a mind blowing experience and Nolan pulled a rabbit out of the hat with this team. Screenplay and editing made the movie move at a rapid pace despite the movie fundamentally is a dialogue driven drama. Technically its easily one of the best movies made. That includes cinematography, editing, sound mixing and visual effects.Speaking of performances Cillian is the MVP and he carries this dramatic endeavor brilliantly. I am hoping he wins the Best Actor award next year. Downey was the other one who was absolutely brilliant as a scheming senator. Rest of the cast were all good but did not stand out that much. Blunt had one great scene and Pugh did not have much to do. Damon was solid but his character did not stand out.I have to see this again preferably at a 70 mm Imax if I can get a ticket."
"Highly intriguing, best screenplay with Openheimer's state of mind in the centre.Gotta say, there were moments with pin drop silence, like literally across 120 people in IMAX! Needless to say which scene, but the main event of this picture logged the best experience of my life, I mean the level of silence with me in the middle of 120, it seemed people (including me) werent sure if that was something to be proud of or any other thought. I didnt had any thoughts or opinions on Openheimer's position throughout, it was the purest form of physical and psychological experience.Don't like to be a spoiler, so highly recommend this to be experienced in IMAX...!Thanks to the whole team for putting together such an epic!!"
"Thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Need to watch a lot of documentaries to understand and validate what was shown to be honest. Nonetheless this movie certainly will aid the people to develop sympathy for the father of atomic bomb and also make them scared of what's to come next. The cast was brilliant throughout the movie. Robert Downey Jr. Was so good as Lewis Strauss that you will feel the urge to punch his face. Words cant describe how amazing Cillian Murphy's acting was, you really need to see it to judge it. I always thought that we will remember him as Thomas Shelby but now that we have seen him as Robert Oppenheimer you might need to overwrite your memories."
"Maybe Nolan didn't want to show the war, but he could have displayed the lives lost (a few segments of the war with very little screen time would have been nice). To communicate to an audience who may have known very little about the war and the holocaust the urgency of Oppenheimer and others. He could have set up one of the most famous quotes ever a little better. My thoughts on that would have been for Oppenheimer to whisper it to Tatlock and to make sure the audience doesn't hear it until after Japan surrenders as his colleagues celebrate. The movie needed Zwick for the emotions of war and romance IMO. The good about this movie is the excellent performance of Murphy and the great cameos, including Oldman as Truman."
"I used to have respect for Nolan before I realized he doesn't embrace the change of times. It' very simple. You either embrace great changes, grow, and become better or you just become old news trapped in the past. And this is the case with Nolan.While all the great directors like Scorsese, Coppola, Cameron, Kosinski, McQuarrie, etc. Are shooting their great movies in 4-6K resolution digital IMAX cameras and Dolby ATMOS and DTS:X sound, Nolan is still trapped in the past with his stupid analog films and plain DTS-HD MA.And his story telling is just getting worse and worse and more boring. It's all part of the same symptoms of people who are just trapped in the past and can't learn to improve. You just can't teach some old dogs new tricks."
"Your concience and eyes should be fully on the screen . Even a glimpse of a wavering second may kick you out of the plot. Consider reading a little history of Oppenheimer before watching, if you wish not to be Barbie in Physics class. Nolan with his brilliance has once again portrayed a majestic work. Casting has been perfect and you must spot mainly Cilian Murphy , Robert Downey ,Emily blunt and Matt Damon. Nolan gave significance to each detail of these characters . The explotion and the physics behind is shown in an intersting way. Oppenheimer's psychological state before and after bombing has been observed closely. The political tensions at that time and the egocentric attitude of leaders are shown well. Casting has just been perfect and an average cinephile may know all. I strongly recommend everyone to watch ."

"This is Nolan's magnum opus. A beautiful movie visually; with a haunting, attacking, physical score. The acting is elite, specially Murphy who is at his apex as an actor. There are so many actors in this movie who you've seen elsewhere but have no idea what they're names are - and all of them hit out of the park. I left the movie theater defeated mentally and emotionally. The intentions were to do Barbie later in the day, but after watching this masterpiece I didn't want to do anything but sit and ponder. I must suggest seeing this movie in IMAX to get the full experience. 10/10, 5 stars, all the awards."
"This movie... the values it portrays and the history it has combined with the brilliance of C. Nolan, Van Hoytema and the cast put it into the 'must see' section.It showcases the negatives of capitalism and all wars. It brilliantly showcase of what happens to a person whether they're a genius of Oppenheimer's ranks or not, when they have to choose between evils, the only difference being one will be attributed to them while under their control at the same time.The movie's presence today is more than needed, in a time which can be defined by rapid change. Oppenheimer reminds the audience to always thoroughly think about their options while deciding.The film, of high quality, has deep thoughts scattered all through it. A 10 out of 10 class."
"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a sweeping, epic biopic that tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who led the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb. The film is a visual and intellectual tour-de-force, with Cillian Murphy giving a tour-de-force performance as Oppenheimer.The film begins with Oppenheimer as a young man, studying physics at Harvard. We see his early brilliance, his love of science, and his idealistic commitment to using his knowledge to make the world a better place. As the war progresses, Oppenheimer is recruited to lead the Manhattan Project, a top-secret effort to develop an atomic bomb. The film follows Oppenheimer as he leads this team of scientists, working day and night to create a weapon that could change the course of history.The film is not afraid to show the dark side of Oppenheimer's work. We see the moral and ethical dilemmas that he faces, as he grapples with the implications of creating a weapon of such destructive power. We also see the toll that this work takes on him, both physically and mentally.Oppenheimer is a complex and challenging film, but it is also a deeply rewarding one. It is a film that asks big questions about the nature of power, the responsibility of scientists, and the dangers of nuclear weapons. It is a film that will stay with you long after you have seen it.**10/10****Pros:*** Cillian Murphy's tour-de-force performance
* Stunning visuals
* Thought-provoking story
* Powerful performances from the supporting cast
* Christopher Nolan's masterful direction**Cons:*** The film is long (nearly three hours)
* Some of the scientific jargon may be difficult to follow**Overall:**Oppenheimer is a must-see for fans of Christopher Nolan, Cillian Murphy, and historical dramas. It is a film that will stay with you long after you have seen it.**Here are some additional thoughts on the film:*** The film's visuals are stunning.

"In ""Oppenheimer"", Christopher Nolan brings to life a very deep and complex character. Unlike Nolan's usual style, this film has a lot of dialogues. It deals with many big issues like guilt, logical thinking, patriotism, and the effects of creating a nuclear bomb. The film also highlights the dark side of peace, hypocrisy, and double standards in morality.""Oppenheimer"" is a balanced film about a controversial figure. The movie's quality lies not just in the accurate storytelling and fair representation of events, but also in the quality of its scriptwriting.The story in ""Oppenheimer"" is not easy to follow because it jumps between different times. We get to see the process of making the bomb, the years after it was used, and how these events affected Oppenheimer's life, especially his mental state. The film focuses on Robert Oppenheimer's personal struggle and the heavy responsibility he carried.The film is very complete, whether you look at it as a historical movie or as a well-done adaptation. Nolan once again shows his skill in getting the best out of his actors.The last part of the film is a true artistic masterpiece, with smooth transitions between scenes and a great soundtrack. While the music isn't the best in Nolan's films, the sound effects are definitely top-notch. The film is also visually pleasing, with real explosions instead of CGI, which adds more artistic value.To wrap up, after less successful films like ""Dunkirk"" and ""Tenet"", Nolan took a big risk with ""Oppenheimer"". His bravery paid off and he proved that he still has more to offer in his films.8/10."
"The story was amazing and great acting,directing I'm sure will Oppenheimer to nominees for best actor, best supporting actor,best director,best sound, best cinematography, best picture, my favorite Christopher nolan movie ever , cillian murphy acting was great my rating for Oppenheimer 9.5/10. It's a wonderful experience for my life,one day I will become a director, my idol is Christopher nolan I genuinely believe the movie was done incredibly well but very much slow paced which is why most people dislike the film but I understood everything from beginning to end and the points that were made as well as by the end when Oppenheimer feared of his own creation finally settled in."
"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer delivers an immersive blend of sadness and fear, unfolding the nonlinear narrative of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life. The portrayal of human folly and pursuit of power is chilling. Pacing, sound, and editing create an unparalleled cinematic experience. Cillian Murphy's astonishing performance deserves Oscar. Robert Downey Jr. Shines as his complicated associate. Background knowledge enhances the film's impact. A future classic with a powerful historic message; challenges the audience to contemplate the consequences of human actions; a must-see for all film lovers."
"The acting of the cast was brilliant but it would have been better as a mini series which would have allowed for an exploration of topics that just have been glossed over in the movie. The timeline of events felt rushed, the psychological state of Oppenheimer and his questions about morality just scratched the surface. His relationships to e.g. The women in his life and brother were not further explored. Thus, the portrayal of Oppenheimer is stuck in a weird place between a one and three-dimensional character. A mini series would have added much more depth to an interesting, conflicted man as well as the historical context and events."
"Imagine arriving at the airport, ready to board a flight, only to discover that the plane has no engines. Consequently, there will be no trip. Well, this movie is no different. It lacks taste, is tedious, excessively long, and lacks a solid vision or cinematography. Christopher Nolan's amateurish script, underdeveloped characters, unnecessary soundtracks, and arrogant cinematic perspective have ruined the film. I fail to comprehend the overhyped praise surrounding this movie. Furthermore, the recommendation to watch it in IMAX theaters is baffling. Additionally, the movie focuses on Oppenheimer, yet even after enduring a lengthy three hours, there are numerous gaps in the storyline, leaving me feeling the need to conduct extensive research to grasp how and why these events occurred.I hold great admiration for Christopher Nolan's previous works such as ""The Prestige,"" ""Insomnia,"" ""Interstellar,"" and ""Inception,"" but this particular film is a major disappointment.As a side note, I was compelled to reserve my ticket 72 hours in advance due to the full capacity of IMAX theaters. However, I can confidently say that there is no discernible difference between watching this movie on a 6-inch cellphone or in an IMAX theater. Ultimately, there isn't a single visually captivating scene to savor!"
"A 3hrs long movie that won't bore you. Brilliant acting by cillian Murphy and all the great actors including blunt,damon etc. Such a wonderful cast. And the timeline and the progression of the movie was so amazing that it left the viewers in awe even till the very last moment. Amazing soundtrack and composition by ludwig. It has to be his perfect soundtrack. Even the last scene of the movie is soo satisfying that it leaves the audience in amazement. Use of black and white film was spot on. It correctly conveyed the subjective perspective of the two sides. Huge respect for nolans craft. Nevertheless, a nude scene in a movie like this was not really needed. Oppies extamarital affairs could have been conveyed without those scenes."
"""Oppenheimer"" (2023) is a biographical thriller, drawing inspiration from the 2005 biography ""American Prometheus."" The film intricately explores the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, an intellectual and charismatic physicist entrusted with leading the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, N. M., during World War II to develop the atomic bomb. The narrative centers on Oppenheimer's academic pursuits, his pivotal role in the Manhattan Project, and his eventual demise consequent to a 1954 security hearing. The director adeptly portrays Oppenheimer as a pivotal historical figure, yet poignantly naive, highlighting the profound gravity of the project and its profound repercussions on humanity.Cinematography and direction:
The cinematography of the film possesses a haunting quality, reminiscent of Christopher Nolan's distinctive style, imbuing it with an ominous atmosphere. Its non-linear storyline, coupled with a swift tempo and skillfully crafted narrative, effectively captivates the audience's attention. Nolan demonstrates his mastery by artfully interweaving revealing segments in lush colors and high-contrast black and white, forming a structure resembling the strands of a DNA double helix.Employing the terms ""fission"" and ""fusion,"" he skillfully accentuates the film's themes and introduces an element of complexity through chronological manipulation. Vivid scenes from various periods draw the audience deeply into Oppenheimer's tumultuous life, establishing this movie as unquestionably Nolan's Magnum Opus, showcasing his exceptional vision, meticulous attention to detail, and storytelling finesse. The adept pacing enables both action-packed moments and character-driven scenes to shine brightly throughout the film.The cast:
The film impresses with remarkable performances from its highly skilled ensemble cast. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of the conflicted hero, grappling with duty and personal challenges, is truly captivating. The supporting cast, including Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and other accomplished actors, deliver standout performances that infuse the narrative with depth and authenticity. The palpable chemistry among the cast members brings the characters vividly to life. Notably, even the extras are prominent figures, adding to the film's overall quality.Fantastic Audio Experience:
Ludwig Göransson's symphonic score enhances the film significantly by skillfully harmonizing with the on-screen action and intensifying emotional scenes. The expertly crafted sound effects create a captivating auditory experience, immersing the audience in the movie's world. The eerie and dreamlike tone establishes a tense atmosphere, enveloping viewers in the film's narrative. The exceptional score demands a full theatrical IMAX experience, providing an auditory delight that amplifies the film's overall impact.It pays tribute to the complex life of Oppenheimer and the profound impact of the Manhattan Project. Christopher Nolan's remarkable direction, combined with the stellar cast performances and the enchanting score, results in a film that leaves a lasting impression on its audience."
"The feel the look of the movie takes you to that time that era of history, the fast paced editing of dialogue scenes makes the movie exciting,even though the movie is very much based upon dialogues , conversations but short lenghth of scenes and fast paced editing takes down all the boredom & movie feels very fast. 3 hours long but time flies. Not 10 because of no action but that is understandable as the movie is a biopic. For the biopic genre also the movie feels very intelligent & brilliant, the screenplay is tightly written & the the non linear timeline makes you to give more attention to the screen as you don't want to loose & left behind. Christopher nolan never disappoints."
"""Oppenheimer"" is an extraordinary cinematic experience that leaves audiences awe-inspired with its mesmerizing visual elements. The film's visual prowess is unparalleled, taking viewers on a breathtaking journey through time. From the elaborate set designs to the captivating special effects, every frame is a work of art that transports you to the World War II era.However, what truly sets ""Oppenheimer"" apart is its impeccable audio work, masterfully synchronized with the movie. The sound design plays a pivotal role in creating an immersive experience. During the pivotal scene when the atomic bomb explodes, I was left utterly shocked by the sheer intensity of the moment. The synchronized sound wave reverberates through your very being, leaving you with a sense of awe and terror at the immense power of the event.The performances by the cast are exceptional, with the lead actor bringing J. Robert Oppenheimer's complex character to life with depth and emotion. The supporting cast adds layers of authenticity, making the narrative all the more compelling.The film's direction is commendable, skillfully weaving together historical accuracy and artistic vision.

""Oppenheimer"" is not just a movie; it's an intellectual and emotional journey that lingers in your thoughts long after the screen fades to black.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic marvel that impresses on all fronts. Its stunning visuals, exemplary audio work, and compelling storytelling make it a must-watch for any cinephile or history enthusiast. Be prepared to be moved, challenged, and deeply affected by this cinematic masterpiece."
"The Best of Christopher Nolan ever Made This Far.I called myself lucky to watch Oppenheimer on IMAX, this movie really satisfied my eyes and ears. Oppenheimer is beyond my expectations for biographical thriller film. And dont forget about the cast, because the cast was awesome and i cant describe the actors acting with my words. People have to watch this movie once in a lifetime on IMAX, and for the people who hasn't watch Oppenheimer. Please study the background of world war 2 ending and Oppenheimer himself. I really enjoyed this movie even though the duration of this film is three hours long."
"My favourite movie of all time is Christopher Nolan's 2008 Batman Dark Night. He did it again, delivering historical magic to the Imax cinematic world, and also changed our modern filmmaking method. Astonishing performance from Cillian, with beautiful cinematography capturing the magnificence of an atomic explosion. A refreshing and innovative film highlighting the challenges Oppenheimer faced as the person controlling the life and death of people through his invention, his struggles due to his background and his jealousy of his peers.I particularly love the usage of the B&W 70mm film describing the time frame of events, separating the present and the past, more importantly colouring the dynamic of people. B&W film separates characters from the background, drawing the focus to the facial expressions and movements of the actors. We see how Lewis's extraordinary performance on how his jealousy and delusion drove his anger towards Oppenheimer, how people are easily blinded by fame. Using handheld camera movement for most of the scene builds up the tension, in short truly immersive.Oppenheimer is known to be the father of the atomic bomb. In his previous interviews, he had expressed his concerns about the usage of these bombs and how his invention conflicted with his view on morality. He used his talent to invent such a bomb but everything comes with consequences. Likewise, a bomb can destroy or create destructions and contains greatness in good use but with massive consequences. Oppenheimer was aware of this fact, and the introduction visuals and after-effects complimented this conflicted feeling.The most breathtaking scene has to be the last scene. A close-up of Oppenheimer following an image of the world where it was covered with atomic bombs, end of the world. The fear lived within Oppenheimer. Another remarkable scene would be the explosion of the first successful atomic bomb. The scene started with clouds of dark gas, swallowing the sky, everything was silent, observing the power of it. Then soon later, a loud noise followed. Excellent method of immersing everyone to witness history, and the mightiness of the bomb alongside incredible soundtracks, creating an effect that could only be achieved in cinema.Yet this movie is not all about the process of how the atomic bomb was invented, it is a biography about Oppenheimer. The storyline includes his love affairs, marriage, family and politics. Oppenheimer had been accused of having a connection with the Russian communist party during the second world war. The majority of the movie was about his security clearance. Colleges of his were introduced one by one, some betrayed him, some told half-truths. A mentally draining trial for Oppenheimer but was important to the overall story as in the end cleared his name and his loyalty to the country.A great movie needs to provide a sense of connection with the audience, a reflection that the audience can carry even outside of the cinema. Oppenheimer is a must-watch movie though it is quite lengthy, a total of 3 hours. It gives you a glimpse of what it meant to be ""with great power comes with great responsibility"". The struggles behind the most magnificent invention of the century. Everything comes with a price, a price that Oppenheimer has to pay was his time with his children and family, and the betrayal of people he trusted. A phenomenal cast of actors, and I have nothing to critic about their delivery."
"I was fully in since the first scene, what an awesome movie. It's not my favourite Nolan movie, but its just so well made that its a ten for me. Just one of the highest quality movies I've ever seen. Performances are also fenomMost effective, however, is the use of sound and music. Like Jonathan Glazer's upcoming The Zone of Interest, this is a film in which the horrors of war are not shown but conveyed inescapably through what we hear. Ludwig Göransson's score is masterful and mercurial, surely one of the finest of the year. And there's a recurring motif in the soundscape, a crescendo of thunderously stamping feet. It's taken from a moment of triumph and glory, the high point of Oppenheimer's career. Enal, Im impressed by RDJ."
"MISSION: BARBENHEIMER PART 2 OF 3!In my review for Barbie, I mentioned that there was a standout winner this weekend and that winner is undeniably Oppenheimer - a bonafide masterpiece.This film impressed me on multiple levels, as it showcased exceptional production quality, outstanding performances, brilliant scoring, and impeccable cinematography.Hoyte van Hoytema, the cinematographer, has now secured a place among my favourites, given the way he expertly captured each scene.Ludwig Goransson's score was both breathtaking and cathartic, a stark contrast to his previous work which failed to impress me, particularly in Tenet where I disliked the score and sound design. However, in Oppenheimer, the execution of the score was flawless, with only two minor moments where the sound felt unnecessarily loud, although it didn't detract from the significance of those scenes. Despite this, I must admit that my ears felt numb and I experienced discomfort after the movie due to the volume.As for the direction, Christopher Nolan once again showcased his talent, delivering amazing work. While Oppenheimer may be considered his best film by some, my personal favorite will always be Interstellar.The film lived up to my expectations in terms of drama, blending court room drama with elements of science, politics, and relationships. The writing was exceptional, dispelling the notion that Nolan struggles with female characters. Although females aren't the central focus of the story, had they been, I have no doubt that he would have written them well.Among my favourite moments were the captivating discussions on science and the stunning quantum visuals with roaring sound design as particles interacted. These scenes were simply incredible and left a lasting impression.One of the most beautiful shots in the entire film was the black and white scene where Oppenheimer met Einstein, evoking a raw and real-life atmosphere reminiscent of shots from films like Andrei Rublev.The acting was simply outstanding. Cillian Murphy, whom I previously considered somewhat overrated, surprised me with his depth and ability to convey emotions through his eyes. Emily Blunt was fantastic, and Robert Downey Jr. Delivered his best performance to date. Any claims of overacting made by some movie critics, including those who supposedly attended film school, are simply ludicrous. Robert Downey Jr.'s performance was truly phenomenal, and there's no denying this fact.I can't stress enough how much I enjoyed Oppenheimer, which instantly became my favourite movie of 2023 so far. It was a fantastic experience, and while it had a few flaws, such as unnecessary nudity and sex scenes, these did not overshadow its many other outstanding qualities.To sum up, Oppenheimer is an impressive film that deserves the highest praise. It has set itself apart as the clear and decisive winner when compared to other movies, even overshadowing my previous anticipation for Barbie. This cinematic experience left me incredibly satisfied and thrilled, and I can't wait to see how it continues to resonate with audiences."
"Good movie, glad I saw it.I did not think it was quite as great as perhaps I had expected, though. As someone who has studied some physics, I would have liked to see a lot more of it. I did like the casting of all the famous physicists whose names I know well, but that too could have been milked a little more. And there were many things at Los Alamos that would have added nice context (like the ""demon core"" and its victims. And a clearer explanation of the fact that they only tested the plutonium bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki; the Uranium bomb needed no testing; they knew it would work, and it did - on Hiroshima).And three hours is long: the story about the loss of his security clearance took, I think, much longer than would have been needed. I thought ""OK yes, he's being screwed; he'll lose the clearance"" - and then it took another hour to ever so slowly get to that point.And the constant going back and forth in time was also sometimes frustratingly confusing."
"I watched this film. I went to see this film considering it as a film made on science fiction and scientific community, but in this 3-hour film, the story went on for only 15 to 20 minutes, after that there was a heated debate about American communist politics in closed rooms.I had read that Oppenheimer had an affinity for Bhagwat Gita but added that too to his sex scene.Those who are in the mood to watch it as a film based on the research of atomic bomb, they will find it very boring, but those who are interested in American communist politics, they might like something.But acting of Cillian Muphy was excellent."

"Just had the most INCREDIBLE movie in years! Mesmerized by the visuals, and the SOUNDTRACK? It had my heart pounding the whole time! And let's talk about Cillian Murphy's eyes. Deserve an Oscar all on their own! Chris Nolan's brilliance shines through again! This is one of the best movies you will ever watch. Cillian absolutely steals the show. I have never imagined Robert Downey Jr. Giving such an immaculate performance. Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and all other supporting casts did an incredible job. A huge thanks to Chris and the incredible cast & crew for giving us this unbelievable cinematic experience."
"My one word review - Brilliant. My Rating - 9/10. It is surely Nolan's finest and most powerful movie till date and will likely be the big winner at next year's Oscars at least for Best Film, Best Actor, Best Director and Best Supporting Actor but it is not a movie for everyone.Cillian Murphy gives his best performance as he completely immerses himself into this complex character. The direction, acting, music, visuals and overall story is simply magnificent. The movie is an extremely gripping thriller which keeps its viewers hooked to the screen for the entirety of its 3 hour screen time.Nolan's storytelling style with multiple parallel storylines pays off at the end but it is a bit complex in the first half and its intentionally slow pace may be a turn off for audiences not used to Nolan's brand of cinema. If you like good artistic and content heavy cinema, then this movie is the perfect theatrical experience."
"First of all, everything that follows is my personal opinion, everyone can have a different opinion and that's a good thing. The complexity of the film is a major point of criticism for many, which I can understand in some ways, although I see it differently. Because the complexity of Nolan's films is why I love them so much. It's a change from the dull action films that are too haf produced. It is true that Oppenheimer is also mentally demanding and makes your head pound, however me and my 4 friends (all 15 years old) enjoyed the film very much and learned a lot about the story of this brilliant man and the film despite the well understood at different time levels. Not completely, of course, but you have to be prepared for that with a Nolan film. One can't rave enough about the acting cillian murphy and robert downey jr's performance was absolutely superb and definitely worthy of an Oscar. The rest of the cast is also incredibly strong. I thought every 5 minutes ""what? You're playing too?"". And as if that weren't enough, everything is staged in an absolutely grandiose way and during one scene my mouth just dropped open and I just asked myself ""how???"". And last but not least, the absolutely ingeniously adapted music makes every single scene perfect."
"Okay so I watched Oppenheimer twice. The first time in 70mm and to be very honest ... I didn't like it the first time around. I felt it to be slow paced and confusing at times with a lot of things happening at once. It honestly felt like a documentary. However, I also like close to one of the world's 30 cinemas that project the movie in IMAX 70mm and I had booked the tickets a month earlier. When I tried to get a refund and cancel the tickets after watching the movie the first time, the customer service at the cinema said that they couldn't cancel my ticket at the moment, and the cancellation was only possible after the movie had been played and my ticket shouldn't be scanned. So I decided to go again as I thought it was a once in a lifetime experience.Oh my god, the second time the movie felt awesome. Although I watched it in the best possible way, I certainly like the movie the second time. Catch on the things I missed the first time I really appreciated the cinematography and the direction of the movie. The second time the movie didn't feel at all slow and everything fit in perfectly. I was able to better understand the characters point of view, and what they were thinking.So I would recommended if possible watch it twice to understand the true beauty Oppenheimer holds. Thanks."
"Oppenheimer was a great and very well crafted historical interpretation from Chris Nolan. Even as someone who doesn't know the ins and outs of this particular era of history, this movie served as a great look into the past. I had been waiting to see this movie for months ever since I heard it was going to be released in July. I think that with other movies that are highly anticipated sometimes they let you down even if they aren't that bad, it's just because they weren't perfect. In this case the anticipation was not a problem and after the movie I can wholeheartedly say this is one of if not the best movie I've ever seen, not only in theatres but ever.Cinematography: 10/10
Acting: 10/10
Everything else 10/10."
"When I got out of the movie, I thought well... will i watch another movie with this whole Cinematic creative power ? It is good in dialogue, scenarios, producing music and great characters. The only thing that can be considered negative is the acceleration of the dialogues in the last hours, but this obstacle does not prevent from watch this again. This masterpiece does not appreciate its existence outside cinema halls, especially IMAX, Finally, the film is not for fans of action ratings. It tells about Oppenheimer's autobiography in the Manhattan Project, and how his life was before and after the bomb, with regard to political issues, betrayal of the country, and physics as well, where you will live a very nice experience in case you have a background in history regarding the issue of the American and Russian allies. An enjoyable experience, I hope you enjoy."
"Incredible! One of the best ever, by far. This movie is must see at least 2 times. Anyone who gives this less than a 10 does not deserve to review movies. Undeniably a Nolan movie. The color, score, acting, and writing is perfect. Line delivery is perfect and you can tell how much Nolan cares about this story. The way it was set up and then ended was perfect. I really can't explain how transfixed I was during this movie. Cilian is the best I have ever seen him in any role. This story was a difficult subject that required sensitivity and he delivered at an exceptional level. He did not make Oppenheimer evil, he showed he was a man who had struggles and ended up being one of the most important people in history."
"If you take out all the hype and all the famous actor. The movie its just a 6. Good sounds, good camera. But the movie itself its not the best Christopher Nolan movie, so my best bet its that the hype its just a popular opinion affected by the hype of everyone and all the actors involed.As a Christopher Nolan movie, i was waiting some more action or at least a recreation of the bomb at Japan. But not even that.Also the movie its a bit too long. Probably they can cut like 20 min of the movie and the result would have been the same.I hope people read this to not go to see the movie with a big hype."
"This movie is very well done and the actors are top notch. Excellent soundtrack! However, it is rather boring. Like an unnecessarily long, overly complicated, theatrical documentary. Beforehand I was concerned that I might have to go for a toilet break during the THREE HOURS. Turns out I didn't, but I could have gone anytime between minute 30-90 and basically in the whole last hour. Also, Emily Blunt's obvious Botox/fillers really disturbed the experience for me - it made me very aware of the fact that I was watching an actress and not the character. I get the whole ""double punishment"" debate but don't think it has a place in the movie industry without context. It only messes with the absurd beauty standards even more to normalise it."
"Oppenheimer, almost feels like he was made for Christopher Nolan. For once in a Nolan film, he doesn't have to come up with a larger than life idea, with a complicated man at the helm of it. Because that kind of story, the kind Nolan seems to be so interested in, was Oppenheimer's life.There's a level of technical prowess to this film that's impressive even for Nolan. People have gotten so used to Nolan's technical ability, they almost ignore it, but this film doesn't allow you to, it is on another level. Without even commenting too much on the obvious 70mm IMAX film (I sadly was unable to see it), which is such an achievement for filmmaking going forward. The faced paced editing, breathtaking cinematography and practical effects so good you forget it's a movie. This movie is a technical masterpiece and that's clear as day even on a first viewing.And it goes without saying the acting will go down in history. Too many amazing supporting roles to even nominate all of them, and a lead so unbelievably good, it will redefine who people think of when they think of Oppenheimer. Cillian Murphy shows up almost immediately as the film starts, and he doesn't leave your mind for the week after it finishes.The SOUND, THE GODDAMN SOUND. Wether it's the sound design or the score itself. A score that rivals Zimmer's work with Nolan is score to die for, filling the room with anxiety when it needs to, and a feeling of grandiose when it needs to. The theater shakes and rumbles, the sound of a bomb, the sound of a hand on the shoulder, or the sound of a gust of wind, you can feel all of it. It's sad to say it but outside of the theater this movie will be a bastardized version of itself, and that's mostly because the sounds of an IMAX screening, make this one of the most riveting movies ever made.All of that is impressive, all of that can make a masterpiece, but at the end of the day, this is Oppenheimer. The story is what makes it all mean something, and what makes it so compelling. A beautifully dramatized version of history, with the truth still intact. Told in classic Nolan fashion, non-linear and labyrinthine. Told at a break-neck speed, through multiples lenses, keeping you guessing, which is nearly unheard of in a biopic. I said it's almost like Oppenheimer was made for Nolan. But in truth, it's stories like Oppenheimer's that make people like Nolan do what he does. I feel as if I've witnessed a classic at it's birth. Which is the first time I can say that in my young life. I went to the theaters and saw something come to fruition, Oppenheimer, a film we will definitely remember."
"This film is nothing short of spectacular. It is obvious that every detail has been painstakingly thought of to a very high degree and nothing is either done or not done accidentally.The film is breathtaking in many aspects. Chief of which is its ability to immerse you utterly. To make this possible, the film is created with accuracy in the visuals, the sound and sound stage, the on-screen content, and believable characterisation. Having watched several period interviews of Oppenheimer, I can believe entirely the manner in which Murphy portrays him. This same excellence can be found in every other part in the film, and every corresponding actor or actress' performance.I cannot fully yet describe my complete feelings about my experience yet, and I do not expect to be in a position to until I have had several days to think about it and possibly see the film again to digest the poignancy of the morals displayed so expertly by the cast in the finished product.To summarise: Do yourself a favour and watch this film! (In IMAX if possible)"
"Oh boy where do I even begin.Let's begin with some numbers.Cinematography 10/10
Casting 10/10
Sound design 10/10
Phase of the movie 9/10First of all this was a cinematographically astonishing masterpiece. Beautiful shots that captivated the perfect amount of info needed. Beautiful wide lens shots all The way down to Cillian's face, blurred. Sound designing was top of the top notch. I don't know how I even describe the massive chills you get from combining massive implosion of the bomb and the silence the movie had while you can clearly see the implosion/explosion, waiting for the upcoming sound of 'boom'. The effects of neutrons colliding or the massive wall of flame when the detonation eventually happens. Wow.---The movie itself was kind of up-and-down paced. Hoped for more 'action', but it had the necessary amount of action. I could feel my whole body was sweating from the anticipation of the detonation scene.Nolan really came up with perfect example of how person can feel inside while experiencing a dissosiatitive moment combined with trauma.Acting was flawless. Just shows how much money went into the prodiction when you can see just brief moments from Oldman and Malek. Cast was perfect."
"Christopher Nolan's first biopic keeps very true to its inspiration, American Prometheus. The casting was superb with what is Cillian Murphy's best performance on the big screen so far, and additional stellar performances from Robert Downey Jr and the remainder of the cast.The pace of the movie mirrors perfectly what J. R. Oppenheimer and the rest of the Manhattan Project must have felt racing to create this weapon of mass destruction first. The continuous shift through scenes, the fast dialogue, and the changing sceneries between Oppenheimer's life before and during the Manhattan Project (filmed in colour) and the security hearing (filmed in B/W) keeps the audience gripped to their seats, much like how the savants were gripped to their pads and blackboards trying to develop this weapon.For a historically accurate biopic, I must say it is ridden with a plethora of small and large metaphors: the security hearing being filmed in B/W showing a more basic right or wrong (loyal or communist) perspective of Oppenheimer; the constant imagery of rain droplets, almost signifying the thousands of ICBMs carrying nuclear warhead, pummelling the earth; etc.My only slight disapproval with the movie is that for such a long feature (3 hours) it leaves very little breathing room for the audience to digest the information given, so you must come prepared to dedicate 3 hours of undivided attention to this film in order to honestly appreciate and enjoy it.J. R. Oppenheimer truly is a modern day Prometheus and Nolan has masterfully managed to not indulge either side; misunderstood scientist and hero, or a man with blood on his hands and no remorse. Personally I like one of the ending scenes when Nolan finally reveals what Oppenheimer told Einstein: they did set off a never-ending chain reaction, just not in the molecular form they expected but by the means of mass proliferation of nuclear weapons."
"I'm a Nolan fan. I can't say this review is without its Bias.Particularly I love his ideas: time travel, dream inception, etc. Dunkirk was his first ""non-fiction"" I believe. And I loved it.I loved this one more.It was absolutely incredible and harrowing to watch one of the world's worst but most significant changes unfold over a stunning 3 hours. Every actor is in their prime. Absolute masterclass of sound, cinematography, editing, acting, and directing.There were moments where my theater laughed, and times when I saw people jump from fright. When the credits rolled, it really wasn't a time for applause, or a time to breathe a sigh of relief that the film had ended. It was a collection of souls, lost, after having watched humanity's most horrifying turning point portrayed with such realistic horror."
"I'm really glad to see the impact that this movie had on me, a wonderful drama movie. Everything in this movie is simply perfect, like every Nolan's movie we can find the time notion representated by clock sounds throughout the movie. Cillian was just the best choice for this, he plays Robert Oppenheimer like a deus and he knows how to reach people's heart thanks to his facials expressions, we know instantly feel the differents emotions of his character. We come to realize the remorse that Robert may have had after the launching of the A-bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in a very psychological short scene. Psychology is an integral part of this film since it is centered on a character in thirst for creation who does not realize the harm he could create by doing so. In short this film is quite representative of the works of oppenheimer and i strongly invite you to go see it."
"To begin with, this movie truly exceeded all expectations, captivating the audience with its mesmerizing musical score and the awe-inspiring performance delivered by Cillian Murphy in the role of Oppenheimer. Spanning over a duration of three hours, this cinematic masterpiece managed to effortlessly immerse viewers, making time fly by unnoticed as the engrossing narrative kept us yearning for more. The anticipation leading up to the trinity test was undeniably one of the most thrilling and suspenseful moments I've ever experienced in a cinema, leaving a lasting impression of ""feeling the nuke"", the story's conclusion struck a perfect balance of terror and brilliance, solidifying its place as one of the most chilling yet satisfying endings I've ever witnessed."
"I really can find the right words to describe how beautiful this movie is , for me it's the best movie I've ever seen and the soundtracks are extremely beautiful and it feels like you are living in another universe. What a bloody brilliant film and amazing actors. I never knew the story but I wanted to laugh, cry and shout at the screen. Such a powerful important story that's everyone needs to see and believe me you won't be able to watch any movie after this movie for a while. Nolan is hands down a freaking genius. I literally enjoyed every second, detail, character and soundtrack. This movie hits different."
"I love Nolan but this movie did not do it for me! I was very disappointed after spending 3 hours in the cinema. First of all I really liked the setting, the story and the actors. Music was great too. That's pretty much it.The rest: The story telling was just terrible. I was not emotional involved in the main character or any characters. I did not get to know who Oppenheimer really was. I was neither moved nor touched by the story.Too much dialoge, too many names, too many characters, so many time jumps. All of this made this movie far too complicated although the plot itself is not complicated at all... it felt very forced.It was also very irritating to me that Robert Downey Jr.'s character was given so much time and space in the film. I did not care about this ""Strauss"" character ... as the movie is about Oppenheimer?!In my opinion the story revolves too much about the trial. It is about a man who built a deadly weapon and killed nearly 120.000 people... who cares if he was a communist or not? Totally missed the point, in my opinion.Also why would you film everything in IMAX cameras if most of the plot is happening in an interrogation room?! You could totally watch it in a normal cinema.....So overall not great!"
"I don't know what compelled me to watch this movie in theatre IMAX. They truly spend a lot on marketing, and it worked. I was one of those who thought Tenet was one of the worst movies ever made, but I gave Nolan the benefit of the doubt because of Interstellar. Lo and behold, he went right ahead and made another long and pointless movie about nothing.This movie was SO BORING. The only thing that stopped people from sleeping in the theatre was the upbeat soundtrack throughout the whole movie (Literally upbeat music was playing from start to finish over a very boring storyline and dialogue).I'm writing this review after coming back home on a Saturday afternoon, hoping it stops someone from making the same mistake I made. Avoid it like cancer. Not because of saving your money, but to save your precious time. Don't even watch it at home.I went in the theatre, and I came out without gaining anything. In fact, some part of me died in there because of the absolute waste of talent in that picture. I don't know what it was, but it certainly wasn't what cinema ought to be.Nolan, you fooled me twice! I hope you quit and spare people from your future ""movies""."
"I literally have no words to describe the movie.It was so enigmatic and exciting, I wasn't even able to take my eyes off the screen.Every single second of the movie had me invested.Robert Downey Jr played an amazing role, I would say this character is one of the greatest characters Robert has played in any movie.I have no words for Cillian, he was just outstanding. The portrayal, the acting, the emotions, everything was 10/10.Every single character portrayal was beyond excellent, whether it be Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek....the list would not end, every single character was so good.I would say it's a must watch movie.Christopher Nolan never disappoints as always..."
"This is incredibly good nolan made a masterpiece but if u didn't know science at all u maybe won't get the movie.The cast were doing something it's stick in your head for a long time. Cillian Murphy act was magnificent , he was soooo goood and also Robert Downey Jr literally was doing a masterpiece i am advising you watch this movieWhen i am saying it's a masterpiece u should believe meTbh Oppenheimer is not for everyone because it's filled Dialogues and you must stay focus because maybe if you messed something in the movie maybe you won't get it until the end of the movieoppenheimer will take the oscar."
"In a world where legendary filmmakers clash, Christopher Nolan once again emerges as the victor, maintaining an undefeated streak with his latest masterpiece-a biopic that delves deeply into the psyche of an extraordinary character. Nolan's brilliance shines through flawlessly executed editing, captivating sound mixing and the enthralling interplay among complex characters.This high budget production spares no expense, meticulously crafting each scene to transport the audience back in time with its vibrant musicality. The result is an incredibly immersive experience that makes us feel like mere witnesses to the unfolding tides of history.However, what truly sets this film apart from others is Nolan's refusal to rely on the easy allure of CGI. Instead, he harnesses the awe-inspiring potential of practical effects to bring to life epic historical events that resonated throughout humanity's journey.The ensemble cast comprised of A listers is nothing short of extraordinary, even in their limited screen time. Nolan skillfully weaves their presence into the fabric of the story, leaving an indelible mark on both the narrative and actual historical events themselves. Cillian Murphy delivers a career defining performance as the heart and soul of this film, while Robert Downey and Emily Blunt deserve well deserved Oscar nominations for their outstanding supporting roles that add another layer of brilliance to an already stellar ensemble. I really loved Emily Blunt's last interview, it was one of the standout moments in the entire movie.In the third act, the film takes an exhilarating turn, almost feeling like a sequel within itself. This segment becomes the catalyst for exploring the depths of each character, peeling back their layers and revealing the complexities of their personas. The interplays between the characters are not only captivating but also socially and politically driven, reflecting the selfish tendencies that reside within every human psyche.At the center of this captivating character study is Oppenheimer, brilliantly portrayed by Cillian Murphy. Here, Nolan expertly captures the internal struggle of Oppenheimer, torn between his unwavering desire to see his country emerge victorious in the war and the haunting realization that his work has led to the deaths of thousands of people. This internal conflict adds an extra dimension to the narrative, making the movie truly exceptional.This portrayal of Oppenheimer as a multi-faceted individual, both hero and potential villain in the course of history, sets the stage for a riveting debate among movie lovers and the public alike. Audiences will be left grappling with the moral implications of his actions and the choices he made during this critical juncture of humanity's past.The film's third act not only ties together the plot's loose ends but also provides a deep psychological exploration of the characters, making it a thought-provoking cinematic experience. It showcases Nolan's mastery in crafting characters with profound internal conflicts and motivations, sparking discussions that will resonate long after leaving the theater.In this climactic act, the story reaches its pinnacle, leaving audiences with a mix of emotions and a desire for introspection. The film transcends its historical roots, becoming a timeless meditation on the duality of human nature and the profound impact of one person's choices on the course of history. It is this rich exploration of human complexity that sets this biopic apart and makes it a cinematic triumph.Nolan's artistry transcends cinematic boundaries, transforming this biopic into a mesmerizing opus, a symphony of emotions, ideas, and reflections on the human condition. Beyond a mere chronicle of a bomb, the film probes into the intricacies of the human psyche, navigating the labyrinth of politics on both national and personal scales. It deftly embraces the themes of science, power, and the harrowing specter of world destruction. As the credits roll, we find ourselves contemplating the profound impact of this film, forever imprinted in our hearts and minds. It is a magnum opus that will resonate through the ages, cementing Nolan's status as a true cinematic visionary."
"Oppenheimer is not a typical Nolan films like Inception or Interstellar. It is a three hour long biographical thriller film which was running like a fast moving car. As an IR student i've found it very relatable but thats not the case with most of the Indian audience. This movie has lot of characters like Strauss, J Hoover, Roosevelt, Kennedy and many more American scientists. You should have fair idea about their role in American history then only you could relate it better. First half was very much setting up the plot of the film which revolves around Oppenheimer's Journey. But the second half right from the ""Trinity test"" to the mystery of the end was an absolute amazing. The background score was tense and will held you till the end of the movie. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey have given their career best performance. Eventually, all i can say it is more of ""Dunkirk"" kind of film rather than Dark Knight or Interstellar. If you love watching serious cinema then it is a must watch movie, you will surely enjoy it."
"Not a fan of the timing, i think the film was a bit long some scenes seemed unnecessary, the music and overall sound design was great though saved some scenes that were a bit long for certain, the framing of shots is a bit repetitive at times but the overall filming is as good as expected, the storytelling was great although a bit less clear near the end but it might just be an impression due to the length. Overall i think the movie was as good as expected, but might not be great if not viewed in a cinema, as it really needs good audio to help stay focused. Good not great, could be better, but still strongly recommend to see it."
"Christopher Nolan proves once again why he has become such a well renown and respected director in such a competitive industry. The hype for this movie was real and as much a product of Nolan's incredibly reputation as it was the subject matter and man the film was based on. The movie is a slow burn and harkens back to an older style of film that Nolan has become so beloved for in an era of CGI bloated blockbusters. Void of CGI and overblown set pieces Oppenheimer is akin to an older film simply because it is carried by its drama, themes, and outstanding cast performances more than it is by spectacle. The cinematography is second to none , using both visual and audio cues to tie into the films deeper themes. The one that comes to mind is the stomping that Oppenheimer hears in his head throughout the movie that grow louder and louder almost like an oncoming train , the source of the sound that tortures him for most of the movie is revealed closer to the end. He is also haunted by quick cuts and flashes of the bomb exploding and fire expanding etc etc. Before the trinity test scene even happens. The way the trinity test was presented was tasteful. Going on premiere night in a sold out theater, you could hear a pin drop in the room during that scene. The movie tackles heavy subjects as Oppenheimer wrestles with moral qualms and guilt over what he helped create. While powerful I do believe that the latter half of the movie involving a hearing for Dr. Oppenheimer with regards to his ongoing security clearance for the U. S. and it's nuclear program could have been condensed a bit. While I do believe that the tail end of the movie used it's time effectively to bring some weight to the movie after the trinity test and tie together some strong themes that become clear by the end. I do believe that these hearing scenes could come off as long winded at times. At best the latter half of this movie and thus it's run time is appreciated by those not bothered by long run times , who likely enjoy other long dramas in vein with Oppenheimer like The Godfather, Scarface, and more. Even those not normally used to sitting in the theater watching a movie for so long might find the film and the superb performances to be engaging enough to justify its runtime. At worst Oppenheimer suffers from an ending that feels drawn out and caused the pacing of the film to suffer. Some modern audiences who do not understand or appreciate much of the important historical context to this movie as well , might find themselves bored sitting through what feels like a court hearing towards the end of the movie. For those type of moviegoers , they probably came to see the spectacle of the trinity test scene, likely thinking it would be a finale of sorts. But on the contrary the trinity test scene merely serves as catalyst to move into the second half of the movie (thematically) speaking. I suppose the latter type of audience is not who Oppenheimer was intended for exactly. If you are a fan of film, if your a history buff, If you don't mind a slow burn and enjoy a good character piece with some good drama and themes, then Oppenheimer is a great movie for you. If you are someone who didn't know who Oppenheimer was before they announced this movie, if you don't care much for history , If your a casual movie goer whose looking for an action packed thrill ride or just decided to check it out to see what the hype was all about... then you might get mixed results. Best advice is to tailor your expectations accordingly. For me this movie was not perfect but it came pretty damn close. It's cinematography, themes , character studies, historical significance, actor performances, audio work, and of course Nolan's signature dedication to practical effects combine to deliver a film that weights up to the reputation of a man who for better or for worse changed the world as we know it. This movie solidified Nolan's place amongst names like Martin Scorsese, Stanley Kubrick and more... in other words the best of the best Hollywood has to offer! Nolan is one of if not the last of a dying breed of director. His contributions and dedication to his art help keep the original spirit of filmmaking alive at a time when the majority of what we see in theaters encompasses very little of what made the roots of the art form so compelling and special."
"The movie was great, the theme of stars, space, and light inside Oppenheimer's head with music in every scene at the start and through the movie was perfect, at first, young Oppenheimer was amazing, and really interesting to know at the beginning, however I would prefer to keep the story in chronological order, not jumping from young Oppenheimer to the older one, and showing suddenly scenes at different time and place, I am not a writer or director, and I know that the story is very long to reach the plot, but it will be really great if the build up was slower at first, starting from young to old, and then things get exciting, there are some scenes that can be avoided, and the questioning process took very long at the last quarter of the film, maybe instead showing the atomic bomb explosion in japan beside the experimental explosion would be awesome, and more screentime for Einstein!The movie was really great and deserves all the credit, Cillian Murphy carried the film all along with his amazing acting skills, he definitely deserves an oscar!"
Nolan did a good job in that movie the movie is so great at every thing good acting amazing cinematography. Nolan did not use cgi that is so great to be heard now days. But there is one problem I had in this movie that you cannot watch this in your phone or your laptop if you want to get the full experience you must watch this in cinema.if you love nolan you must watch this movie If you hate Nolan you must watch this movie if you love cgi you must watch this movie if you hate cgi you must watch this movie. Nolan did his best at this movie he is really deserve some clapping I think this movie is Nolan's best movie.
"Two reasons I will never watch this again:1. This is sooooo long and had so much talking! If I want a history lesson, I'd read a book!!! It can be soo boring, the first 30 minutes are USELESS to this story and movie.2. They never mentioned this:Tina Cordova is a sixth-generation New Mexican, hailing from a village of nearly 3,000 people an hour's drive downwind from the Trinity site. It's a community that has been fighting for decades to get recognition from the United States government about the Trinity test and compensation for millions of dollars-perhaps billions-in medical bills as locals have battled radiation-induced cancers for generations, stemming from the first nuclear test in New Mexico and dozens more above-ground tests in Nevada.Nolan can go f himself, and his movie!"
"The movie jumps from the past to present trying to be clever and come off like inception. Instead, it's just unnecessarily disorganized. I guess it's to makeup for the lack of material, they had written. Very loud and incoherent at points. There's art to sounds and tones and it was used ineffectively. There's really no development of the characters. In one instance, Kitty Oppenheimer, Emily blunt, is seen with booze and ignoring the house hold, and just unkept. Which applause to Emily blunt for her acting, she did a great job given the lack of material she was handed for the role. Then in the end, we are supposed to be applauding her in the final scene when she doesn't shake the other scientist's hand? Same goes for every other character.Also what about Oppenheimer poisoning his teacher and then considered a hero? What is this movie trying to say? I never got the importance of the isotopes sold to Norway. I had to watch a C-Span video to figure out the relevance.What I looked forward to with this film was for it covering how they developed and designed the nuclear bomb and the implications of it, but that was never covered. They do no justice to the science or imagery of the bomb. You do not have to see it in imax for the bomb scene. They also don't have a clear message of where they stand for on the premise of the bomb, since the last hour is convoluted on it's message with Oppenheimer trying to keep his secret clearance. I feel it was overhyped. Terrible writing/story telling, film cutting, visual effects, and sounds, but great acting."
"I was fully engaged throughout the 3 hours, in fact I wished for more. I do agree with the reviewer who wrote something about the need to follow closely, to turn your brain on. Following the story with its back and forth through at least three timelines could be confusing. I spent some time after it ended going over the sequence with my spouse and I can't wait to
watch it again at home with better captions than the ones I had from the theater's machine.In addition my head was spinning from all the credited cameos by many well known actors.The acting is so good that I feel badly for those with smaller parts who seem to be overlooked by reviewers due to the presence of Hollywood. Even Cillian can't really compete with the star power and charisma of Downey Jr. And Matt Damon. Kudos to David Krumholz, for example. I think he's great in his part.Viewers who expect to see a Nolan action movie about WW II with clear cut heroes and villains will be disappointed.Bring ear plugs to wear for some scenes."
"Oppenheimer is a 3-hour movie that, in contrast to Nolan's more recent sci-fi movies, demonstrates his mastery of the Biopic/Drama genre. The movie moves quickly while tackling significant themes and giving a thorough character analysis of our culture. It was one of the most frightening scenes in recent memory, making theatergoers uneasy and serving as a reminder of the full power of the film experience. With a remarkable cinematic achievement and a poignant reminder that cinema is still alive, Oppenheimer is a winner on all counts. I have already seen the movie once and intend to go back to the theater at least a few more times in the near future. It is highly recommended for everyone."
"This movie is a masterpiece; a cliché, but it is what it is. It is a very successful take on the life of Oppenheimer, who had an otherwise dramatic life given his complex nature and self contradictory actions. As with Nolan's other films, Oppenheimer assumes that the viewer has a certain level of history awareness and basic science, which is something I really admire.The direction is simply extraordinary, which is complimented by Nolan's trademark non-linear storytelling structure. The film has a lot of events going on at a pretty fast pace, which at some point really expresses the need to have the bomb completed in time. Add to the mix the incredible acting by the cast, particularly Cillian and RDJ. Outstanding performance by the duo; at the very least an Oscar nod for both the actors in their respective categories if not a win.The screenplay is really well written and a unique one. It is not written in the typical third person perspective. It is written in first person perspective which is really a very interesting approach. Hoyte van Hoytema's genius can be seen in the cinematography and the remarkable visuals the film portrays. The soundtrack in the entire film by Ludwig Göransson is unparalleled. The very first time I heard it gave me chills down my spine. The soundtrack captures the emotions of the scene and makes it even better.The only drawback I could see is the poor writing of the character Jean Tatlock. I feel the character should have had more screen time and the arc better portrayed. It felt like she came and gone too soon. On the other hand the portrayal of Kitty Oppenheimer was well written and likewise portrayed. The 3 hours flies by and you are left wanting for more given that not all of Oppenheimer's history is showcased. If that were the case the film would have been 4-5 hours long easily.I strongly recommend watching the film in IMAX as it is how it is intended to be watched. It is unfortunate that there are no 70mm IMAX screenings anymore in India. Digital IMAX is just as fine but I wish there were 70mm screenings at least somewhere in India. Rest assured, this is one of the greatest biopics ever and arguably the best work of Nolan yet, technicality wise at least."
"Jesus Christ, I thoroughly loved this movie from the very beginning to the last second. This movie had everything - incredible cinematography, all-around Oscar-worthy acting, amazing plot and storytelling and a heart wrenching score. This is what I call a perfect movie. I loved the way that the story was told.First the main points and other plot points were thrown at your face and you really couldn't make sense of it, at least if you weren't that well read on the subject.The second act kind of took the focus off the court hearing and the somewhat confusing plot points and focused more on the actual bomb.In the third act everything was tied together beautifully giving the audience clarity on what really just happened.The main role by Cillian Murphy was an all-time great performance and I have no doubt that he will score at least 1 Oscar.The supporting cast was stacked with starpower from different eras of film. Matt Damon was amazing as always and RDJ, after many years, finally made a comeback into making real films. Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh were also brilliant.The score in this film was so great and dramatic that at times it felt like I was having a heart-attack. It was truly beautiful and in my humble opinion easily the best work from Ludwig Göransson.These movies are rare nowadays and I recommend everybody to watch this movie in 70mm IMAX if possible10."
"If you are a person who enjoys a slow burn, biopic, character study, this one is gonna be in your top 10.Every single actor nails it. RDJ commands every scene he is in. Murphy embodies Oppenheimer's guilt and brilliance. Pugh, Blunt, Damon, fox dammit everyone is just fantastic. Nolan has crafted another masterpiece and is immediately in my top 3 Nolan movies.The films moment, the bomb drop, is perfect. The tensions, suspense and the silence followed by the epic boom is a cinema experience I will never forget. Please go and watch this movie in IMAX. I already want to go see it again for this moment alone. The audio mixing is nailed.There is just not a single bad performance. Not a single wasted scene. The pacing is fantastic and 3 hrs will never go by quicker.Just go and watch the movie. It may be one of the most important pictures of the century."
"I've heard that a big deterrent to watch this movie is it's 3 hour run time, however, I believe that those 3 hours make up one of the most important films in cinema history. Oppenheimer is a hard-to-swallow biopic on one of mankind's most important men to ever live, and every second of this film is nothing short of accurate history (from big factual sources like the book ""American Prometheus"" which in itself is the biggest inspiration for this film) combined with Christopher Nolan's remarkable story telling. This is a movie you do NOT want to miss. Also, don't forget to watch it on its intended format (70mm or IMAX)"
"This was such a thought provoking movie that had me thinking a lot about how one man's idea/concept could bring utter destruction.The human capacity is something one can not even fathom.This is a movie that requires your full attention and is also nice to watch along with max 1 person (imo).I thoroughly enjoyed the acting of Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Showed a new side to his acting skills I believe has not been able to show because he always stuck to the boundaries of his marvel endeavors.Either way, I must admit that depsite loving the storyline, acting, the history part of this movie as the plot. I personally did n see the use of the female characters because they did not add anything to the plot.I have only seen Cillian Murphy in peaky blinders, but from his performance there, I already knew this character was shaped only and specifically for him.It is definitely a movie everyone must give a try."
"This is the culmination of everything Christopher Nolan has directed. It's perfect. Everything, from the beginning to the ending. Going into this movie I expected a depressing film but it was way more depressed then I had thought. This is one of the greatest movies ever made. The score is phenomenal, the sound design is exhilarating, the set design is incredible, the performances are BEYOND AMAZING. This movie will 100% dominate in the awards season. I can guarantee that Cillian Murphy will take home best actor with Robert Downey Jr taking home the best supporting actor. This is a master class in cinema and needs to be seen on the biggest screen imaginable."
"The movie and acting is good. But its wayyy to long, gets boring multiple times. If it was 2 hrs it would have been better.This is one of the only times I have seen a movie from Nolan and actually had to see my watch many times just waiting for the movie to end.The music is good, but seriously too loud, so you can not hear the dialouge. This was especially difficult for my wife who is not a native english speaker and the subtitles were in Swedish in Sweden of course.I would like to give this movie a higher review but as mentioned, many of the scenes get so long and boring and nothing really happens.I think the audience who loves this movie is mainly from USA. For the rest of us it is interesting but mainly blah..."
"Such a disappointment. The movie is too long and dwells on the security clearance issue in a melodramatic and disjointed way. What did we know about Oppenheimer at the conclusion? He was a tortured soul. He liked women and was a genius. Did we feel compassion or sympathy for him? No. The over arty editing didn't help, neither the jarring score which punctuated scenes. The audience is left none the wiser about the 'Father of the bomb' nor his motivation or humanity. Clever word play and lingering shots of Murphy wearing the signature wide brimmed hat won't make up for the deficiencies. Such a shame."
"The film is very heavy, but a masterpiece. Personally, the experience I had with the film, I do not think it will be repeated, because it is so great, the sound, the great photography, the impressive embodiment of the actors, and the scene of the bombing that is difficult to forget. A masterpiece from Nolan's masterpieces, one of the best biographical films in history because it was presented in a distinctive way by Nolan with his special touches. Personally, I will watch the movie two or three times in the cinema. And my personal rating for the movie is 10/10. I recommend watching the movie in the cinema, specifically in the IMAX, to live the best possible cinematic experience."
"Well in the beginning with the scenes of the ""atoms"" in oppenheimer's head i was already blown away. The way Christopher Nolan made used of flash forwards in black and white were so good, you realy get into the story of him. Nolan used al lot of music but that is makes the movie so much better you really get sucked into the movie. The actors did there part realy good, they casting was perfect. Personlly i realy liked Einstein. Cillian Murphy's acting was so good the way that he express himself in to the movie and let his feelings get across to the viewers. I would recommand this movie to everybody. It is for me a 10/10 movie, one of the best or maybe the best movie i have ever seen."
"Fantastic movie. This is the best movie I have watched in a LONG time! We have always know how great Nolan is as a filmmaker but this makes him for me the best filmmaker ever. This is one of his best work yet, and you could argue that it is the best movie ever. The acting and story telling was perfect. Nolan and Murphy did a good job in portraying Dr. Oppenheimer as a character and personality. All the other actors did a fantastic job as well as their role I could see that all of the actors knew what they were doing. We could really see that It had some of the best cinematography I have ever seen and it was well put together. The movie is 3 hours long but you can barely even fell the length of the movie."
"The movie is naturally legendary

"I mean, why the hell are you even on this app to check the ratings of this movie? If you're a movie freak, you shouldn't even doubt Christopher Nolan's work here. About which he said is the whole struggle of his life. And, and look at the GODDAMN cast ffs, what else do u want?? If u have watched any of CN's movies u should know how great this movie is going to be!!!! I'm flabbergasted at guy's' audacity like f u for god's sake. And please note that this is going to be a movie that changes ur perspective and standard for the movies u watch after it. With all of that said, pardon my language. And oh I haven't watched the movie yet but i know its gonna be awesome. Thanks for tuning in. Bye."
"As expected A Nolan Masterpiece... Cillian Murphy and RDJ deserve an Oscar for this... People with a science background can relate better. Movie of the decade already...Minute details are taken care of. Like the fact that light travels way faster than sound...A Brief description of the movie:
During World War II, Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. Appoints physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer and a team of scientists spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. Their work comes to fruition on July 16, 1945, as they witness the world's first nuclear explosion, forever changing the course of history."
"This might not come as a shock when reading the headline, but it truly is one of the greatest movies I've seen since Forest Gump or Pulp fiction.I've never experienced ANYTHING. LIKE. THIS. In a very long time. Yes, three hours may seem long, but it surely wasn't a waste of time at any point in the movie, the way they filmed it, how it was written, all the actors as well as the roles they got just fit together in a great harmony and beauty.I just want to say how great full I am to have gotten the honour to see this masterpiece. It was breathtaking and a truly remarkable and astonishing experience. I believe this may not be an informative review, but I hope it came to use for someone to get the urge to go see this masterpiece of a movie and production."
This is one of the greatest films i've watched in a while. Murphy was perfect for his role and another fantastic job by Christopher Nolan. I remember watching the trailer and anticipating this movie more than anything. This movie lived up to my expectations and then some. The music was really good and kept the movie interesting and it felt like i was truly inside of Oppenheimer's mind. The ending scene was incredible and and the visuals of this movie blew me away. It is a bit loud sometimes but that's to come as expected when creating a movie about bombs. If you enjoy movies that are at a slower pace and require a lot of thought and attention then this movie is definitely for you.
"Watched a video on YouTube by veritasium about the man and the subject before going to see the movie. The video was more informative and entertaining to me than the movie. We actually go through some technical details and challenges the scientists had to go through.The movie on the other hand focused way too much about gossip and pity things that shallow people around the man and the project were saying or doing. How many affairs he had, which were numerous for a scientist, but didn't really focus on the bomb or technical challenges they had.It's like seeing a heist movie with the heist cut out. Or a sports movie without showing parts of the matches.Didn't really focus on his internal struggles before making the bomb, and very little afterwards. There were a couple of scenes with stylized visual effects, but wasn't most of what the movie focused on.Movie didn't explain or focus on why the famous Indian quote was important. It was mentioned a couple of times but It didn't focus enough on it or his thoughts the day before the test in my opinion.The movie was too busy trying to be a complete biopic, that it didn't have time to focus on the project. There is a lot of surface level references all over the place but very little substance."
"Frankly I was incredibly disappointed. Nolan at his best captures his audience with incredible cinematography, sound and, most importantly, narrative. Oppenheimer has incredible cinematography and sound, but lacks sorely in narrative. The actors did what they could, which I might say was a fantastic job, but Nolan simply couldn't keep focus on a few but compelling narratives, but instead shot off in all kinds of directions with multiple plots. It caused an incredibly exhausting and, dare I say, boring experience. Let's make something clear; a movie has to first and foremost be entertaining and then it can layer the entertainment with visuals and sounds. Oppenheimer did it the other way around, except the entertaining part never actually arrived."
"""Oppenheimer,"" the latest venture by auteur Christopher Nolan, is a cinematic tour de force that masterfully fuses historical gravitas with human drama. It delves into the paradoxical world of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist known as the 'father of the atomic bomb,' giving us a potent exploration of one man's ambition, guilt, and the cataclysmic power of science.As with all Nolan's films, ""Oppenheimer"" showcases an impeccably tight narrative that transcends linear storytelling. Every scene is intricately woven, each a revelation of character and event, slowly building an intense crescendo that is both chilling and mesmerizing. The multi-layered plot cleverly navigates the dilemmas faced by Oppenheimer, skillfully juxtaposing the scientific thrill of discovery with the devastating human consequences of his creation.The visual effects are, quite simply, breathtaking. Nolan brings to life the mid-20th century world of theoretical physics and wartime America with an awe-inspiring sense of realism. The climax, featuring the detonation of the atomic bomb, is a cinematic spectacle unlike any other, a poignant reminder of the destructive force humanity has unlocked.The ensemble cast delivers exceptional performances. The portrayal of Oppenheimer is nothing short of riveting - a man torn between his duty, curiosity, and the moral implications of his groundbreaking work. The nuances in his character are effectively and heart-wrenchingly conveyed, anchoring the audience in his complex emotional journey.Hans Zimmer's score, a character in itself, perfectly complements the atmospheric tension of the film. His haunting melodies add another layer of complexity to the scenes, mirroring Oppenheimer's own crescendoing turmoil and the world-changing events he set into motion.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a magnificent achievement. It's a film that successfully marries artistry with history, and personal introspection with global catastrophe. Nolan once again proves his ability to create intellectual, emotionally-resonant cinema that stays with viewers long after the end credits roll. This isn't just a film; it's an experience, a contemplation on the human condition, and a sobering reflection of our times."
"I guess this is Christopher Nolan's first film in this genre and Nolan,as done justice with it. It is an absolute masterpiece. All scenes, the bomb scene,the trial scene, the tests done,etc have been perfectly and the way film climaxes is marvelous.And the star cast have done their work magnificently on their end. Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss, hands down, has outshined evryone else. His dialogues literally made me think about it. And the sound effects of this movie are no joke. During the bomb scene, the sound effects were so accurate that it felt like I was there, standing there at Los Alamos and witnessing the event.So overall, the movie was a masterpiece."
"This move was a show stopper! Starting off with a complicated begging on Robert J. Oppenheimer with him being judged by a council. The movie continues with his research and it is all out in extraordinary view. Oppenheimer makes an outstanding young physicist and you can see his growth as he goes from Cambridge to Germany. This sequence was put together so well as he met new characters and spent a minute or two introducing them to the audience so they may be of importance later in the story. He begins teaching and later the bomb is found to be a possibility. This is where the complication begins as you go from his future to the future with Louis Strauss and they talk about things not seen yet. As Groves come to him with an idea of the directing of the bomb his past begins to unveil with communism in every corner. It is in this phase when the movie gets extremely complicated. He begins collecting scientist and Los Almos is soon made. The complication begins to unveil just as in every Christopher Nolan movie. Oppenheimer's clearance is questioned and you see Strauss at his own council meeting. He begins making the bomb and it is here where Christopher Nolan builds tension to make the movie so much better. The tension between the scientist as he builds the bomb is outstanding and makes the movie so much more realistic. You can understand how important this is and how vital it is to get everything correct.the movie takes a very political turn here with Japan about to be attacked and the tension grows when they find the bomb could destroy the world. Finally, they are put to the test and the bomb is exploded. Here is when the movie starts unraveling just as all Christopher Nolan movies. You find Strauss is the master mine between the clearance problems and you understand the council meetings with both Robert and Strauss. The moment you understand the whole movie makes sense. In the end it is heartfelt with his past and get a moral dilemma combined with politics, and physics. I love how it is all complicated and emotional yet it all makes sense in the end."
"What a splendid movie the whole 3 hours i watched it never felt like going out of the theatre the atmosphere created by the movie was so majestic..Loved cillians acting n RDJs, and ofcourse Christopher nolan the brilliant director behind all this .. The way the movie portrayed Oppenheimers character is just wonderful the making of atomic bomb the consequences he imagined after wards and the fear of having bloods in his hands the corrupt system of being jealous of another's work and forcing to work into it more false accusations on Oppenheimer by lewis strauus..you won't regret watching this movie."
"""Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"". This quote literally runs the movie theme throughout. Everyone knows what happened during WWII and how the atomic bomb led to the death and destruction of thousands of lives. But not many know how it began and what were the political toxicity that led through during and after the final event.Christopher Nolan and team does it YET AGAIN!! Nothing to say other ultra splendid movie making gripping the very core of audience taking us through not just the journey of creation of the Atomic bomb but the unparalleled roller coaster of emotions that went through to its making and the final abomination. Special mention to the sound mixing and effects team for voicing those marvellous visuals that Nolan never ceases to surprise.Overall this movie shows us how things went into the backend part of the Manhattan Project and how politics and decision making were hand in hand that led to giving the ultimate power to mankind. The power of God i.e the power of Death.Movie:10/10
Acting: 10/10
Sound & Music: 10/10
Duration: 8/10 (Yep the movie is wayy too long but i guess it makes sense)
Visuals: 10/10Overall: A big TEN!!! Nothing but a MASTERPIECE!!"
"I would give the movie an 8.5 if I could, but I'm rounding it up to a 9.When I walked out of the theater I was still kind of watching the movie in my head, processing what happened between all the politics, personal aspects of Oppy's life and the actual timeline of events. It took a bit before it all clicked, but when it did, it really dawned on me how brilliantly constructed this movie is.And any movie that makes me think about it afterwards solidifies itself as a great film.I loved the political aspect of it, though this seems to be a point of contention for a lot of people who watched it. To be fair, it's understandable, I'll admit I didn't go into the cinema expecting politics, I wanted science and numbers and explosions, and I bet most people came for the numbers and the science and the explosions; it most certainly delivered on that part.But the politics really serves to cement the movie as a part of history. It's messy, it's confusing, all over the place, and that's perfect. Yes, the messiness is a good thing, because politics isn't straight and narrow, politics is confusing! Good job to the writers and directors.Jean Tatlock is a character that I wish we could have seen more of - though many aspects of her story aren't really relevant to that of Oppenheimer, the movie did encourage me to read up about her and realize just how tragic her story is. She really deserves her own movie at some point.Good movie. Good plot, good pacing, it made me think a lot, and that is good."
"Excellent direction and acting . You never get to see Cilian Murphy, you only see J Robert Oppenheimer. The rest of the cast was fantastic as well, special mention to Robert Downey Jr. Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt all give an excellent performance. Ludwid Gorranson's score sends chill throughout the body. My only issue was with the sound mixing. In certain parts the score gets a bit too loud that it's a bit difficult to listen to the dialogue between the actors, but it won't be an issue if subtitles are shown. Overall outstanding movie and expect at least 3-4 Academy award nominations. 9.6/10."
The movie had Christopher Nolan and was a banger. Especially it's rated r and 3 hours long. It also has such a great beginning and ending. I liked the part when they dodge the missile in the end and how the movie was orchestrated and it turned out absolutely amazing. The trailer was hyping it uncontrollably and had more than a 100 great scenes. I love it's realitism and when he said we're in a fight against the nazis I was so uncontrollable that I decided I would watch the movie millions of times just so I could hear that part. In particular the beginning was so good I was crying 😢 😭 😫. So this is my review on the banger oppenheimer.
"Christopher Nolan is an ambitious director who is always trying to impact and surprise. He is able to do it sometimes BUT NOT ALWAYS. TENET his previous movie was too difficult to follow for many people and not that satisfying at the end.OPENHAIMER is basically the same. The first hour or so is about a very particular (far from humble, almost mad) person who suddenly become incredible recognized to the point of being the chief of the Manhattan Project. Cillian Murphy is excellent but is never clear how a semi communist, semi womanizer suddenly became so recognized.Then another hour is about the project itself and discussions with a fellow scientists until the the bomb is made; even without much knowledge is basically the most appealing part; but his wife crisis (she is an alcoholic who despises his children) shown and strangely resolved. Also; how a person the created such thing could become so pacifists and worried about humanity.It is something logic but the movie changes the characters without any kind of progression or moral dilema.The third part of the movie; a very complicated political situation were Truman (play by Gary Oldman who also did Churchill) is depicted not as a nice or grateful person and lots of other politicians are shown even works (outstanding Robert Downey Jr. Who started a naïve person to become the worst of all enemies); but is resolved by Rami Malek (in his only real scene ) in from of the Congress.Suddenly Oppenheimer about to be CRUCIFIED and the next scene shows him receiving a medal from the PresidentThe point is the movie three hours long has big continuity issues. Most of us know, history and understand what happened but will young people really be clear ?In brief; is not bad but is unnecessary long in empty parts and to too short in many important aspects."
Glorifying life and acts of a person responsible for millions of innocent deaths including babies and children is abomination.Horrendous aftermath of this catastrophe has been conveniently omitted from the movie. Why? Why are you afraid to show the consequences of your unforgivable actions? Because then you will no longer be able to sell it off as intellect and brilliance. People will be disgusted by what your so called brilliance produced.And healing your guilt by citing bhagvad Gita?I guess they never bothered to dive into teachings of Gita else they wouldn't have used it so loosely to justify a type of act it actually condemns.West has always marketed it's blood ridden past as being intellectual and extraordinary. It's sickening.
"Personally, i think Christopher Nolan is the best director of all time. You have a different experience in each of his movies. The cast is great and this movie was one of my first times seeing Cillian Murphy and he was spectacular to say the least. It felt like every expression had a meaning. His performance will be talked a lot over the years. RDJ stole the show every scene he was in and i wish he got more screen time. Although the movie was dialogue driven every dialogue and every scene was like an action scene courtesy of Nolan. And the music REALLY helped this film given most of the movie was based on dialogues. I'm gonna watch the movie for the second time tomorrow because i couldn't get all the information and couldn't completely understand the film although it was pretty straightforward. There were a lot of stuff to unpack in the movie. I liked it very much and i highly suggest you watch this movie."
"In an age where cinema is dying thanks to multiple releases of consumable products that taste/feel the same this was the movie I personally needed and the entire movie Industry needed as well. All actors did a phenomenal job, Cillian Murphy was simply fantastic, Robert Downy Jr. Was so versatile and the entire supporting cast delivered their best and it was impactful. The long 3 hour runtime didn't feel long at all in fact it had me hooked from the start till the end, there was no scene that was boring or dragged out. Christopher Nolan proving once again that he is one of the best in this age, this may be his best work yet.This movie deserves all the praise that it's getting."
"A truly remarkable film that, as the poster boasts, will change the world forever.In our modern political environment fraught with corruption on both sides - while the world teeters towards another global war and the threat of nuclear deployment - I can think of no film more informational and more critical for the American public to watch in this moment, than Oppenheimer.Nolan delivers a phenomenal film - jam packing a truly foundational moment of American history into a remarkable 3 hour journey.Arguably dividing the film into two acts, Nolan provides a rare glimpse into the astonishing reality of how America battled through the nuclear program in World War II. Immaculately providing an amalgamation of physics, patriotism, and philosophy Nolan takes a rather scientific effort and transforms it into the astonishing moment of history that it was.Through the use of bewildering special effects, a star studded cast, and an inspiring score Nolan is able to build to the boom in such a way that keeps the audience wholly engaged and entertained - while Cillian Murphy delivers a performance of a lifetime bringing the emotion, education, and eccentricity of Dr. Oppenheimer to life in a character that will permanently be tied to Murphy.And yet, the true darkness of the film does not occur until the second act - after the detonation of the bomb. Focusing on the witch-hunt efforts of the jaded Lewis Strauss, Nolan's Act 2 skewers the underbelly of a darker and corrupter time in American politics. Nolan - with stunning accuracy and gripping reality retells the story of how American agencies - particularly our FBI - was weaponized against Dr. Oppenheimer so as to discredit and disengage him from the American public.But after the second half, I found myself pondering ""How much of this has really changed? Have our agencies? Our leaders? Our FBI?"" And when I reflect on where our politics and country stand today, I found myself thinking - no.This is perhaps the most stunning piece of Nolan's puzzle. That he is able to so artfully display American greatness and innovation against corruption and cruelty - without losing a beat.Much like a nuclear explosion, Oppenheimer blows the viewer away with this amazing storytelling - ignited by a perfected cast and cinematography - but also just as a nuke once it has gone off, it leaves those in its wake in a moment of silence."
"This is the best movie I've seen in a very long time. On my all-time movie list it's a close 2nd with Interstellar at number 1.The movie depicts the life of Oppenheimer very nicely and showed how he rose from student to the father of the atomic bomb. Living in a golden age of physics and science in general, the movie shows how Oppenheimer was one of the top guys of all-time.From start to finish I felt the suspense/excitement in my body as it was just another masterpiece from Christopher Nolan. Oppenheimer depicted a very well-balanced story about his personal life as well as about his professional life. The three hours long picture was over before I knew it.In conlusion, the movie is awesome and definitely a recommendation to fans of Nolan's work and fans of great cinema."
"""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic masterpiece that captivates audiences with its impressive direction, profound storyline, and outstanding performances. Depicting the fascinating life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, one of the most significant physicists of the 20th century, the film is both informative and emotionally moving. The filmmakers skillfully portray the complexity of his character and the moral dilemmas he faced. The visual effects and set design transport viewers to another era, creating an authentic atmosphere. ""Oppenheimer"" is an absolute masterpiece and a must-watch for film and history enthusiasts alike."
"One of the greatest movie I have witnessed. The movies score, cinematography, acting were all brilliant, especially the trinity test, the silence was almost deafening creating a great experience for the viewer. Will most certainly recommend watching the movie in imax as it gives the most immersive experience. Only downside of the movie is the audio quality, as for particular scenes almost nothing was understandable especially science with Lewis Strauss and the scene where Oppenheimer learns tatlock has committed sucide. The movie is highly dialogue based so a heads upon that as it may be irritable for some. The ending makes u feel a way as if you have helped him commit this crime . Overall one of the greatest movies directed by Christopher Nolan and it deserves the Oscar's for numerous acts."
"Oppenheimer is a biographical drama film about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientist who led the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb. The film explores Oppenheimer's moral dilemma as he grapples with the implications of his work and the potential for nuclear destruction.Review: Oppenheimer is a visually stunning and thought-provoking film that offers a complex and nuanced portrait of one of the most important figures in the history of science. Cillian Murphy gives a tour-de-force performance as Oppenheimer, bringing to life the scientist's brilliance, charisma, and inner turmoil. The supporting cast is also excellent, with Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Rami Malek, and Kenneth Branagh all giving memorable performances.The film's direction by Christopher Nolan is masterful. Nolan uses his trademark visual style to create a film that is both visually arresting and emotionally resonant. The film's use of sound and music is also effective, helping to create a sense of tension and dread.Oppenheimer is not without its flaws. The film is long, and some viewers may find the pacing to be slow. Additionally, the film's depiction of the Bhagavad Gita has been met with criticism from some viewers.( In possitive ony one cannot miss the Bhagawat Gita and in negative way it's the inappropriate time to discuss on it it's would be better if presenting as per Karthik 2 when anupam kher explain about shree Krishna)
Overall, Oppenheimer is a powerful and important film that offers a unique and thought-provoking perspective on one of the most important events in human history. The film is beautifully made, and Cillian Murphy gives a tour-de-force performance. However, the film's length and the depiction of the Bhagavad Gita may be off-putting to some viewers.Recommendation: I would recommend Oppenheimer to viewers who are interested in science, history, or war films. The film is also a good choice for viewers who are looking for a thought-provoking and challenging film."
"You can draw modern-day parallels with Artificial Intelligence and (the inaction of) Climate Change that threatens humanity. More specifically, nations that still see it opportune to rely on fossil fuels and coal as they grow their economy as time to prevent our planet being uninhabitable is running out. Oppenheimer is brilliant with its fantastic visuals, immersive score, and pulsating dialogue.I've found myself hanging onto every word of a three hour movie, due to the urgency that Christopher Nolan cultivates throughout the film. By the time you put the pieces together of what is going on, you find yourself in the same bind that J Robert Oppenheimer is in. The way the film escalates and finishes with a weighty parting scene will leave you to contemplate the trajectory of humanity, and whether or not we can stop a seemingly insurmountable problem. 10/10."
"The acting in this film is fascinating and the cast is absolutely stellar. It's an interesting story and certainly would have deserved a 9 were it not for two major flaws that are common in movies these days but taken to absurd excess here. First, the sound. It was so muffled and echoey, and the music and sound effects were so overwhelming, that my friends and I missed at least a third of the dialog. Since the drama depended on the dialog, this was a serious error in judgment. At times, it was obvious something very humorous was occurring in the dialog, but the entire audience just sat in confused silence trying to figure out what was going on. And then there were the frequent changes in scene. Just as you are settling into a scene, suddenly the story jumps to a different city, with different people, in a different decade. Between the inaudible dialog and the frenetic changes in scene, the film was often difficult to follow. I look forward to watching this with subtitles to see what I missed."
"Spoilers ahead, please don't watch this, I know that I'm not a fan of Christopher Nolan's films. Christopher Nolan's film 'Oppenheimer' is so controversial right now, and it's in huge trouble. Oppenheimer is some of it was creatively weaved in, but the majority felt very pace-breaking and unnatural. The main hooks in the movie, Ludwig and the editing team made some amazing sequences, but for the most part, it's largely quite boring. It is profound to harness the strong force, and make a film about it - but there is a subtle self-importance to the film. It's the feeling of an artist knowing they create profound art, and the self awareness seeps into the art and you can feel it. It's hard to explain, but it's tangible in this film. They boycott it and it's because of allegedly featuring a scene of a book called 'Bhagavad Gita' right after having their sex. It's a very disrespectful scene."
"This movie is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece that deserves every bit of praise it receives. From the moment the film begins, you are immediately drawn into a mesmerizing world, skillfully crafted by the brilliant mind of Christopher Nolan.Cillian Murphy's performance as Oppenheimer is nothing less than awe-inspiring. He flawlessly embodies the complex character, conveying a depth of emotions that keep you fully engaged throughout the entire film. It's a portrayal that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll.The direction and cinematography are equally exceptional. The film's visuals are breathtaking, and when experienced in the immersive setting of an IMAX theater, it becomes a truly unforgettable experience. The grandeur of the scenes, combined with the stellar sound design, envelopes you in a way that few movies can.But it's not just the technical aspects that make this movie shine. The storytelling is masterful, carefully weaving historical events with personal struggles, creating a powerful narrative that explores the moral complexities of Oppenheimer's life and work. The script allows for profound moments of reflection, leaving you pondering the implications of the story long after the lights come up.Furthermore, the supporting cast's performances are outstanding, adding layers of depth to the overall narrative. Each character feels fully realized, bringing their own unique perspectives to the unfolding events.In a time where blockbuster franchises often dominate the big screen, this movie is a breath of fresh air, reminding us of the true artistry that can be achieved in cinema. It's a testament to the power of storytelling and the impact that a well-crafted film can have on its audience.In conclusion, this movie is an absolute must-see for anyone who appreciates exceptional filmmaking. It's a symphony of visual and emotional artistry, driven by an extraordinary performance from Cillian Murphy. Watching it in IMAX elevates the experience to another level, making it a true feast for the senses. Don't miss the opportunity to witness this cinematic gem that will leave an indelible mark on your soul."
"Chris Nolan never stops surprising me with his movies, this is a masterpiece and his first movie ever made based on a true story, with an amazing cast, production, photography and acting, everyone here did an awesome acting.Interstellar became my favorite movie not just from Nolan's but among every other directors but Oppenheimer for some reason made me feel like I wasn't even watching a movie but actually like if I was watching the story in real life as if I was IN THE MOVIE, it really sucked me in, and just like said in an interview, don't try to understand my movies, just feel them, and indeed I sure felt it."
"I got out asking myself if the movie was not too long. But thinking it twice, the narrative frame is so good that the 2h45 seemed not so long and the global story was not annoying or boring...of course Nolan could have cut 30 minutes to make it more mainstream but the film editing is great. A contemplative experience as usual with Nolan but Cylian Murphy is so good and Robert Downey is a credible Lewis Strauss. I would not view it again on TV but I would pay for 70mm version in theater. The pre requisite of non using special effects can be disturbing as we are waiting for that bomb to explode for 2 hours but the outcome can be disappointing for some people. All in all, a great balance between Nolan genius and a lovely biopic."
"Oppenheimer (2023)""And now I am become death, destroyer of worlds""Mark my words when I say Oppenheimer is cleaning house at the next Academy Awards. This is (in my opinion) without doubt Christopher Nolan's best ever work of cinema and perhaps the best movie I've seen in the last decade. Hell, I'd go as far as saying it's now in my top 3 greatest movies of all time.I dare you to watch this, consider all the tenets that make up a great movie (Compelling Story, Character Development, Talented Cast, Direction, Cinematography, Editing, Music and Sound, Production Design, Screenplay, Emotional Resonance, Themes and Messages, Originality and Innovation) and identity a single point where this movie doesn't deliver.Every single cast member (both main and supporting cast) brings their A-game to the screen. Robert Downey Jr, Cillian Murphy, and perhaps Emily Blunt have a date with the Oscars.I can't hype this movie enough but Oppenheimer is A MUST SEE. A true cinematic masterpiece that deserves every single praise it gets.Rating: 10/10."
"This movie is incredible, its emotional, epic and interesting, I left the theater feeling like id been punched in the gut, I genuinely cried after watching this, truly one of the best movies of the generation.Robert Oppenheimer's story is arguably the most important in moden history, as he is the man that gave humanity the power to destroy itself, so if your a fan of history then I abulousty cannot recommend this move enough.The visuals are spectacular, the acting is incredible, the story is thrilling. The cast is extremally impressive, including many femes acters and actress'. All an all I cannot recommend this movie enough, ablerlote must see."
Perfectly fine with me and I hope that it will be a good one for me some time they will be a written one of them has different purpose and shows different view of the map and the workplace and the workplace to the games and this addiction slowly interrupts the personality of this human being and the workplace and the workplace to the games and this addiction slowly interrupts the personality of this human being and the workplace and the workplace to the games and this addiction slowly interrupts the personality of this human being and the workplace and the workplace to the games and this addiction.
"I went to watch 2AM SHOW IN IMAX , PAKISTAN AND IT WAS HOUSEFUL/COMPLETE SOLD OUT.People are crazy about NOLAN'S WORK.I DON'T KNOW ABOUT REST OF THE WORLD GUYS ,BUT ASIA IS CRAZY ABOUT CHRISTOPHER NOLAN AND HIS WORK.MARVELLOUS!Great acting, cinematography & everything about this movie is love!Nolan's movies are always great. Cillian is awesome and maybe that's the reason he has been part of the most of Nolan's movies.It's 3 hours long movie and even thinking about it will make you believe that it's boring? But it's Christopher Nolan's universe, you'll not get bored even for a second because of story, effects, sound etc. Proper engagement!Phenomenal.It's 3."
Its the beat movie that i have watched in a while the acting the cast wow people who understand movies will know how good this movie was done cilan the actor whi played oppeenhaimer deserves oscar for his roll Hi's acting was priceless just beautiful You fell like your experiencening the movie with the actors in ever way and shows you how the bomb really changed the word einsten was a beautiful touch to the movie also i hope people understand how a good of a jop they did in this movie and understand how nolan and cilan give it there all in this movies they definitely deserve unaward for this movie..
"Making quality historical biopics is hard. First, a director wants to be true to history. Second, a director wants to entertain a broad audience. So here, master director Chris Nolan took on the task of a biopic of Robert Oppenheimer - the ""father of the atomic bomb"". I am sure the movie will get an oscar nod or two. But for this reviewer, it fell short of that lofty mark. First major flaw was the length of the film. It ran THREE HOURS. Yikes. I would almost go so far as to say no movie should run that long. That may go too far, but as to this particular film, the key part of the Oppenheimer life story should have taken 2 hours. Second major flaw, at least in IMAX, was a loud ""boomy"" audio that made dialogue tough to follow. ""Boomy"" bass is fine for atomic test explosions and the like, but not for dialogue. With that said, the quality of acting by Cilian Murphy, Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and others was natural and convincing. I won't fault them."
"This movie was overhyped to the death starting months before the screening. It was hailed as the film who is going to save Hollywood, and humanity.Ultimately, it was an extremely long and boring movie.It had a lame 10 minutes explosion scene which doesn't resemble any kind of nuclear explosion, and to think that Christopher Nolan has claimed that there are no special effects in this film and everybody was giggling to see a real nuclear explosion.Robert Downey Jr's character has taken the whole movie as a hostage and could have been removed completely. As a matter of fact this movie could be an hour less without having any effect on the story.As for the story, there are so much subplots (including one with numerous full frontal nudity!!) and the things are dragged so long, you will not remember anything substantial when you leave the theatre.The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it was great to see Gary Oldman as US President.But all in all, I feel so stupid for falling for this hype. Let this be a lessen for the next time."
"I attended Friday afternoon matinee on opening day. I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the crowd. I took notice this movie was mostly sold out for all showings. It encouraged me to see people seeking out intelligent ""entertainment. ""This is a very accurate portrayal of Mr. Oppenheimer. A well scripted an researched historical account of his personal and professional life. It's a long movie, but the intricacies of the story require the time to develop. I personally appreciated the moral and social issues and conflicts that were addressed as they related to the political climate and his own personal life."
The best film ever written. The acting was just out of the world . The writers were just amazing. I came out of the cinema just speechless. I cant put words to this movie. That's how good it was. The effects it amazing. Best Christopher Nolan movie ever. This movie deserves so may oscars. Cillian Murphy was absolutely brilliant. He deserves Oscar . And it had some great cast in it. Go watch it now . It's so unbelievable good . I never sat still though out a movie . But this film made me sat down and still for 3hrs. I have never see a film more speechless then ever before. This an a masterpiece from the beginning to the end.
"Nolan focuses on particular stage in the life of Oppenheimer, were he led the team of scientist to creating, what would be later, regarded, the Destroyer of all worlds.With zero CGI, Nolan manages to create stunning visual effects and achieve almost-impossible challenges of recreating the Trinity bomb effects. The IMAX created a sense of emotional attachment with the main characters, by portraying true form emotions and effects, and that itself was a pure masterpiece of cinematography.The music, composed by Ludwig Goransson, was divided into two themes, one that is character-related and the other that is event-related, and it was immersive at every point of time due to the intensity and delicacy of those events.Nolan, a timeless director of the century, wanted this to be the movie of the century, and there is a very good reason why. Because, it is the reason we are living the way we are now, in this so called ""World Order"", the event that changed the course of history forever and defined our present and future geopolitical world for generations to come.That is why, Nolan took a bold decision in staying away from the story-like, interstellar-like, inception-like, narrative, and focused more on the politics, moral-rich dialogues, and character-rich involvement that diversified between the inner and outer circle of J. Robert Oppenheimer.In his masterpiece, Christopher Nolan, highlights the controversial character of Oppenheimer, who we saw from the beginning, mentally driven to develop and create the atom bomb that will help strengthen his theories.We see how imperialist-acting USA treats its scientists who defies their foreign policy, by demarginalizing them, defaming them and discrediting them. One scene really hits the core when Oppy is trying to convince his lab colleague to join him and say ""They need us"" who in return replies ""Until they don't"", and that is reflected specifically after Oppenheimer finished the trinity test, and starts feeling left out of major details of how things will go from there.The movie gives justice to portraying a murderous unapologetic apartheidic TRUMAN criminal, who sets the historical narrative of USA for generations to come ""USA will always bomb hundreds of thousands of people, and collateral damages, to preserve world order and peace amongst the rest"", this is the holy grail of the devil himself.The relationship between Strauss and Oppenheimer, is probably the most controversial and defining moments in the lives of both characters. Strauss sees a side of J. Robert Oppenheimer, that is true in many ways. The man knew what he was up to, and it wasn't a lab homework, he was building a bomb to be used, just like gunpowder (also referenced by Oppenheimer during his meeting with General Groves), which means that he believes in the pattern of events following a creation of , what could be, a deadly weapon. It is a point view to see Oppenheimer as a hypocrite, and it is actually a strong one. Despite being fought and framed by the AEC and the FBI and Strauss, it is still a valid point. Both are two sides of the same coin. DESTROYERS OF WORLDS.Oppenheimer might be finally Nolan's long awaited and anticipated Oscar win for best director and Cillian's performance is also to be topped at the Golden Awards.The movie of the Century indeed."
"This movie was incredible. Extremely gripping right from the jump. You're immediately thrown into the life of J Robert Oppenheimer and his complex life and mind. The movie doesn't hold back when it comes to pace. All scenes and dialogue feel like they are shot out of a cannon, but it just further accentuates how jam-packed this movie is with information and flare. The 3 hour run-time was no issue even for somebody such as myself who tends to get bored when moves push longer than 2.5 hours. The movie almost feels like it's more around the 2 to 2 1/2 hour run-time due to how entrenched you become in the story and the overall characters. The movie can be very jarring with how technical some of the dialogue and nuanced discussions between scientists can be. Nolan doesn't try and dumb down the movie for the audience and really respects the intelligence of the viewer. A second viewing almost feels necessary to discern every character and minutiae the movie has to offer, but I wont be waiting long to indulge in that second viewing. Please go see this movie, even if you already have an idea of how some of the actual historical events took place. It's well worth your time and well."
"Definitely being my favorite 3 hours this year, this film brings you an unexpected visual feast. You cannot miss a second, enormous details are easily missed away. This film didn't only show the creation of the nuclear bomb, it literally shows the life and tragedy of Robert Oppenheimer, how he encounters risking DESTROYING THE WORLD enable to save it.The acting of the cast is way above expectations, like Murphy, how he grabbed our heart and eyes into this film. Stating not to watch it, but to feel through the theme and parts of the story, Oppenheimer is a great example, starring good cast with good actings."
"Christopher Nolan's latest film, Oppenheimer, is an absolute triumph of storytelling and visual artistry. The IMAX experience elevated the already mesmerizing narrative to a whole new level! 🌌Cillian Murphy's portrayal of the lead character is nothing short of astonishing. He embodies the role with such depth and nuance that an Oscar nod seems inevitable! 🏆The film's thought-provoking themes and powerful messages left me wishing I could assemble all the world leaders in one giant IMAX theater to share this experience together. #FoodForThought #NolanMagicIf you haven't seen Oppenheimer yet, you're missing out on a true cinematic gem. Prepare to be spellbound and awestruck!"
"Have no words.its just incredible.the ending just scary and beautiful at the same time. I have nothing to to say it's just incredible much incredible.During World War II, Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. Appoints physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer and a team of scientists spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. Their work comes to fruition on July 16, 1945, as they witness the world's first nuclear explosion, forever changing the course of history.This is exactly the Christopher Nolan relieved the history.The famous speech of openheimer ""IAM become death the destroyer of worlds"". Is in this film as well."
"I have never written a review on this site, nor had I planned to until I sat down and watched Oppenheimer. I was floored by its effortless genius and masterful writing. The movie takes the viewer on a turbulent, frankly disturbing ride, that leaves you jostled, depressed, and stunned. A cinematic experience that goes unmatched. A cinematic experience that I hope is not overlooked by the often ignorant Oscars. The film easily cements itself as Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus. The directors usual tricks that often make his films at times fall flat, work wonders here. From the entirely practical effects to dialogue overload that in his other films feel hollow only fuel the fire that is Oppenheimer. Techniques that make me overjoyed that Nolan was the director to make this movie and not someone else. If you have not seen it, I urge you. Yes, it is long, and yes, it is not an action filled blockbuster, but it is something better. A movie that tells a story that changes the way the viewer perceives the world we live in. Because isn't that what art is supposed to do."
"There's just too much stuff going on. I would have preferred lesser information, lesser number of characters and lesser timeline switching.And what I would have wanted more was... more time with (lesser number of) characters... their backstories, their motivations.Overall, I didn't FEEL much in the movie. I didn't feel the dilemmas, the dangers, the urgencies, the betrayals with those characters. I wasn't rooting for anyone, I wasn't really against anyone.I actually did enjoy the bomb explosion, not because it was like the best visual ever, in fact it was not... I enjoyed it because I just new it was a real explosion. That made it interesting. Never really looked at a real life explosion with such details before. So, thanks for that. :)All in all I'm still glad I watched the movie. But I wish I had gone to see the movie after reading some bad reviews. My high expectations probably made the whole thing a bit more disappointing."
"What I have against this movie :
in the beginning you as a spectator are just abandoned in the middle of a story without any introduction or exposition, like you're expected to do your homework at home and just after go to see the moviefor a good majority of time the movie is dragging, in some points is has pointless dialogue and dramatoo many characters and names you don't know nothing about and are too hard to keep countingthe sex scene was awkward and the nudity seemed really unnecessaryit seemed like the movie followed to many narrative threads for the majority of time and then struggled to connect them in the last half an hour - thus connecting the loose ends seemed forced at times and since there was little to no character development or study to the majority of the characters, at times they acted, guess what, ""out of character"". For real, there were like a hundred characters introduced to us only for them to appear for like 1 and a half minutes."
"Cilian has to get an Oscar for this one...
Long time due recognition... Man is just brilliant...
What can we say about Nolan, exceptional..
Only taking 1 star away because of the sound / audio was tough to follow in certain phses during the film.Otherwise, a magnus thearitical experience that you don't want to miss out on..Only second to Murphy comes Robert Downy J... Never seen any of his movies before but man can thr guy act... Obviously I knew him as Iron Man but the bundle of talent he possesses has been captured by Nolan perfectly by his camera..Matt Demon and Emily were also brilliant ..Sound design could have been better though.. If you can watch it on a screen with subtitles..."
"It was good movie. But It wasn't like one of the masterpiece. It wasn't very good cinematically, but it was good for a biopic. And it is my first Nolan ' s movie. I watched for Openheimer.i knew him before the movie announcement. I watched documentary about him .And not gonna lie I didn't know Nolan's name before the movie announcement. Anyways movie portrayed political things good but philosophically something was missing. Like most iconic quote in movies was used in the sex scene. Yes they used after the bomb but the philosophical value of that quote is simplified with that sex scene. Also They didn't use the words he used before saying this famous quote. ""We knew the world will not be the same Few people laughed,few people cried,most people were silent..."" I was expecting those words in the movie. Honestly I was disappointed. But overall good movie."
"Tedious at times but it needed to be said this way or risk leaving out what transpired when they started the project and what transpired after WWII was over. Strauss was a villain, and Oppenheimer a genius for the science and the application of the science. He wove his skills he honed in his life for being the nerds nerd. He was their hero and another powerful man's ambitions was something that he hadn't prepared for or didn't see.The subplot of the committee that was set up to decide whether Oppenheimer could keep his security clearance could have benefited from a shortened number of scenes.So I loved the story but the big sound from the imax theater had me jumping out of my seat during the test on July 16th."
Cillian Murphy has now had his greatest performance of his career if he does not win best actor at the Oscar's something is very wrong in my opinion. And this movie is going to be hard to beet for me as the movie of the year. The story was very good I did not even feel that 3 hour run time at all. No spoilers but the parallel from world War 3 politics to today's political climate is astounding the sound mix of the movie was great the direction of the movie was Oscar worthy Robert Downey Jr. Was fantastic his best performance of his career as well the score of the movie was great this is very intense in places over all I loved it.
"This movie is just the right amount of everything. Great pacing, great turning point for the story and complete ending to the movie. Though I do feel the explosion in the movie could have felt more alive. Also there were only 3 explosions in the entire movie, which was a massive let down. Aside from that minor issue, the movie portrayed the whole story of Oppenheimer. Cinematography was on point and the acting from every cast member was through the roof. Favorite part was when they ended the movie with revealing the secret conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein. I feel it made a strong conclusion because Oppenheimer expressed his true feeling about the atomic bomb."
"First time writing a paragraph about a movie. Christopher Nolan created the master of the masterpieces he had created ever. The movie was something I have never seen. The cinematography was too perfect and the score and the music+Themes+songs+sound grading was unexplainably good.If we talk about the movie, Nolan said that this movie is a horror movie. It is actually a horror movie. When the bomb exploded, some mf's clapped but The ones who understood the movie, was in a shock state. Dead silent. I personally had a lil heart attack. It's that scary and blissful at the same time. The hope and the hopelessness mixed feeling was legit something I have never felt. I don't wanna spoil the movie. But if you can, please go to a theater and watch this. A masterpiece should be experienced how it's supposed to be experienced.The movie is depressing. I personally felt like I was depressed yet all the hope in the world gathered upon my palm for a moment, Unstoppable. This is not just a movie. This is something else. Now I can finally say, this is the greatest movie of all time. Fk shawshank redemption. (Don't fk it, I love shawshank redemption)
G. M. O. A. T. Imo."
"This movie is truly magnificent. All of Nolan's decisions are somewhat changing the rules of cinema and going around them. The acting is brilliant from all sides. Murphy is one of the best actors and will be truly appreciated after this role. Also, I truly love the fact that there is no CGI in this movie. It makes every explosion or metaphor for Oppenheimer's thoughts even more strong than if they were computer generated. Also the montage of the film is truly marvelous and innovative. The film is constructed in such way that it catches the audience's attention and it doesn't let go. For sure, this is one for the future generations!"
"First of all, I must say that I personally loved the movie. It was very well made and historically accurate. But I also have to point out that I'm a history nerd and I have read everything about the history of physics and the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear energy because these things fascinate me. If you're not like me, I bet this movie might feel boring.What this movie doesn't have is emotional investment like previous Nolan masterpieces such as Inception and Interstellar. Oppenheimer's love life and trust with Jean Tatlock serves little purpose for the plot compared to Cobb's love story in Inception and Cooper's feelings for his children in Interstellar. In this regard, it feels like Nolan has already made his best and most complete movies and may never reach that same level again.I also understand the criticism conerning the score. While not bad, the score here is nowhere near as good as Hans Zimmer's scores for The Dark Knight, Inception and Interstellar. As with the emotional investment, this, too, is a thing that may never reach the same level of greatness as previous Nolan pieces.The reason why I'm saying that Nolan might never reach the same level again is that these are also the things that were lacking in his previous movie Tenet. Oppenheimer was definitely better than Tenet, and I like both movies, but honestly both lack emotional investment and a memorable score. There was also at least one scene in Oppenheimer with jump dialogue, which was a thing I hated in Tenet.Lastly, I have to point out that even though I love the history of physics and nuclear weapons, they also had a too small role in the movie. Sure, there were many theories and names thrown around, but I bet the uninformed viewer will miss at least half of them. If you compare this movie to the TV series Chernobyl, things are not explained nearly as well. This movie also lacks the excitement and thriller aspect of similar productions such as Chernobyl (about nuclear physics) and The Imitation Game (about a secret World War 2 facility).So, all in all we're left with a historical movie, most of which deals with politics. I still liked it, but I'm not surprised if many people find it a tad boring. At the same time as I was enjoying watching the movie, I was afraid that my date was bored because she doesn't like history, politics or nuclear physics."
"Oppenheimer takes on a very difficult job, to accurately illustrate a complex man who must reconcile his love for theoretical physics and scientific discovery with his fear of being the American Prometheus, capable of giving the country he loves the power to destroy itself.Nolan takes a cubist approach to formulate a depiction of Oppenheimer with many sides and many faces. For the majority of the movie, we observe the world subjectively through his eyes. However, at times we also observe the world from the point of view of his bitter rival, Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.).At a critical moment in the movie, Strauss gives a fiery monologue about the man he sees Oppenheimer to be, and we are left wondering what to believe about who the man truly was. Nolan commonly uses this tool of unanswerable, ambiguous, cliffhanging questions to invite discussion amongst his audiences.There is merit to the historical accuracy of Nolan portraying Oppenheimer as Pablo Picasso portrays The Old Guitarist or as William Faulker portrays Thomas Sutpen in Absalom! Absalom! In a work published in 1973 by Hayden White titled Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-century Europe, White argues that the way a historical event is told is more valuable to any given culture or society than its truthfulness and accuracy. The stories that prevail are the ones that are interesting. Historiography is also inherently reductive, he writes, because it charges historians with creating simple cause and effect relationships that explain history in an understandable way.In Oppenheimer, Nolan's account of history includes a full breadth of points of view, indescribable emotions and ambiguity. He offers both objective facts of history and subjective character viewpoints, leaving us with inconclusive ideas of who J. Robert Oppenheimer really was. We are tasked with making our own decisions as to who he was because, as Nolan highlights, nobody can really say for sure."
There's a reason this movie has been kept super under wraps-it's a biography most of all and not even an interesting one. I don't want to spoil but it centers on an event where they don't leave the room. Yes flashbacks and other things happen but this is not epic Christopher Nolan. Extremely disappointing. It's hard to Go on about a movie that really wasn't good but what was most disappointing was the waste of talent. There's a certain oscar winner that is basically a glorified extra until his big moment at the end. It almost felt like Nolan asked his friends to be in a movie and came up with a script after. Don't rush to a theater. Do not recommend.
"Oliver Stone is calling this a ""Classic""? He's right. When I fell for the rope-a-dope of this oversold, overbaked ham, I became $22 poorer and endured 3 hours of wiki-level storytelling, silly ""drama-inducing"" time jumps, a ridiculously unrealistic Gen. Leslie Groves, made up stories (the poisoned apple, the Einstein conversation), and a pain inducing, punctuated-moment volume level employed as a snore prevention mechanism. My theater's audience was like a zombie convention. No one moved. No one laughed. When I walked outside to the freedom of the early evening sun I did laugh as I exclaimed ""They got me! Classic."" To be fair though, the popcorn was top notch. It's sad that Hollywood is so desperate to duplicate the ""only in theaters"" modus to success demonstrated by last year's Top Gun Maverick that they'll use every trick in the book to get us in there. When they have to sell it as the heaviest roll of film ever made ""it's a 600lb IMAX reel!!!"", you know the movie has some real problems. Halfway through, I begrudgingly admitted to my wife that we should have seen ""Barbie"", and rented this. I wish we had. Now I'm shock-deaf in my left ear, have a popcorn tummy ache, an empty wallet, and I didn't even earn any brownie points. Seriously, if I had been kidnapped by aliens and ""lost"" 3 hours, I would still have more to talk about."
"A very emotional and intense movie. The lead up to the bomb was really captivating & i really loved the decisions they made surrounding the bomb detonation. The movie is stacked with star studded cast with great performances all around, particularly cillian & RDJ. Whilst I found the first hour to be a little slow, it really did pick up from there on. I can understand why some people may find this boring as its dialogue heavy and very little action but i thoroughly enjoyed it and knew what to expect going in. I think its worth knowing that the movie is about the story of his life as many may be misguided on what the movie is about."
"Yes, we all expected this to be visually stunning, with a cast laden with the best in the business giving stellar performances all round. And of course, it delivers in spades.Sergio Leone's westerns were described as operas where the arias are stared rather than sung, and in Nolan's film the camera examines the characters' features in soul-stripping close up, searching for the inner thoughts of the men and women who gave birth to the atomic bomb. These are human beings, flawed and complex, and the film constantly asks who was right and who was wrong, and at the end of it all, does anyone have the moral high ground?At the heart of the film is a tale of a run-of-the-mill functionary with a jealous hatred of a far greater contemporary. The character dynamic of Oppenheimer is so reminiscent of that of Mozart v. Salieri, and the unfolding of the story is just as gripping."
"8.5/10. He uses sound very well, making the bomb actually quieter than the scenes before and especially after it. It also showed the strange life of Oppenheimer which I didn't know much about at all. The visuals were amazing also. Was torn between giving this an 8/10 and 9/10.The movie was much more of a drama than I expected, and showed that Oppenheimer was a morally questionable person, seemingly since his youth, with trying to poison a professor at Cambridge to having affairs. There is one scene that I found extremely weird, it's between Gene and Robert and is where he gets his phrase ""I am become death, destroyer of worlds""."
"I am biased towards historical period pieces as history often tells the most human stories and movies exaggerate these stories for dramatic effect. Nolan understands how to to paint a memoir of Oppenheimer without rose tinged glasses. You won't find the conventional action in this but the words spoken carry a much more compelling conflict than any car chase or battle. This is more about my love for the genre but Nolan made a great historical time piece, and to be Honest, got a lot of help from the uniqueness, complexity, and significance of having one of the most interesting men, Oppenheimer, live during one of the most interesting time periods, the 1930-40s. However these traits are a double edge sword as a lesser team would have fumbled all the details onto the screen, making the audience unable to pick up the pieces of such a complex puzzle. One more thing to remember, THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT OPPENHEIMER, NOT THE ATOMIC BOMB so don't think the bomb is the focus of the movie, it's only one chapter of Oppenheimers life. That being said go out and watch Oppenheimer to support other historical movies as history tells the most compelling stories. Because in fiction characters are good and bad but in history, everyone believes themselves to be good."
"Chris Nolan, never attended film-school, captured audiences with a well-crafted story that's exquisitely delivered through good acting and brilliant cinematography. I like how he intermingled B&W of one story (subplot) with color portrayal of the main-story. Against the backdrop of history and a wide-screen perspective of momentous-events and the natural-beauty of New Mexico, Nolan followed the personal journey of this complex yet important man, Oppenheimer, through his rise and fall. We see all of his human failings to reflect the good and bad in ourselves.His use of a sub-story with the mistress and her bare breasts & buttocks adds a much-needed sensuality to this story dominated by ambitious men interspersed with a relatable performance by Emily Blount. I like it.This film testifies to what and how true actors, demonstrating their craft onscreen, guided by an exceptional director can deliver. Bravo!"
"9.5/10. Let me establish some context before I present my review. I went to watch the movie without any expectations, without prior knowledge about Oppenheimer and without even watching the trailer. My love for Christopher Nolan's work and being a huge fan of majority of the film's cast incited me to watch the movie on the first day itself. If I were to give a review in one sentence, it would be ""Either you will truly love this movie or greatly appreciate it but nobody will hate it"". Everything about this movie is top-notch. The casting, cinematography, direction, background score (which will take your breath away) and pretty much everything else is phenomenal with great attention to detail, something which has become a standard for Nolan's work. Just half hour into the movie and I said to myself that I am witnessing something special. There were more than two times in the movie, when I was genuinely left with my mouth wide open and eyes mesmerising at the screen. If you are interested or have spare time at your arsenal, learning something about the life about the main character and World war 2 in general would be helpful, although not compulsory by any means. It will just help you better understand the nuances of the movie and better grasp it without getting overwhelmed with the introduction of different characters. At the end, I would finish the review by saying that this is truly a cinematic experience, which needs to be enjoyed in a movie theatre in order to properly appreciate the great effort that went behind this now critically acclaimed project."
"There's never been a movie like this before. Hopefully there will be more like it in the future. Thank you to Nolan and the entire production team and cast. This film delivers in every area - it's a piece of art produced by masters of their craft.It's also a very dense and heavy film. It's sweeping but taut. It's calm but urgent. It feels like an immense energy that may either explode or collapse in with violent force, but is kept at a tenuous balance.And as others have said, after it's done you may not know how to feel. (Unless you're the ~6 year old who I saw walking out of my screening, I'm pretty sure he didn't like it, because there's no way in hell a child A] should watch this film or B] can comprehend this film. I digress).It's a film that will stick with you. It's intelligent and demanding storytelling that I hope we'll get to see a lot more like it in the coming years. It's also a good idea to watch it in theaters. The 3 hours fly by."
"This is the another amazing movie from nolan's movie and he complete his collection with making these movies!!!!!!!! This is historic movie from nolan and we enjoy from his real charactristic and i really need to see a real WWII from him, his way need to be near reality.It seems it needs oscar this year and we nolans' fans will support this action for nominate in any movie, cilien murphy is the best actress for doing his act in nolans movie and nolan make any actress great for evey decade, we need to see his future movie to surprise us it would be masterpiece for nolans fans we love him and his movies......"
Oppenheimer Movie is a combo of father of atomic bomb a biopic + documentary script with good direction and screenplay. The background score was good .Normal audience expecting action scenes will not enjoy the movie. Its complete dialogue based movie. The cinematography was good. Emotions has missed in the movie. However the Director has kept the words in Sanskrit in wrong scenes where the director needs to apologies the public. The performance was good .The characters were well executed from the director and performance were well executed from all cast. Mostly this movie will be getting the awards in the future. Overall my rating 2.9/5.
"I was expecting more coverage of the physics and leadership of Dr O. Instead Nolan seems singularly focused on setting the record straight on Oppenheimer. A great cast but the constant switch back and forth to scenes from the past plus conversations drowned by background music, and a focus on the conspiracies surrounding Oppenheimer, got a bit tiring. I expected a different movie. One that used imax to its maximum. I could've just watched this at home, with subtitles to aid my comprehension of otherwise hard-to-hear dialog.This movie was over-hyped. It is okay for a director to interpret rather than illustrate since it's not a documentary, but that cannot be at the expense of telling the full story. I will be wary of watching new movies from Nolan going forward. Your mileage might vary, but I am not a fan."
"""Oppenheimer"" has left an lasting impression on me, a feat only a handful of movies have ever accomplished. Through Nolan's exceptional storytelling and artistic abilities, this film presented history and life from fresh perspectives, which captured my attention from the opening scene to the final credits. I just sat there while the credits rolled in the end, in silence feeling a sense of the horror Oppenheimer must have felt at his accomplishment. I foresee this film having a significant influence on audiences all over the world. Prior to watching this movie, I had little knowledge of Oppenheimer. However, it has given me a fascination and hunger to learn more about him and the stories told in the movie. Oppenheimer and his associates set into motion a series of irreversible events that have significantly shaped our world. His choices and their consequences remind us of the profound impact an individual's life can have on history."
"If you don't like history movies, just don't watch history movies. I'm seeing most the negative reviews here being bored by the ""history lesson"". But this movie is about history, so what did you expect? The ""boring"" part I seriously cannot understand. This was one of the most anxiety inducing, suspenseful, engaging, compelling, and interesting films I've ever seen. I think the fact that it's three hours will rule out a lot of viewers because some people just simply don't have a long enough attention span.This movie isn't really a history lesson. It's an incredibly important story about humanity. What happens when we get our hands on something with unlimited power? And what happens when we pull the trigger? When it's all over, what happens next? The aftermath of the bombings are arguably the best part of the movie. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of regret brought me to tears multiple times.The cinematography was really something else. REALLY. Never have pure visuals alone made me cry, but within the first 15 minutes of this movie, the visuals were so insanely beautiful that I just started crying out of nowhere. I couldn't control it. This movie made me care about the important historical figure of Oppenheimer more than I thought I even could. The way Nolan tells a story in three cohesive storylines is so, well, Nolan-esc, and plain genius. He helps the audience understand this mind-blowing, shocking, and tragic story in an extremely engaging way. Especially for someone like me, who didn't know the personal story of Oppenheimer aside from the Manhatten Project and the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, this movie really opened my eyes and showed me such a tragically beautiful story I didn't realize would hit me in my heart so hard. At the credits, I couldn't speak, I just sat there with my mouth open, tear running down the side of my face, and all I could think was: ""cinema.""The MUSIC. My gosh, Ludwig Goransson! I'm the biggest Hans Zimmer fan. I am a firm believer he's the greatest composer to walk this earth. So, I walked into this movie thinking: ""Man, Hans Zimmer isn't scoring a Nolan film? Screw that. I guess this movie just won't have good music.""
Oh my gosh. I underestimated Ludwig Goransson so much to the point where I am on the verge of sending him a personal apology letter about how sorry I am for doubting him. The music in this film was another contribution to my uncontrollable crying. The reacurring tempo changes in this score make my heart race, I literally forgot to breathe multiple times. What a masterful, beautiful score. It seems to pull a lot of inspiration from Johnny Greenwood's score from There Will Be Blood, with long, violin screeches and horrific orchestral buildups. I loved that, considering Greenwood's score is one of my favorites of all time.The acting was otherworldly. I was nervous Robert Downey Jr. Would show up to this movie acting like Tony Stark, but he really showed me up! He did a really fantastic, unique performance from his usual acting. His character portrayal was phenomenal, wicked, professional, and menacing. But Cillain Murphy's performance I can't even praise with words. I wasn't watching Cillian Murphy. I was watching Oppenheimer.Overall, what a masterpiece. I really can't give all my thoughts in a review, I simply can't. I never will be able to. You can't do that with something THIS good. Instead, I think I'm going to lock myself in a dark room for 5 days to process this film."
"I had been anticipating the release of this movie for months and it did not disappoint. I watched this via IMAX as it was intended. Nolan did a fantastic job as usual, and what we got was a visually stunning, gripping, amazing adaptation of Oppenheimers life. The cinematography, score, and acting was absolutely breathtaking. The effort put in to make this film as realistic as possible really added to the experience. 3 hours felt more like 1 hour 30 mins. Cillian was superb and I highly recommend you watch this movie.Hear me out, this movie is a historical biopic and should be taken as such. Naturally some of the information found here can be found if you do a bit of research online. So if you aren't a fan of history, and do not enjoy movies that center the drama around conversations (aka you're an action movie junky), then this might not be your cup of tea."
"I enjoyed this film completely. I think it was fantastic. I can see why CGI wasn't used for the bomb, because the actual explosion wasn't the main focus in the film. Then again it was.... The acting was top notch and the director did a terrific job. I knew very little about Oppenheimer before this movie. Just an all around impressive film. Yes it's 3 hrs, but honestly what adult can't sit and watch a film this good for few a few hrs. It's Not like they aren't sitting around somewhere else on there butt. I found myself the next day looking up things about Oppenheimer on my phone and watching documentaries about his life. I honestly might go see it again."
The movie was in constant thrill. It didn't let us take our eyes for a second as the minor details were making the ending plot more interesting. The cinematic shots were very perfect and the background music attached to it made them more lively. The accuracy of this historic event was also impressive and the acting of huge stars were on point. Even though the movie just only describes an historic event but the way the director portrayed it made it so much more fun and interesting. Overall the way the movie was directed gave me goosebumps and the background music just added more depth to my goosebumps.
"One of the best cinematic experiences of all time. Everything from acting to directing to the cinematography is really really good. It challenges you as a person and it leaves you feeling an emptiness inside yourself. Robert Downey Jr was outstanding and his monologue at the end is too good. Cillian Murphy was excellent as always and Emily Blunt as well. The trinity test sequence is absolutely phenomenal while obeying the laws of physics of the speed of sound and light. When you hear Oppenheimer's iconic quote ""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds"" it will give you goosebumps and you will enjoy that moment. Overall a great cinematic watch. I definitely reccomend watching it in theatres."
"I may consider myself lucky to be alive to watch Christopher Nolan Works which get better by years.Oppenheimer is - with no doubt-going to be one of the best movies in the history. Amazing cinematography, Exceptional acting and terrifying Soundtracks.All the cast are great from cilian Murphy who is going for the oscar with this role to Rupert Downey jr and Emily blunt and finally rami malik who has small scenes but you will never forget them.I didn't watch it in Imax as i couldn't wait and ran to the nearest cinema but now i will sure book an imax ticket.Don't waste any time, book your ticket and Go watch it.. NOW."
"As always, Christopher Nolan never disappoint me, all his movie was amazing. It's the first time I've watched a Biography movie, and I really liked it, and I'm going to watch it again.The visual and sound effect was amazing and very enjoy to watch.Cillian Murphy also was amazing in this role, and I was sure before I watch the movie, That Cillian Murphy will be a great actor in this role, and definitely will take the Oscar this year, just by watching the trailer, I watched the movie with my friends, and none of them loved and watched the movie to the end, except me.I know this movie not for everyone, it's for the people who admire the directing, the acting, and the cinematography."
"Don't get me wrong Oppenheimer is a good solid movie, but it does suffer from major problems that Nolan is incredibly stubborn about since Tennet (I consider tennet a satire on Nolan's own work, the movie was a total joke)Now comes Oppenheimer, you can tell immediately as the movie starts Nolan has put in a solid effort and hard work here, the visuals, lightening and cinematography immediately come off as top notch. The storyline is well written and presented, but then there are many problems with this movie such asit's loud, and I mean, extremely loud, lawsuit material loud, I could imagine number of hearing loss caused by this movie it is not necessary at all. Nolan increasingly is turning up the volume on his moviesthe soundtrack is amazing however in many parts it seemed overused and doesn't fit in the scene at all, was completely out of place. You'd have a seen with mediocre dialogue and this extremely high pitch overly dramatic and impeding doom music play but really thought big is happening. And you had the tennet style reverbs play at almost every other scene and twist it got old, why use tennet style soundtrack , make something unique like Nolan previous movies.the third act was totally unnecessary and long, it did get boring. They spent way too much time on the silly security clearance thing, yes we know the government and intelligence agencies are corrupt we see it to this day with trump and others being unfairly convicted. Ok we get it but don't spend an entire hour on it. Reminded me a bit of sully it seems very much inspired by sully the moviethe performance went from really good to really bad throughout the movie, there was clear inconsistency. The sex scenes are super cringe infact in one scene you can see the lady is humping his leg, it was so badly edited.Overall I cannot give this movie a masterpiece label, due to this issues. I do hope however Nolan keeps making movies, i do love his vision and mind. I guess tennet taught him a lesson and he seems to try harder now. However I don't know if we will ever see Nolan make something legendary, his last masterpiece was dunkirk and that was his peak."
"I really like Nolan, he is one of the best! Unfortunately, I fall on media hype and went to cinema with few movie junkies such as myself. Yes I didn't expect entertainment in this genre, but after 30min I literally waited movie to finish. It is super difficult to follow, boring and annoying conversations.. Mat Damon was a joke together with Einstein 😂😂😂😂 and Josh H. I do not know what to say..
I really excited something more interesting and all I got this boring never ending movie.. I would agree with some random comment: this movie is like you are watching movie trailers.. never ending movie trailer 😂😂😂
I was actually laughing on some super serious moments.. that can only say how I lost connection with the characters and plotMaybe, if you like weird stuff like Tenet you will like this Openhimer as well
I am giving this movie 2 / 10 just because I stayed until the end, but first thing on my mind was: I just wasted 3h of my life."
"This movie is not for everyone but for those who like to see strong theme, wonderfull direction and those who are aware of characters and there importance in modern day science. There are multi sequel historical events and personalities which are responsible for military capability of The USA. This movie also tells about the society behaviour as your achievements can have both positive and negative impacts. I highly recommend movie this to people who are deep thinkers who seek for sense of event while watching any movie, also the people who appreciate wonders of science experiment. Must watch it."
"For the first time to see another side of science
Movie will have a mix of feeling between sadness and happiness regardless of the politics inside it.Again Nolan got to have his own touch even in a Biography movies.The way he created different timelines and transferred between them repeatedly is made some complexity to the movie, but I love this personally
Soundtrack is unbelievable from the beginning of the movie.And you cannot say anything for the acting.I would watch it again and again. I didn't feel the length of the movie. It was breathtakingMan, I can't wait when Nolan will release another picture!"
"Our government is scary... The main theme behind Nolan's newest film based upon the creation of the atomic bomb. Wonderful acting, powerful score and really good storytelling are just some of the many great things this movie had to offer. A very educational film as well as riveting, but the one major word I have for this film is, tragic. A group of men and women who changed the world in the deserts of New Mexico, who worked a miracle that would shape the future of planet earth, only to have their creation used for war and death ... this film was more of a warning than for entertainment purposes."
"Kantara, KGF PART 1-2 , PUSPA, Created for mass ....but no one can match Christopher Nolan' Directorial Epic 'Oppenheimer' ......Some say it's boring and too lengthy.... But if you sit back and think it as a Biopic and the struggles which Oppenheimer had in his life you will realise the film made full justice to his character and his story.....apart from controversial statement of bringing Bhagwat Gita phrase ....the film has done no wrong .....Brilliant Story Telling ....
Yes the first half was long and Boring but it had to be ........
2nd half was so fast paced and answers lot of questions.......Wait for last 20 seconds it will create goosebumps......I give 9/10 for this Epic ......"
"A theater rattling experience! That's the first thing to come to mind. Very few movies create such a cinematic experience as Oppenheimer, however, this can be expected as Christopher Nolan tends to deliver grand movies!Oppenheimer is a movie that inspires, cautions, and compels audiences as they experience the life of a figure that was moved by science, compelled to build some revolutionary and new, and suffer it's aftermath. Such feeling of grand scale surrounding a single individual like Oppenheimer has not been seen since interstellar.The epic soundtrack does wonders to contribute to this sense of important and is consistent with Nolan's other films.Overall, this is a movie that can only truly be experienced in an IMAX theater and deserves a watch!"
"We all been excited to see it for months. And thank god it wasn't disappointing. The cinematography, the actors, the visual effects, the sound effects, the timeline and the directing were all amazing!!! I heard alot of people saying ""it wasn't what they thought"" i mean.... what did you expect to see ha?... it's not a film about the atomic bomb... ""it was a film about the man who created the atomic bomb"" there is a big difference between those two things... i know that there was ALOT of dialogue... and the timeline was very complicated... but guys... (it's christopher nolan's film). And that's all what i have to say."
"Oppenheimer is a movie that you 100% have to pay attention to as it will jump around to many different places, however, if you can keep track and put everything together.......well this movie is gonna leave you speechless.After I was done watching it and driving home I think two things came to mind, 1- this movie needs to be a seen a second time to fully understand it and grasp everything. 2- like Harvey Dent says in the dark knight rises ""you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain"". When in the scenes of him trying get his security clearance reinstated it seemed as if a lot of people made him out to be someone who even after all that he did was really someone bad and not to be trusted. Even after the bomb was dropped and he even realized what he created might be something that will do more harm than it will good and that like he said to Einstein in the end, they very well may have created a reaction."
"I was highly anticipating this movie since the trailer dropped earlier this year since I was a big fan of Nolan's Dunkirk. Going in, I was scared that this movie wasn't going to live up to my expectation but by the end I could say that it has surpassed it. The visuals were truly spectacular, the score was fantastic, cinematography even more so. Cillian Murphy's acting was very good as J. Robert Oppenheimer. I felt that he encapsulates the character of Oppenheimer very authentically and makes him a very complicated figure that we could all sympathise with despite being the father of one of the most destructive weapons that humanity has ever created. All of that couldn't have been done without Murphy's acting. The side characters were also pretty well played by their respective actors with my favourites being Lewis Strauss played by Robert Downey Jr. And Albert Einstein by Tom Conti. All of this combined making the movie one of the most engaging that I have seen for quite some time in theatres. 10/10."
"This movie had the potential to be a powerful and moving piece of cinema, but unfortunately it fell short in several key areas. Despite being based on a true story to make it more a compelling storytelling, the film delivered more like a documentary type of portraying things. The emotional excitement that one would expect from Nolan's films was lacking, leaving my feeling somewhat underwhelmed.One of the main issues with the movie was the lack of character development. The characters felt flat and one-dimensional, and their motivations and actions were not always clear. This made it difficult for me to connect with them on an emotional level.Additionally, the use of jumpscare sound effects felt unnecessary and detracted from the overall experience. Rather than adding to the tension and suspense, these sound effects felt jarring and a little bit out of place.In conclusion, while this movie had potential, it failed to deliver in several key areas. The lack of emotional excitement, poor character development, and unnecessary use of jumpscare sound effects all contributed to a less than satisfying viewing experience."
"""Oppenheimer"" is about nebulous men struggling with identity. We're told that the problem is morality, but the finished film - the sum total of Christopher Nolan's vision, script, direction, and ego (so much ego) - has little to say about the catastrophic technology it supposedly chronicles. It barely registers as a biopic, and it certainly isn't a meditation on history or even the bomb. Instead, it's three hours of a director insisting that he has something important to say, but that you should be smart enough to understand what that is without him having to accomplish it.And that is a problem that no one seems to be mentioning in their rapturous reviews of ""Oppenheimer"". What exactly is it all about?The entire film is so monotone and self-serious that one often forgets why any of the talking heads are important. They all speak and act like the same character. And honestly, they aren't particularly important. Edited linearly, ""Oppenheimer"" would be a quite simple, drab film. The performances are great, the roles thankless. So much so that when the only characters that suggest real people are not on screen - Downey's frustrated Lewis Strauss and Damon's General Groves - we feel their absence. Murphy does admirable work, as does Krumholtz as Isador Rabi, but really, these are flat, rote characters that gain empathy through persistence, not necessarily precision. In fact, that's the game that ""Oppenheimer"" plays: it only ever manages to emphasize the grey areas of it's central ethical dilemma.To that end, the bomb really doesn't matter. The devastating after effects of the device are measured in terms of its function as science and as a scientific albatross around Oppie's neck. The human cost - and the cost on Oppenheimer himself - are given passing glances, leaving us to the real meat of the film, which is, in fact, conference rooms. ""Oppenheimer"" is about men talking. Make no mistake.This makes for a tortuously obtuse and often offensively glib first hour. With the intrusive, often silly Tangerine Dream-esque score highlighting every petty argument and special-effects-imagining-the-cosmos scene and the spot-the-celebrity platforming, the only sign of humanity we get is literally writhing human flesh. Female nudity is a plot point for ""Oppenheimer"", though as in most Nolan productions, women barely exist. Here are two of Nolan's three female types: tragic trollop and tragic nag. Really, these could be any two actresses. They don't matter. Make no mistake, this is a film about men talking.The second hour is genius. Cross cutting between the genesis of the bomb and the political machinations surrounding it, you get the sense that Nolan has really found a moment of true excitement. That sets up an incredibly disappointing third act which reveals exactly how weak Nolan's script is once it literally loses the power of nuclear annihilation. Everything, in fact, comes together over a very famous meeting that, historically, never happened. Poetic license? That's a problem when you waste 3 hours browbeating the audience with conference room minutiae and a script lifting from actual government documents.""Oppenheimer"" - in an ironic note that I've seen leveled against ""Barbie"" - is a film that wants to have it's cake and eat it too. We're told that the bomb is loathsome and dreadful and unethical pornography, and so Nolan knows that we have to see it. And we want it big and messy and full of ejaculate. Never mind that 300,000 human lives were what Oppie saw every time he closed his eyes - no - Nolan returns us again and again to the conference room, where petty insults manifest in conspiracies and smirking. Lots of smirking.So what has Nolan accomplished here? The same end that he arrives at in each of his films: stolid detachment, pseudo-intellectualism, and stunning cinematic craftsmanship. Unfortunately, the movie is only worth an 90 minutes of inspired filmmaking. The rest is simply pretentious fat. Or rather, the rest is Nolan's insistence that he has something so important to say, but never gets around to it in 3 hours. Oppenheimer may be an infinitely interesting human being, but as a film character, he's cardboard, no matter how hard Murphy works to give him wrinkles.Defenders of Nolan (and they are Legion) will explain to you that this is a great anti-war film, but it tells a lot more than it shows. It's not a satire and as a history lesson, it certainly omits large sections of the timeline that may have provided some drama, like say, the fates of Daghlin and Slotin. Frankly, this is the same tiresome walk and talk that weighs down the typical Aaron Sorkin history lesson, somehow rendering all of the characters and all of the audience to the same level of ""look at how smart we are just for having experienced this.""None of this matters if the film moves you emotionally. I felt nothing during these 180 minutes. Certainly, I didn't come away with a greater understanding of the scope of the bomb, nor did I learn much about Oppenheimer. I learned a lot, however, about how meticulously exhausting Nolan is when Downey Jr isn't on screen."
"It's a fantastic movie with such a perfect combination of artist and the director. In the end couldn't figure out if anything should have been deleted or added. It's so well balanced, it's definitely not a movie for everyone. Don't expect any drama or action sequences. It's a story about a guy a scientist who didn't fall into something and has superpowers. His just a scientist who created something.it's for war nerds or history nerds like me who watch history channel for hours or still get fascinated by WW documentary and stories. There's are so many lives involved, so many people who never got a chance to tell there story. Many people would have lived without knowing about this guy. It's just a very beautiful movie."
"This. Will. Win. Everything. Under. The. Sun. Whether all the credit goes to Cillian Murphy's brillance or to Nolan for tapping Cillian, we may never know. But both combine for something that will go unmatched for a long time. An honest biopic about Robert Oppenheimer that doesn't provide any answers because there are no easy answers. Instead, it lends to the audience a masterwork of a story worth pondering over & over. This goes above Nolan's past best works in Dunkirk and Inception, not only due to the refined wizardry of Nolan's genius but also to the nature of what the film sets out to explore -- that momentous juncture in human history when we couldn't mathmatically rule out that we, as humanity, could destroy ourselves in the very attempt to save ourselves--with all of our human complexicites webbed throughout."
"Awesome, NOLAN .. THANKS FOR THIS. WE REMEMBER THIS. Your cinematic brilliance . 1st half at some parts while charcters discussing little boring feeling i felt but except that genius of a cinema. Watched first time your film in theatre it's great . Thanks .. CILLIAN MURPHY , EMILY BLUNT, ROBERT DOWNEY JR. , RAMI MALEK ACTING AWESOME. WATCHED IT HERE IN #NMAX THEATRE IN MY HOMETOWN #ANANTAPURAM WHICH IS A DISTRICT IN #ANDHRAPRADESH IN #INDIA. I ENJOYED. THANKS. 2ND HALF 5/5. FIRST HALF 3/5. THIS IS HOW WE INDIANS WATCH A FILM .OVERALL 8/10. THANKS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO EXPERIENCE YOUR FILM. THANKS TO EVERYBODY."
I feel now Openheimer is more popular than Albert Einstein after this movie and everyone knows. Great movie best screenplay another masterpiece from Christopher Nolan. Apparently scientific part in the movie was very small. They could have added more how they built the bomb. What is heavy waters. I found that in the scene where Openheimer sitting in his house with his wife on a dining table there is an Ethernet port or analog telephone port in the back wall. I observed this 2 times in the movie. I am sure that there was no ethernet and phone ports. I am writing it here because I could not find anywhere to report. Let me know if you feel the same.
"In my opinion, the film Oppenheimer is one of the best films in the history of the film industry. I've never felt an explosion in a film as much as I did in Oppenheimer. In my cinema I could literally feel the pressure wave. In addition, the plot of the film was written and filmed absolutely perfectly. You were emotionally taken a lot and the events were presented in great detail and accurately. For this reason, I cannot understand many of the criteria, for example. Either you don't have patience because the film is so long or many don't understand it because they don't have the necessary intelligence to be able to understand the film, because otherwise you would give the film at least a 9.0. As for the acting, I can only say that it was an absolute champion performance by everyone. I also take my hat off to the absolutely legendary execution and direction of Nolan and the film's producers. Thank you for letting me sit in such a masterpiece."
"This was one of the most transcendent, intellectually harrowing and emotionally horrifying experiences I've ever had. Not at the movies, EVER. I believe this is by far Nolan's most emotional piece (yes, I'd put this above interstellar) and as someone who needs no introduction in terms of cerebral movies, it was absolutely incredible for that to be paired with a sense of visceral character explorations. And make no mistake, this movie will haunt you. And terrify you. I'm the biggest horror nut around, having seen Jaws before I turned 8, and from then, the shining, Blair witch, Halloween, terrifier, NONE of them scared me like this. This movie scared me so much I started crying and shaking in my seat."
"In the world of Insatiable and ADHD'ic people. This movie is in vain. The wrong time you could say. People who are vastly into science or show interest in science will find this movie very attractive. I've seen people fluctuating about their opinions on this film like anything. Nolan is truly a genius and he knows what he's doing. The split between the black and white and other sequences is elegantly done as Nolan shows metaphorically claims chain reactions. Beautiful to watch. I don't think there is any cinematic genius than Nolan. 3 hours is action-packed for people who want to watch. For the name-sake views it's just low grade. I've seen people sleep in the first half and all of a sudden it got interesting in the second half. Nowadays people can't understand setups. You can't make a 3-hour film full of explosion scenes. It was a perfect setup to guide us deep into his story. Clearly, the best film to be released lately.Wanna talk about it every day but for the non viewers im going to keep it non spoiler. The last scene almost took my breath away. Trust me this world is a bad place to live on."
"""Oppenheimer"" is a biographical thriller film written and directed by Christopher Nolan (""The Dark Knight trilogy"", ""Inception"",
""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk""), based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Starring Cillian Murphy in the lead role, in addition to Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, it subverts the usual biopic formula to create a brilliantly layered examination of a man throughout all of his incredible accomplishments and fundamental flaws.During the height of the Second World War, theoretical physicist
J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is recruited by the United States government to oversee the ""Manhattan Project"", a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first nuclear weapons. After becoming acquainted with the project's director Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer and the General come to an agreement that the best place to carry out such an undertaking is the vast desert of Los Alamos, New Mexico. As numerous other scientists and their families are brought in to this discreet location, Oppenheimer works tirelessly around the clock to build this weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis can devise their own. With the War raging and personal troubles mounting, Oppenheimer continues to push himself to his utmost limits, but soon suffers the consequences of his dedication."
"A True Nolan fan here...What can i say about Oppenheimer...
The first hour i liked the best.The build up, the science, the visions of particals and Energy.The second hour was also desent, but deviated more from the bomb and gravitated towards Oppenheimer himself.The last hour, was to much of a politcal drama and that played out like a losing chess game.I have to adres the elephant in the room.The ""big""'explosion was a big letdown. Even in IMAX, except for the sound it wasn't all that spectaculair.The acting was top nodge, Oscar worthy, Maybe even more For RD jr than the others.Music was briljant but overall it was not the bombshell i expected."
"I love all Nolan movies , but Jesus this was boring #boringLots of boring american politics , very little science #boringI came away not really caring much for the Oppenheimer character, I neither liked or disliked him , him getting screwed out of his next Job was boring , I couldn't care less , the guy did seem to be easily manipulated so maybe should not have top level security clearance #boringPointless being shot in iMax really waste of moneyThe only thing I liked was the use of sound , it had to use sound to prevent it being a 3 hour talk fest.Downey junior was the best actor in the film."
It might be one of the most accomplished Nolan movies. The movie is centred on the carachtere of Oppenheimer and the challanges he have faced when making the atomic bomb in a biographical manner . The movie also expose events from oppenheimer life begore and after the project.The cinematography of the movie is just phenomenonal. One of the biggest strenght of the movie is it's story line and editing (also tge black n white passages) that makes it even more exciting to watch and the 3 hours definitly didn't feelt too long. One point: it's adviceable to do some research on Oppenheimer before going to watch so u dont feel lost with all historical references !

"This could easily be Nolans best work yet or ever. The only nit pick I have is the audio mixing with music and dialogue that Nolan has struggled with in his past couple movies, is still a slight problem here. Other than that, the casting (Cillian and RDJ are oscar bound), epic music, dialogue, cinematography, storytelling is all a masterpiece. THIS IS NOT A MOVIE ABOUT THE ATOMIC BOMB. ITS ABOUT OPPENHEIMER. Nolan tells the story of oppenheimers insane life pre, post and during the war to perfection and Cillian Murphy makes you feel everything he went through along the way. At no point did I feel like the movie was dragging because it has a breakneck pace that could be tiring but it keeps you glued to the screen. If you don't give yourself the chance to see this movie in theaters (IMAX preferably), you are robbing yourself of an opportunity to see one of the most important movies in recent memory."
"""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic masterpiece that reaffirms Christopher Nolan's position as a visionary director. With meticulous attention to historical detail, he takes us on an enthralling journey into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist and key figure behind the development of the atomic bomb. The cast's performances are nothing short of exceptional, with each actor breathing life into their respective characters, making them relatable and engaging.Nolan's storytelling prowess shines throughout the film, as he weaves a complex narrative that delves into Oppenheimer's personal struggles, ethical dilemmas, and the moral weight he carried with his groundbreaking work. The portrayal of the scientist's internal conflicts adds depth and humanizes a historical figure often viewed through a one-dimensional lens.Undoubtedly, the soundtrack is one of the film's standout features. Ludwigs Göransson's mesmerizing compositions perfectly complement the unfolding drama, heightening the emotional impact of each scene. The music creates an immersive experience, amplifying the tension and adding layers of emotion to pivotal moments.Visually, ""Oppenheimer"" is a marvel to behold. Nolan's signature style of practical effects is on full display, resulting in breathtaking visuals that transport the audience to the World War II era. The attention to historical accuracy extends to the production design, costumes, and set pieces, which further immerse viewers in the period.The film's pacing keeps audiences engaged throughout its runtime, striking a fine balance between action-packed sequences and quieter character-driven moments. Nolan masterfully maintains suspense, making the historical events feel as gripping and relevant as ever.While ""Oppenheimer"" is undeniably a gripping and intellectually stimulating film, some may find it challenging to follow its intricate narrative, requiring focused attention to fully appreciate its nuances. However, this complexity ultimately rewards viewers with a thought-provoking experience that lingers long after the credits roll.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic tour de force that leaves an indelible mark on the viewer. Christopher Nolan's brilliant direction, coupled with an outstanding cast and a mesmerizing soundtrack, elevates the biopic into a transcendent exploration of humanity, ethics, and the consequences of scientific advancements. This is a film that demands to be seen and discussed, solidifying its place among the greatest works of modern cinema."
"One of the best films in a long time I can't praise it enough it describes history beautifully. Honestly going to the cinema was an unbelievable experience even when you realize that no computer effects were used in the film so it's really incredible. The cast is so well cast and the resemblance to real actors is just amazing. Cillian Murphy should deserve an award for this film because he played the role so well , I hope fiom will be properly appreciated . The explosion scene was one of the best I've ever seen the silence and the look I can't get enough of it , More films like this !😉😉😉😉😉T."
"Oppenheimer is a cinematic masterpiece that exemplifies Christopher Nolan's unparalleled directorial genius. The movie's gripping narrative, coupled with awe-inspiring sound engineering and music, makes it an unforgettable cinematic experience.Nolan's attention to detail is evident throughout the film, and the sound engineering plays a crucial role in enhancing the storytelling. The use of sound, or lack thereof, during the atom bomb explosion scene is a stroke of brilliance. As the bomb detonates, the absence of sound leaves the audience in a state of eerie silence, mirroring the overwhelming shock experienced by the characters. When the sound eventually emerges after the fireball has vanished, it brilliantly conveys the delayed chain reaction, adding to the intensity and realism of the moment.The music in Oppenheimer complements the visuals impeccably, heightening the emotional impact of each scene.The cinematography is mesmerizing, with each shot meticulously crafted to showcase the film's historical context and psychological depth. The unique angles and perspectives allow us to understand the characters on a deeper level, giving insight into their struggles, motivations, and emotions. The visuals alone are a testament to Nolan's mastery as a storyteller.The stellar cast, led by Cillian Murphy's exceptional performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer, elevates the film to new heights. Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, and the entire ensemble deliver powerful and nuanced portrayals, breathing life into their respective characters. The chemistry among the cast is palpable, adding layers of authenticity to the relationships portrayed on screenIn conclusion, Oppenheimer is a cinematic triumph that showcases Christopher Nolan's brilliance as a director. The impeccable sound engineering and captivating music draw the audience deeper into the story, while the unique shots and mesmerizing visuals create an immersive experience. The lack of sound during the atom bomb explosion scene is a masterstroke, heightening the impact and intensity of the moment. The entire cast's remarkable performances, led by Cillian Murphy, make this film an extraordinary cinematic journey. Oppenheimer is an exceptional testament to Nolan's filmmaking prowess and is undoubtedly a must-watch for any cinephile."
"Nolan's newest movie, which tells the story of the brilliant J Robert Oppenheimer, will satisfy his fandom with a full Nolan experience. Fast pacing, unsequenced scenes loaded with dialogue and played by a great cast will keep you on the edge of your seat. Both Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Deliver their best performance to date.The movie tells two stories, the story of the atomic bomb and the story of Oppenheimer. Trying to do both in one movie is ambitious and results in a constant salvo of information which might not be everyones cup of tea.The story of the atomic bomb takes roughly two thirds of the film to create and is very fast paced. The pace is justified by the sense of urgency to work against the clock against the nazis. Matt Damon as Leslie Groves creates short moments of tranquility as one of the only layman characters surrounded by the intellectual brightest of their time. The culmination of this part, the explosion of the bomb, is done beautiful and created silence throughout the packed cinema.After the atomic bomb comes the nuclear fallout. Not only for the people in Japan, but also in Oppenheimers life. Not radiation poisioning, but opportunism by lesser men during McCarthyism plague Oppenheimers life. This part of the movie has flaws. It is not shown to the viewer why the security clearance of Oppenheimer is of such importance that it needs another hour of screenplay. The motives are clear, Robert Downey Jr is great as Strauss, but the deposition scenes feel unnecessary, Oppenheimers character development is limited and it takes the spotlight away from the moral questions surrounding using science for mass destruction. Nolan clearly signals to the viewer that the movie is a biography of Oppenheimer, rather than the atomic bomb.I'm unsure if the movie needed the villainization of the Strauss character when the real villain was the creation of Oppenheimer and his team.Anyway, Nolan did it again. You leave the cinema with questions about good, bad, lesser evil and the purpose of war. The Red Scare is purposefully portrayed as yet another time in history when dissenters were structurally humiliated and the Truman scene is a satirical wink to the Anglosphere. Einsteins scenes were thoughtful. Bohr's question is yet to be anwered, will the bomb end all wars, or will the bomb end civilization?"
"""Titan! To whose immortal eyes
The sufferings of mortality,
Seen in their sad reality,
Were not as things that gods despise;""In his poem Prometheus (1816), Lord Byron praised the revolutionary deeds of the legendary Greek character who stole fire from the Olympian gods and gave it to mankind to prosper technology, science, and civilisation more broadly. These words rightfully characterize the protagonist of the film Oppenheimer (2023), who rather invented a source of fire with the intention of attaining peace and ending war and devastation. Christopher Nolan's dubiously called magnum opus is vastly based on the 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. This biographical thriller delves into the intriguing life and dilemmatic psychology of Julius Robert Oppenheimer, the Father of Atom Bomb. Cillian Murphy stars as Dr Oppenheimer, with Emily Blunt as his wife, Katherine Oppenheimer, Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves, Oppenheimer's military handler, Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss, a senior member of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, and Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock, a member of the Communist Party in the USA. Apart from the brilliant job done by the ensemble cast, the outstanding screenplay, groundbreaking background score and cinematic grandeur makes it a sublime marriage of far-reaching excellence.The movie begins with a colour close-up shot of Murphy as Oppenheimer labeled as ""Fission"" and the following scene features a similar shot of Downey Jr. As Strauss in monochrome titled as ""Fusion."" While the colour sequences represent the subjective elements and depict Oppenheimer's perspective, showing his moral struggle and personal relationships, the black-and-white sections present the objective historical perspective, focusing on the repercussions of the atomic bomb, particularly the hearings against Oppenheimer. Thus from the very beginning, Nolan epitomizes the theme of duality and sets the mood of ambivalence in the audience's minds. Scuffling with homesickness and anxiety while studying in Cambridge, the 22-year-old Oppenheimer leaves for his tutor Patrick Blackett a poisoned apple but undergoes a change of conscience and prevents Niels Bohr from eating it.Nolan adeptly employs a variety of allusions to develop Oppenheimer's personality and indicate his wide-ranging interest in many other areas. Murphy holds in his hand The Waste Land (1922) by T. S. Eliot, a classic work of modern literature that captures the disenchantment of the post-war generation. He also visits a museum and is struck by Pablo Picasso's Seated Woman with Arms Crossed (1937), which was painted during the Spanish Civil War the same year as Guernica. In addition to providing an early indication of Oppenheimer's kaleidoscopic and fragmented mind, this montage sequence, combined with Oppenheimer's observation of the Cubist paintings, the dazzling fire, and the smashing of wine glasses, approximates the nonlinear structure of the movie. Instead of digging into the details of fusion and fission, Nolan instead uses quick cuts to stunning visuals of particles, stars, and light to evoke the sublimity of these ideas while playing Ludwig Göransson's score at its loudest.The audience is then taken through the long process behind the Trinity Test. Oppenheimer has been recruited by U. S. Army General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) to supervise the Manhattan Project and create an atomic bomb. Being Jewish, he is particularly driven by the possibility that the Nazis have a nuclear weapons program underway, under Heisenberg's direction. In Los Alamos, New Mexico, Oppenheimer assembles a group of scientists that includes Edward Teller, Isidor Isaac Rabi, and David Hill with the objective of secretly developing the weapon that, despite its possible worldwide repercussions will rescue the world. During the development, Bohr visits and Oppenheimer discusses with Albert Einstein the potential for such a bomb to set off a domino effect that might wipe out humanity. Eventually, the bomb is completed and the Trinity test goes off without a hitch. During the spine-chilling background score and the fast cut shots moments before the blast and the remaining silence afterwards, the audience cannot even blink for a second. William L. Laurence wrote, ""The big boom came about 100 seconds after the Great Flash-the first cry of a newborn world. It brought the silent, motionless silhouettes to life, and gave them a voice. A loud cry filled the air.""While everyone around him was experiencing unadulterated satisfaction, Oppenheimer briefly considered all the destructive potential of this weapon. He remembers verses from the Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita as he observes the humongous mushroom cloud rising into the heavens above Point Zero- ""We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, and a few people cried. Most people were silent."" He has dutifully carried out his tasks, much like Prince Arjuna, but their menacing results have turned him into an eradicating miscreant. He speaks the words of Lord Vishnu with revolting terror and insatiable guilt- ""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.""In Robert Louis Stevenson's The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Dr. Jekyll wrote to Utterson, ""If I am the chief of sinners, I am the chief of sufferers also."" When America drops the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the resounding success of the Trinity Test, Oppenheimer had a similar epiphany. We see a glimpse of the psychological outcomes of Oppenheimer's remarkable accomplishment-guilt, emotional suppression, and rational justifications. He realizes, ""physics and the teaching of physics, which is my life, now seems irrelevant."" Oppenheimer's oscillating psyche is affected by the incessant pounding of the triumphant Americans on the wooden floor. Oppenheimer opens his statement with the words ""The world will remember this day,"" but his repeated pauses and downcast look give the impression that he is nothing but a puppet to the U. S. government.""What was thy pity's recompense?A silent suffering, and intense; The rock, the vulture, and the chain, All that the proud can feel of pain.""This elucidation from Byron's Prometheus can be distinguished in the flaming blue eyes of Cillian Murphy in which we see not sincerity but a kind of unaltered shock. He keeps giving his speech but in his unconscious mind glimpses the frightening atrocities and gruesomeness caused by his own invention. It reminds us of what Eliot wrote in The Waste Land- ""For you know only a heap of broken images."" The shaky background, glowing visuals and handheld close-up shots add to the horrifying consequences of the bombing. The constant psychological dilemma of Oppenheimer becomes evident as he walks out of the exhilarating crowd and steps on the scorched dead body almost turning into ""a handful of dust.""""Thy Godlike crime was to be kind"" - writes Byron about Prometheus. Oppenheimer begs President Truman at their meeting to prevent the creation of more powerful weapons like the hydrogen bomb. Though he utters ""I have blood on my hands,"" but Truman perceives his distress as cowardice. Truman is played by veteran actor Gary Oldman, who gives a brief but impactful performance. Finally, after various hearings in the courtroom, Oppenheimer's security clearance is revoked tarnishing his reputation and reducing his political influence. Later, at a Senate confirmation hearing David Hill reveals Lewis Strauss's personal reasons for orchestrating Oppenheimer's destruction. The audience may ponder the same question Oppenheimer posed at a party in Berkeley - ""What happens to stars when they die?"" The ""star"" of the nation who contributed to the victory in the war is shunned. However, Nolan's own assessment of Oppenheimer as ""the most important person who ever lived,"" prompts us to consider another question - ""Do the stars die?""The ending of the film calls back to an earlier moment of Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) speaking by a pond. We now examine the same situation from Oppenheimer's perspective in colour as compared to Strauss' initial, monochromatic perspective. Einstein, who has been shown as an avuncular figure throughout the film gently asks a few questions to Oppenheimer and makes a prognostication. ""Now it's your turn to deal with the consequences of your achievement"" - speaks Einstein who personally experienced the agonising effects of the scientific establishment. Oppenheimer will be awarded and salmon feasts will be hosted in his honour, he predicts and says, ""They'll pat you on the back, tell you all is forgiven."" While he talks, we see brief flashes forward of Oppenheimer as an elderly man receiving rewards from the President and being formally celebrated by former adversaries. ""Just remember, it won't be for you. It will be for them,"" Einstein adds. The film's closing frames which mirror the opening scenes, serve as a sobering reminder of how interconnected everything is and how decisions made by one affect the rest of the world.The circular ripples in the pond that symbolizes the chain reaction of atoms recall the raindrops on a puddle at the beginning of the film, creating rings like the radius of an atomic bomb. When Isador Rabi uses a compass to mark the evident radius of the bomb on a map during a roundtable meeting, the circle metaphor may be seen in action once more. Nolan incorporates water in various parts of the film not only is a recurring antithesis to the diabolical catastrophe and serves as a symbol of serene and peace. The contrast between the two opposite elements sets the tone for the rest of the movie. While standing by the pond and gazing into it, Oppen."
"I had high expectations but was disappointed. The performances are good.But the story becomes too much about him and not about the Manhattan project.The non linear story telling really spoils the rhythm and tempo of the Manhattan project.The story of the project itself is more interesting but it has gotten sidelined.In a sense Nolan tries so hard to keep you at the edge of your seat, by all the non linear story, you actually feel bored. Yes the movie drags!It really depends on what you want from the movie.Do you want a straightforward narrative that explains the chronology and challenges
of the Manhattan project? Or do you care more about the thoughts and concerns and
emotional issues and values and tribulations of Oppy with some of the chronology and issues of the project thrown in?I would have liked the former. Hence I feel ""Fat man and little boy"" starring Paul Newman is
a more interesting story. That story focuses on the project and also the various characters
associated with the project. Though even in that movie Oppy has a central role, the project
really is the centerpiece. Here the project does not get as much of the focus it deserves.It leaves you wanting."
"If you think this is Nolan's best movie or even ""at the same level"" than his best movies... then you actually don't like Nolan. At all.Yes, this biopic has all the things that make his style, but no matter how complex Nolan tries to make this... in the end it's just a biopic and nothing can ever change that.Good for him if this was intentional, to get into good graces with the critics, maybe even win some awards that he should've won with Prestige, Inception, TDK or Tenet.But this is a (mostly) boring biopic (with two or three 5/10 minutes good sequences and a great 15' ending)... but in 3 freaking hours, and for people that can't and won't accept his big, fun, entertaining movies are also intellectually superior, as they won't ever accept a popular thing can be also smart."
"Christopher Nolan delivered on essentially every front with Oppenheimer. This film was able to encapsulate the complexity and moral web of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life. Right away, with the opening scene, this film instills in you the seriosity with which it should be taken. Actors Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Delivered particularly stellar performances, though across the board, this film's acting was incredible. The soundtrack of Oppenheimer deserves equal praise, and though the plot can be slow at points, it makes sense why. This is not a film to be rushed. Amongst his other films, this movie stands above all of them, except for, perhaps, Interstellar."
"If you are aware of basic events of life of Oppenheimer and are not expecting a super spicy movie with loads of drama but beautiful cinematography, This movie is for you.Everybody knew the story of life of Oppenheimer but Cristopher Nolan brings it in a different form on big screen. It is a heavy - dialogue movie where some scenes may look a little stretchy and off putting but believe me movie never bores.The main highlight is the trinity test and movie sums up after that. You may not have a super positive review before trinity test scene but it all changes after that where the beautiful acting of cilian murphy shockes you.In end, every actor was not good not bad but perfect. Best actor for me in the movie was RDJ who just does a super new role. Even if you are not aware of Chris Nolan's work, movie is a one-time must see, even only for the cinematography experience."
"Nolan has a reputation for mind-bending, twisty-turny movies that leave your brain in knots, right? Well, despite it's magnificence, ""Oppenheimer"" doesn't exactly fit that bill.Oppenheimer takes a different approach. It aims to give us a true portrayal of the protagonist, the man behind the atomic bomb. It's a more linear narrative than what we're used to.There's one little thing that caught me off guard - and not in a satisfactory way: the nudity scenes. Thy felt forced, graphic, and out of place.The other surprise was the intensity of the dialogue. It felt clunky and sometimes killed the momentum of the film. Nolan usually has this knack for sharp and memorable lines, but this time around, it fell a little flat.I found myself waiting for those powerful, mind-bending exchanges, but they were few and far between.On a positive note, the acting is absolutely stellar. Robert J. Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) and Edward Teller (Benny Safdie) were unbelievable and authentic performances the likes of which we have NEVER seen on screen.Visually, it's still a Nolan film, so you can expect some stunning cinematography and breathtaking shots. The attention to detail is, as always, on point, making the experience a treat for the eyes and ears.Without a doubt, the 70mm used to make this movie makes you feel like you're back in 1945.In the end, ""Oppenheimer"" might not be the Nolan mind-bender we've come to expect, but it does offer a sincere and more grounded look at the life of a historical figure who changed the f*cking world.If you're expecting twisty narratives and jaw-dropping moments (apart from a couple of scenes), you might leave the theater feeling a tad disappointed.Still, you cannot miss seeing this in the cinema. Even if it's not entirely up to his usual mind-blowing standards.Bravo again, Sir Christoper Nolan."
"Oppenheimer is a one-of-a-kind film, a brilliant blend of a biography, a drama and a war film.The film is perfectly made, through the narration of Oppenheimer's prehistory, with the constant changes to the present, the epic music, which in any case fits perfectly with the story told. The highlight of the film, the Manhattan Project, is better executed than anything before, the moment when the atomic bomb explodes, the cinema hall is illuminated.And then nothing. Silence. Until the sound brings the explosion with it. The scenes in the courtroom when Oppenheimer is accused of being considered a communist. When he is defended by his wife and friends, and you keep seeing scenes from the past, with the perfectly acknowledged music. Just wow. The final scenes, when Oppenheimer talks to Einstein at the pond about the possible chain reaction, will be considered one of the best plots of all time. The visions he created shortly before the film ends and the cinema screen goes dark are incredibly well realized and stayed in my head for days afterwards.The cast was perfect, everyone embodied their role incredibly. A film that will stay in your memory forever!!!"
"Oppeneheimer is a very bond, brilliant and important movie. This film is very important from a technical point of view because it introduces a completely new format in cinema (KODAK b&w). The way this story is told is unique, but also very interesting. Actually, the story of Oppenheimer had to be told exactly like that. With a fantastic cast, this film takes us on an unforgettable historical experience that we all need to be familiar with. The mention of world famous scientists is presented very carefully and somewhat moderately (Einstein, Heisenberg, Bhor and of course Oppenheimer), which is the essence of this story.,,I believe we did it."""
"Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer,' deserves all the praise that it gets. It's a Nolan film and you get more than what you had paid for. The movie despite its 3 hour runtime doesn't fail to keep me engaged, however if you are the typical average audience then I can see how you would manage to be bored throughout the movie. The movie was super realistic and makes me appreciate Cillian Murphy as an actor. I have to say - the cast is wonderful and Nolan really knows how to put them to work. Throughout the film there were times I would get tremendously sweaty, so nervous that I would firmly grasp the side of my seat. The movie is a masterpiece and the best bibliographical movie I've ever seen."
"Movie skillfully combines the elements of action, audio, acting, direction, and scene design into an unforgettable cinematic experience.This historical drama, directed by the brilliant Christopher Nolan, weaves a mesmerizing narrative that delves deep into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist whose work changed the course of history during World War II.From the moment the film begins, the audience is transported back in time to the tumultuous era of the 1940s, and Nolan's impeccable attention to detail immerses us into the historical setting effortlessly. The cinematography is awe-inspiring, and the breathtaking landscapes blend seamlessly with the authentic period settings, bringing Oppenheimer's world to life.Each actor brings depth and authenticity to their characters. Cillian Murphy shines in the lead role, delivering a captivating portrayal of a conflicted hero torn between duty and personal struggles. The supporting cast, including Robert Downey Jr. And Emily Blunt and Matt Damon and others, deliver standout performances that contribute to the emotional resonance of the narrative. The chemistry among the cast members is palpable, adding further layers to the film's storytelling.Christopher Nolan's direction is, without a doubt, a work of art. His ability to interweave historical events with human emotions and philosophical musings is nothing short of genius. He masterfully guides the audience through a rollercoaster of emotions, leaving us contemplating the consequences of our actions long after the credits roll.It is an absolute must-watch for cinema enthusiasts and an enduring testament to Nolan's lasting impact on the world of film."
"I had great expectations when I went to the movie. When I left the movie, all my expectations were met. We can say that it is nolan's best movie.Murpy once again performed a great acting and the film, albeit silently, explained the flood that broke inside Oppenheimer very well. The fact that the cast is perfect, it is in different dates, and most importantly, when it is colored, the black and white screen from the eyes of Oppenheimer and the third person view, it is also wonderfully processed.Let's come to the bad side, the person who wants to watch this movie can definitely watch it in a cinema with Imax, I think there will be no same effect in a place without Imax."
"This is Christopher Nolan's first biopic and he has successfully maintained his directional style and made it watchable.Technically, every aspect of filmmaking is good. As it's a biopic I wasn't expecting dramatic twists and traits as we know Christopher Nolan to input them with layers of scientific or scholaric knowledge. And I'm glad he didn't try.But I couldn't loved the movie as much as I tried hard to. It's just one time watchable. I can still watch movies like Inception, Interstellar, Prestige etc. Even after watching more than 10 times not just because of twists but characters insights which lacked in Oppenheimer. I just felt empty when the movie ended.I had went with a friend to watch Oppenheimer and when we were leaving the cinema hall, I tried hard to talk about the film but I couldn't."
"I'm gutted. Genuinely gutted!! I couldn't wait for this to come out in a year of dross cinema!!! I KNEW I shouldn't have trusted the fanboy reviews. ""Oooo, Nolan is a master!!"" ""Best film ever made!!"" Absolute BS!!!!! This is utter garbage!!! 3 hrs of talking and nothing happening!!!!! Usual Nolan music score drowning out dialogue. 2 minutes to show an atomic explosion which was just a fireball in slo-mo. I have never been so bored in my life. The acting was ok and I'm sure it will win a million Oscar's. I KNEW I should have gone to see Barbie instead of this utter waste of time and talent!!!!"
"Oppenheimer is worth the hype especially if you watch it in IMAX. It's the best biopic to date, Nolan really shows his excellent interpretation through his direction and all supporting actors truly deliver. In true Nolan fashion his thought are dispersed in a way where in the end it leaves you satisfied as it is cohesive and thought provoking. His interpretation of the character is amazing. The way he combines physics, philosophy and politics is mesmerising.RDJ character Lewis Strauss is a standout in my opinion, a man who is conservative. Whereas, J Robert Oppenheimer is a man who is depicted as morally conflicted and the emotions of the character are excellent displayed by Murphy.LET NOLAN COOK."
"I don't feel fully equipped to review Oppenheimer. I don't know if I was fully equipped to see it. Is seeing even the right term? I was snapped up by it, tossed about by it, brought to tears by it, left shaken by it.First some context: I drove 2.5 hrs to see it in IMAX 70mm today.The first minute or two made my jaw drop and moved me to tears. I wish more films would be made in start-to-finish analog IMAX because I've never in my life seen such beautiful imagery for a movie. (Shout out to our projectionist who assembled the 600lb print out of the five sections shipped to the theater). I saw Oppenheimer described as a film centered about the human face and that's an apt description. Every moment of IMAX footage is a visual joy, and the way it captures the face is splendid.Oppenheimer is long fast movie. It was a massive amount to take in, and honestly much of it after Trinity blurs together a bit in my memory, with a few exceptions. Every scene with Einstein stood out, as did the church/hall/gathering scene where Oppenheimer greets a crowd. Some of the pivotal hearing scenes stick out. The last scene of the movie was absolutely chilling. There's so much to digest, to return to. All of it was at least good, and a handful of scenes were the best bits of cinema I've ever seen. For these scenes and in expectation of a repeat viewing where I'll digest more of the '54 hearing scenes better, I venture to give Oppenheimer a full mark of 10/10."
"""Oppenheimer"" is an exceptional cinematic experience that exceeded all my expectations. The plot is captivating, filled with suspense and unexpected twists that keep the audience engaged. The characters are well-developed, and the performances are phenomenal, drawing viewers into their emotional journey. The direction, cinematography, and musical score all contribute to a visually stunning and emotionally resonant film. While a few minor pacing issues exist, they hardly detract from the overall brilliance of ""Oppenheimer."" It's a must-watch for any film enthusiast, earning my enthusiastic rating of 9/10. Bravo to the cast and crew for creating such a profound and memorable movie."
"I just come to say that this masterpiece by Christopher Nolan is worthy of an Oscar
A cast with superstars like Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, and guy's, so many others
The movie portrays the CREATION OF THE ATOMIC BOMB, during the second world war
Don't go expecting fight scenes, but a lot of history and physics. There are 3 hours of movie,and I confess that I was scared of being bored, but the film holds you from the first to the last second!It's exciting to see behind the events, I had goosebumps almost the entire movie
IMPORTANT to highlight that it is a movie that it's worthwhile watching in the theaters, the sound of the bomb being exploded is astonishing , nothing compared to real life obviously, but astonishing.An important note: the color scenes are Oppenheimer's subjective experiences, that is, his point of view, and the black and white scenes are objective, the facts seen as a whole.PEOPLE, if you are even a little interested, WATCH IT!"
"THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME, AFTER I WATCHED THIS MOVIE I HONESTLY FELT LIKE IT ONLY LASTED A HOUR OR A FEW MINUTES. THE CINEMATOGRAPHY AND SOUND MADE THIS MOVIE FEEL LIKE A ART PIECE, NOT PICASSO, NOT DA VINCI, NOT MICHELANGELO BUT ALL OF THEM COMBINED. THIS MOVIE MADE ME WANT TO BECOME A PHYSICIST AND COMPLETELY REVAMP ALL OF THE PHYSICS. THIS MOVIE IS HONESTLY BETTER THAN THE NR 1 MOVIE ABOUT THE PRISONER. AFTER WATCHING THIS MOVIE I JUST NEED TO SAY IT IS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN IN MY LIFE, IT DEALS WITH MORALS, DEATH, WAR AND GUILT. I HONESTLY FEELT ANGRY AND SAD FOR OPPENHEIMER SEEING AS HES RESPOSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS OF AT LEAST 220,000 PEOPLE, BUT I ALSO FEEL ANGRY THAT HE BUILDT A WEAPON OF MASS DESTROUCTION."
"Movie is great and all thanks to Christopher Nolan but the plot is very confusing and the pacing isn't in chronological order. The characters are also very confusing because of how plentiful they are. I had to do some research after watching the movie so that I could fully understand it, but I still can't connect the characters and I am missing a big part of the storyline.On the positive side, the explosions are great, the quality and everything is superb and it's one of the best movies I have seen in a minute. Definitely worth watching if you got 3 hours to spare. Might be a long movie and gets boring at times but you won't regret it."
"Can't say much. You get immersed in the world and atmosphere Christopher Nolan builds, and with the ending this film leaves a deep impact on you. Words fall short for Nolan's brilliance, ""masterpiece"" would be an understatement. To me it's Nolan's best film, even better than Interstellar. It isn't just about the atom bomb. It's a deep dive within its creator's character and life. It is Nolan's most emotional and impactful film. He has covered so many aspects and genres of life in one biopic. All the actors have done absolutely top level acting, especially Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr who shine in their roles. This is probably the best biopic we have seen in a long time!"
"It discusses important questions that float in our heads , or those who wonder about how did the world get to this point
It explains how it happened how humanity is it's own first enemy , if it's curiosity, rise to power or whatever it's , if we don't consider what's coming we will unleash destruction , devastation
the acting on of each an every actor is almost the best in each of their careers
they are committed and emerged and will take you inside Oppenheimer's head and the chaotic story about science vs politics vs just being decent human beings
the soundtrack and sound effects are immersive ,you are not just travel there , you experience what's in the character's head and the pressure and how they see things
and the final quote , it's there to stay and defines the stage we are at as human race."

"Good premise and strong message, but 100 jump cuts and strung out character interviews unfortunately jade the explosive nature of the movie. Great biopic story build-up and general pace for the race against the Nazis and development of the atomic bomb. An allstar cast combined with some great cinematography helped show off modern day movie making capability. However, the last 1/3 of the movie was almost a waste of time, with the exception of the carrot stick Einstein ending. My partner genuinely fell asleep on my shoulder, during the endless questioning of every character in this movie, about what they thought of openhiemer and his connection to communism... Yawn. Many hidden layers and messages in this film which I enjoyed. Many hidden character hidden motives come to light which were mildy interesting. Score was ok.. Although there is no epic tune sticking my head, unlike interstellar or moon for example. Overall I think this movie is a bit overhyped, with people heavily praising Christopher Nolan without justification, definitely not his best work. Cillian Murphy does give a stellar performance... But there's only so many scenes I can take of him staring off-center in conflicting thought. It gets a bit repetitive and 3 hours seemed uneccessary for this story. Overall a good watch if you have interest in the creation of nuclear weapons and particularly the 'opi' man himself. Leave the cinema halfway if you don't enjoy politics and interviews and comi bashing. 6/10."
"I really wanted to see this movie and saw it on the big screen. I was trying to figure out what was wrong with this movie to whole time while I was watching it. Even after the first 40 minutes I had no idea where this was going. The storyline was so disjointed, bouncing back and forth in time sequences. This created a real lack of continuity in the telling of the tale. There was a potentially great story to tell here, but it just seemed like a huge pity play for those sucked into the communist theology and what a god awful marriage his wife endured. Nolan missed the whole story. Really blew it on this one, sorry to say."
"Like most Nolan movies, the writing and cinematography are wonderful. It's a powerful story, that deserves to be told by someone who translate it to the big screen.But, there are some things that are definitely different about this particular Nolan film:1) The sex scenes are awkward and add literally nothing to the film. No spoilers, but if you have younger kids you'll want to research when these are and prepare. Nolan will hopefully go back to not including these scenes for the next 20 years.2) The soundtrack was not typical - at times it was unbelievably loud, almost jarring. I understand this topic is different than most Nolan movies, but even so, you not play have music that isn't a distraction. I'd say this was.I would say, the acting was phenomenal - all around."
"I may consider myself as a lucky man to live at mr. Christopher Nolan's time , the movie is totally a masterpiece in many sections as direction , acting , photography and casting , very rare in our time to see such a great movie as this one with no doubt this is the greatest I've ever seeen
You can take any frame from this movie and put it in a museum and people will think that it is a great drawing by a famous artist
cilian murphy is definitely going for an oscar for this role robert downey jr. Is doing aswell Rami malek who didn't appear in many scenes but each one is not easy to forget
I think Nolan also is going for an oscar too but we don't know what we will see in dicaprio's next movie."

"Just came from the theatre and felt compelled to write a review for the first time in my life.To say that Nolans ""Oppenheimer"" is a suspenseful film would be a massive understatement! Never in my life would I have thought that I would feel such anxiety and excitement for more then an hour over a movie.The suspension reaches a peak half an hour before the Trinity test and stays there for the rest of the movie. It feels as if you were there yourself waiting for the detonation of a bomb that is powerful beyond your comprehension!Even after the bomb goes of, the tension is still there only now fuled by Oppenheimers personal drama and fight for his legacy and reputation. That is the moment where Nolan shines as a film director. His command over the emotional state of the viewers is mind blowing.The movie is beautiful and the practical effects are out of this world, showing once again that CGI is not only overrated but also overused.The cast and acting is fantastic. Everyone just killed it!This movie is like an emotional rollercoaster that only goes up and up, building tension, anxiety, making your heart pound faster and faster only to never give you proper relief nor real closure - and not at all in a bad way but in a way true to the real life events and people that participated in the Manhattan project.Thought provoking, anxiety fuled, beautiful and exiting masterpiece!"
"The film makes you feel the atmosphere of the cinema, it entertains you not only visually, but also audibly from the great soundtracks present in it, and + the film tells you one of the greatest stories in history that changed the world, and also the performance of a mighty acting from all the crew, especially Cillian Murphy, the hero of the film. The role was created for him because he Quarrels and feelings are not great acting, but even his looks. Also, director Christopher Nolan was one of the best directors in history. He did not tell you the story of the world, Oppen Heimer, with a correct time line, but rather manipulated time so that the viewer does not feel bored while witnessing this masterpiece. This movie is a great movie, and it deserves to get many awards this year, and it deserves to be watched more than once or twice."
"Incredible, riveting an ode to film making, to story telling.Please go to see it on the big screen!!Nolan can make Matt Damon to act, Rober Downy JR to suck the life from the theater and Florence Pugh, don't make me start about Florence.Nolan is one of the last creators,
With the advent of AI, maybe this is the last ""FILM"" to be ever made!It is more like a theater. The Trinity event is impresive, but the last scene in the commission room is the main event of the film, Nolan can put the entire History of the World in one small chamber, in a bureaucratic procedure.Thank you Mister Regizor fot this regal for the mind and soul!"
"This movie was absolutely breathtaking. I don't typically like history movies all that much but the perfect level of action, excitement. This movie had me literally at the edge of my seat. Murphy played this roll so beyond well and I am not surprised, he is the only reason I watched this and man did he deliver. If he doesn't win an award for this movie I'll start a riot. Robert was incredible, I was not expecting for such a twist and such a debate. The only downside was Florence's nude scenes, honestly they were unnecessary, I could have watched this movie perfectly fine without seeing someone's chest or bare ass."
"I will say I was waiting a long time for this to finally hit theaters and I was not dissappointed. Let's start with the slight negatives I have about this movie. The story seemed to drag a little bit, on top of it being 3 hours long. It is really slow paced, slower than I would of liked. The good thing I would say is that the story itself is very intriguing and grasping. That is what made it better.The second thing I would say is that there was too much time spent on the drama portion rather than actually seeing everyone come together to accomplish the goal. There was very little screen time showing how everyone worked together and even missing just a few small things about how they came up with all the equations for Fission/Fusion. For example.Those are my minor personal gripes with the movie. On the other hand, the acting, plot, and everything else was accurate and entertaining to watch. Oppenheimer is the best movie I've seen in the past 2 years. This isn't a movie I would watch every year, but I would definitely watch plenty of times over my lifetime. I would give it a soft 8.5/10 and a solid 8."
"Had always been a fan of Nolan's works, but Oppenheimer certainly is not one of them. Here are my reasons.First of all, the editing is a huge mess. Unnecessarily overcomplicated and rushed. The movie brushes through scenes like it's browsing on Tiktok, and jumps around different timelines like it has ADHD. What's worse is that a lot of these mini scenes are pretty much pointless fillers, serving no purpose whatsoever.Second, they throw in new characters every few minutes and fail to develop almost any of them. Despite the great acting, they still feel dull and abundant. By the end of the movie, I couldn't recognize half of the cast nor do I care much about them.Most importantly, does it have to be THIS LONG? The first half of the events are simply unnecessary and uninteresting. The length could have been cut down by an hour and nothing will be lost. I understand Nolan wants to include Oppenheimer's private life as well as events that impacted him prior/post the Manhattan project. However most of these are at very surface level, as the movie tries to run through so many different storylines and yet didn't really focus on and dive into any of them. It wasn't as thought provoking or emotion evoking as it tries to be, instead it becomes a tedious mess with so much happening but nothing much to take away from.I have to make it clear though, despite my rant, I don't think this is a bad movie. I think the scenes are well shot and directed. The cinematography and acting is undoubtedly top tier. I like the visuals and sound effects, and certainly enjoyed the second half way more than the first.That being said, this is still quite a let down as I had a lot of expectation for this one. Although this could be the type of movie that you'd enjoy more on a second watch (given more context), I 100% will not spend another 3hrs on this ever again."
"Not sure the hype around Oppenheimer. I am a fan of Nolan but his storytelling is somewhat strange. Timeline never flows properly and the movie likes to jump all around.I like Dunkirk, I love Batman Dark Knight Trilogy, I thought Inception was thought provoking as well as Interstellar but his last film Tenet and this one was just utterly bad storytelling.There are many parts to like, the great music the odd and weird way we get to feel inside Oppenheimer's head but for the most part the movie was just too long and narrative was all over the place.There is story about his youth, story about his Manhattan project, story about his politics, story about his trial to remove his status and finally a story about a political rival ann maybe even a story about his lover. If you could of rearrange and stop jumping around this movie would of been better for me."
"I'm not the fan type. I know that many people like the film because it projects their inner fear, while we get to know the man and the one who wanted to disable him. I also know that a knife can kill people and slice bread, it just depends on the user. I also know that the younger generation, who are only living in the current heightened political situation, are full of emotion and passion.The film makes it clear that physics and chemistry are not interested in the human belief system, nuclear fusions have no emotion, merely chemical reaction.However, the work could have highlighted the fact that, as RD jr. The personal emotions and past grievances of the leaders of the countries on a global level lead to major disasters. These must be prevented at all costs.(Robert Downey Jr. Deserves an Oscar.)"
"I went to the cinema without hope, i saw the trailer 1 week before and i felt a weird feeling because i was waiting another movie. Decided to see the movie because is directed by Cristopher Nolan and i love his movies never dissapointed me (Except Dunkerke).When i finally see de movie i couldn´t stop smiling and asking me what i saw. I went with my brother and my friend, we were in suprised with this movie. The actuation specially of Murphy was absolutly brilliant for ours more than Robert Downey Jr.Conclusion: Nolan has a crazy but smart brain and it´s impossible to let your down (Except with Dunkerke movie).Congratulations Cristopher Nolan."
"It is unfair to write a review and evaluation of Oppenheimer's film, it is like someone coming to you and trying to explain the greatness of what Ronaldo did in 2019 The comeback, the topic is too great to be described with mere words, you must see it in order to feel its greatness.Sohaib é o melhor crítico de cinema da história..
It is unfair to write a review and evaluation of Oppenheimer's film, it is like someone coming to you and trying to explain the greatness of what Ronaldo did in 2019 The comeback, the topic is too great to be described with mere words, you must see it in order to feel its greatness......"
"Cutting to the chase, I did not know how this would turn out. The media was hyping it up. After watching it, I was speechless. The music is a masterpiece, cinematography is amazing, acting is so strong.The movie makes you go through a roller coaster of emotions. The only drawback is the runtime, with can sometimes become repetitive however nothing took me out of the loop, it was interesting enough and had twists.Well worth it. Everything was building up to that one atomic and boy did it deliver. Cilian did amazing as Oppenheimer, brought his character to the very depths of all the emotions."
"The reality is that the story captured was not to show people getting blown up or some sort of reenactment of the devastation to Hiroshima and Nagasaki. If that's what you were searching for, first seek professional help. Second, this movie is not for you.If you are looking for a gloss over of powerful and thought provoking historical information and instead a display of 3 hours worth of explosion demonstrations, I encourage YouTube. This movie is not for you.This movie is gripping. The actors so clearly dedicated themselves to portraying a story built on humanity. Humanity is mundane and introspective, as is this movie. If you are searching for some over dramatized and tacky retelling of a prominent historical event, then this movie is just not for you.The reviews on here are interesting but they speak to what Nolan was after in the theme of the movie. Humans are capable of such a lack of humanity and decency unless it's met at their own front door. Ask yourself if what you're searching for in this movie even makes sense before you watch it or judge it.P. S. There can be no spoilers because all of this happened over 50 years ago. So the complaints of spoilers makes me laugh!"
"Oppenheimer is not like any other Movies of Nolan.. It doesn't have a mind boggling script or outrageous Scientific Theories (well subjective) that is because it's a Biopic. It is not going to show what already hasn't happened . For me the best thing a biopic or historical piece could do is to potray it good enough so that most of the people watching it gets the idea of it. With Oppenheimer it was outstanding even the thin linners which most us (who watched) ignored were also very powerful and has their own impact in a way. The detailing were flawless (On point).I see most of the people complaining about it being slow or something.. Well It's not a thriller like other Nolan Movies ( I don't know what you expected) so ofc it won't have things like car flying or bullet firing every second. It's a great Biopic with everything what a movie should have.I personally would suggest any of you planning to watch is to listen to the convos very carefully all of them hold a great bit of information to them and will contribute alot at the end(Some of them conversations between this great people is absolutely astonishing and also the ACT, amazing).This was a different type of movie from what Nolan had made before (for me). Everything was focused around Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) and all of them casts did an amazing job to it too.This was a great Watch for me(Every Time I think about it I get amazed by it)."
"Another deep dive into Nolan's cinematic mind which at this point must be regarded as one of the best of all time.The film is 3 hours of pure cinema, paced to perfection, leaving the viewer on the edge of their seat for the movie's entirety.The movie provides two different perspectives with the black and white scenes symbolising the publics and mainly the governments views on dr Oppenheimer as they begin to investigate the leaking of information on the development of the bomb to the soviets.The colours scenes represent Oppenheimers first hand accounts. Starting with him being a humble student in the beginning right the way through to the bone chilling final chapter where the weight and guilt of Nagasaki and Hiroshima open Oppenheimers eyes to a scary future in which he has helped craft."
"Everything in this film was amazing. I watched this film in 70mm IMAX and loved every single second of it. My opinion may be biased because I love Christopher Nolan's work as well as the work of many of the actors in this film. It is very historically accurate, people complain about sound in Nolan films but I don't have a single complaint about the sound for this one. The way this film is structured may confuse many people, there are a lot of cuts in the beginning and end but it is not made too difficult to understand. I watched this with a friend that had nearly no knowledge of Oppenheimer other than his greatest achievement of course and he understood basically everything in this film. The entire cast did a brilliant job, especially Cillian Murphy. It's also great to see Robert Downey Jr. Actually push himself and reaffirm his talent. I cannot recommend this film enough to anyone. Everything is done perfectly."
"I love Christopher Nolan, Inception might be my favorite movie of all time. But honestly this was just kinda boring and I wasn't super interested in the story. My roommate loved it but I miss when Nolan was doing more interesting fiction.There was far less of the after effects of the bombing shown than I expected, and I was overall disappointed with how low budget this film seemed. I miss the action or at least interest and supernatural intensity and wonder Nolan has accomplished alongside the intellectual rollercoaster in his 2010's films. This was just kind of a documentary, gave me similar vibes to that McDonald's Founder film or First Man, though without any of the action First Man had. Not that I can't appreciate a movie without action, that's just something I miss how Nolan does, and was overall just bored with this movie."
"Cillian did well, but it wasn't a groundbreaking performance. It was his normal character minus a little of his edginess that he always plays. He did well, but nothing extraordinary. The plot was interesting until Oppy's sabotage plot because it left facts and dove healing into speculative history, and, forgive me, I'm not a communist sympathizer and wound up walking out due to the love and perfection ceremony for communism... the right kind, not the soviet kind that's actually bad... because there's a difference, right? The actual explosion could've been epic, but, in imax, it fell short. I liked the first half of the movie, but it wasn't great. As a history major and buff it was good, but definitely not an 8. Especially if you like facts."
"It's 3 hours long yet it felt like time flew, couldn't take my eyes off and didn't even leave my seat. The cinematography, the acting and dialogues. Top notch! I think it finished before, they should've mentioned his death and how he spent his life after all the controversy and the trial and how he was as a kid. The explosion seen left the theatre mesmerized.It's 3 hours long yet it felt like time flew, couldn't take my eyes off and didn't even leave my seat. The cinematography, the acting and dialogues.

The explosion seen left the theatre mesmerized."
"Christopher Nolan's latest addition to his already impressive repertoire, is a tale about a famous figure that is haunted by what the future might hold after having made crucial decisions that changed the world forever, and the movie isn't about events that took place at certain times, but it is about the man that was responsible for them; Julius Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb.The most impressive thing about Oppenheimer is that it has all the makings of a boring movie, and a lesser experienced director might have deviated from the core of the movie. For instance, the movie is three hours long, and it's mostly shot in rooms where people are having discussions; in many ways the explosives were in the back seat for the whole movie, and one might argue that it's for the better.This movie is a cinematic experience that can only be described as a masterpiece, and we see the whole journey that Oppe had taken during world war 2.Cillian Murphy gave an Oscar winning performance and the performance of a lifetime for him, and we all think that it's been long overdue as he waited for a moment like this his whole career and finally got the best of the best.All in all, we need to be very focused and ready as the movie moves very fast in the first hour, and finally it's definitely a top three movie for Nolan."
"First off, a masterclass performance by Cillian Murphy. He emphatically captured the personality behind the first atomic bomb and ""The Father of The Atomic Bomb"". The film delivered on all fronts from Christopher Nolan and gave a great historical overview on Oppenheimer and how he came about the Manhattan Project. The film could have focused more on the war and less about the communist associations of his earlier life. But the film still was incredibly well written, directed and choreographed.At the end of the day, I hope most people realize the frightening power of nuclear energy. No victor will and can be declared in nuclear warfare, the only victor is the dead."
The film is extremly good. Although the movie is 3 hours long you won't get bored. The story is told in a great way and the actors are perfectly choosen. Of course the performance of the actors were also incredibile. The countryside was also well choosen. The camera movement and the switches between black and white and colour makes the movie way more exciting and realistic. Also the clean and thoughtful cuts let the film be very philosophic. Honestly at the end you are mindblown and it all makes sense. Because the film is so philosophic you have to think about it after the film ended. All in all a great movie.
I am a film enjoyed and I have seen many films and honesty I can say without a doubt in my mind Oppenheimer is the best motion picture I have ever seen from its breath taking cinematography to its incredible story telling its quite literally perfection.You may be thinking its only for people who enjoy and know a lot about science but it's not the case while yes their may be the odd term the average person might be unfamiliar with it is soon explained well and in detail but I will say it will certainly be more enjoyable to someone who knows a bit about science and enjoys films.You may also be thinking I would rather watch barbie well to that I say more fool you I have seen both and I can say without a doubt in my mind oppenheimer is better in every way shape or form.If you haven't seen it don't walk run to your nearest cinema and purchase a ticket you will not regret it I can guarantee it.
"From the very beginning to the absolute last moment of this masterpiece, you will be completely captivated in all facets of the word. Oppenheimer shows that Christopher Nolan is a mastermind of cinematography and he fails to disappoint yet again.I have never witnessed a film that has been so beautiful yet disturbing at the same time. The visual effects I saw on screen and the wicked audio that shook the ground below at times have been unmatched by anything else I have witnessed. Combine this with a story that will keep you on your heels through the entire three hour duration that this movie holds and it is absolutely worthwhile for anybody and everybody to see.I'd like to use this review to also point out the impeccable performances so many actors in this film put on and will almost certainly be used as defining moments in their careers: Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, Rami Malek, Josh Harnett, Gary Oldman, etc.,"
"Oppenheimer is an absolute triumph in the world of cinema, leaving a lasting impression with its powerful storytelling and exceptional performances. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer is nothing short of mesmerizing. He flawlessly captures the physicist's brilliance, inner conflicts, and transformation throughout the film. Robert Downey Jr., in a supporting role, delivers a compelling performance, showcasing his versatility as an actor.The film's musical score, composed by a maestro, complements the narrative beautifully. It weaves a tapestry of emotions, heightening the tension and drama of pivotal moments. The music becomes an integral part of the movie, guiding viewers through Oppenheimer's journey and adding layers of depth to the storytelling.Overall, Oppenheimer is a tour de force, tackling complex themes of ambition, ethics, and the human cost of scientific progress. The direction is masterful, deftly balancing the scientific discoveries with the personal struggles of its characters. The film's narrative arc keeps viewers engaged from start to finish, evoking a wide range of emotions."
"Wow, just wow. Christopher Nolan came back to film with one of the greatest examples of storytelling ever. Even though Oppenheimer is a biopic, Nolan still manages to deliver a beautifully crafted story about a complex and morally gray genius. Though I believe this was a little too dense and could have been shortened up or made into two different movies, it still manages to keep your attention throughout your viewing. Nolans style is at its absolute peak and creatively intelligent. Along with beautiful writing, comes an expertly assembled cast. Cillian Murphy absolutely brought everything he had to this role and it shows. Robert Downey Jr. Finally gets to show his immense talent and range. Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh give convincing emotional performances and really embody their characters. Every actor is absolutely spectacular, and it enhances the movie so much. Cinematography has always been a key part of Nolans films, but this movie's visuals are utterly stunning. The camera work and practical effects leave you with a sense of dread and fear of what Oppenheimer created, but that's also thanks to the intense audio mixing. All in all, Nolan has made the film of the year. He has shown that a movie doesn't tell just a situation, but an actual story. Oscar worthy is an understatement."
"As usual Nolan had directed this movie in multiple timelines and also using black and white effect. Story of scientist said by sound effects. I heard in marketing event Nolan boasting about no VFX but only to makeup with the sound effects.Definitely not that great as inception and interstellar. Murphy, daemon, Robert were amazing and really blended well into their roles. If you compare with Chernobyl it's not that great. Gravity is not kept throughout the movie and it's tried to hype with bringing names of very renowned scientists! Could have been directed in better way considering the star cast of movie.."
"I respect Nolan's craft but I am not a fan.I was left a bit bemused with the decisions that Nolan has taken as a director for this film. The entire first half the audience is made to invest emotionally in the making of the A-bomb. Because of the nature of the storytelling showing the film from the point of view of Oppenheimer, it is a natural way of making the audience root for the main character. Understood. Accepted.The second half goes in establishing that Oppenheimer was a true patriot. He is even decorated for his contribution.But what about the aftermath?Yes there are mentions here and there. But there is no visible remorse. Nor in his actions it is clear. It is as if there is no accountability in the man. That is what baffled me the most. Was it the plan to hang it in the middle and allow the audience to choose how they see it fit? If yes then why tell the story from Oppenheimer's pov? Why make the audience connect with the man? The emotional investment in the main character only to be left wondering in the end as to why Nolan chose to leave it this way?This may have worked for every other person but sadly it has not worked for me.There is nothing great that we have not already seen in a Nolan film. The acting overall is good. Clearly the studio backed Nolan very well, so well that the film has prominent actors even in short cameos.It's 5/10 for me as the movie, for me, fails at a human level. The film has no soul."
"Nolan has done it again as he tells a tight and amazing story matched with great visuals, cinematography, and score while leaving you deeply connecting with the theme of the film. I left the theatre today not to claps or conversation but it was silent, and the reason I was silent is because diving into that story and the mind of Oppenheimer it really shows how complex of a time it was and leaves you in a grey area, up to your interpretation. I've always view nuclear bombs as the destroyer of worlds as Oppenheimer puts it, yet it has led to the longest relative peace time that we have seen.Along side with the free existential crisis, Oppenheimer also delivered with amazing performances from Murphy, Downey Jr. And blunt. Watching these three well known actors I didn't even notice them, I was totally lost in 1940 with them being able to feel everything they felt truly great performances.These are the type of films I miss from Hollywood, something that challenges the viewer something that was made with a clear vision that was done how it was meant to be done, a director and it's cast with no big wig effecting the production."
"The most important part of this film, in my opinion, is the parallel between Oppenheimer and the myth of Prometheus and his sins, the missing part of this mythical story is the liberation of Prometheus by a titan who, seeing his innocence in his attempt to deliver fire and revelation to mankind, unlocks his chains.Oppenheimer receives no such redemption, for when he seeks it he is treated as a coward, a crybaby and a weakling, and is even accused of his sentences. The only thing he received is public oblivion, that his deeds are not forgiven, but are demeaned of severity and damage, as Einstein tells him in one of his final conversations, all applauding and commemorating him, regardless of his obvious sins."
"Before I watched the film I was exposed to a few not-so-positive reviews, and my high hopes got replaced by a small preparation of being let down. I couldn't have been more wrong though.The fast paced dialogue, the music, the almost psychedelic visuals and the stellar performance of some amazing actors formed a mixture which held my attention for the full three hours.The chaos and pace of several scenes conveyed the story of political pressure of the time insanely well, and for me the last part of the film portrayed the 'catching-up' of ethics and realisation amazingly.The story of this time is also a very important testimony of how science has been manipulated to function politics, something highly relevant in the world we live in today."
"Im an avrage movie watcher and i rate every movie a good one, but this actually changed my point of view about good movies.This is a pure masterpiece. The movie is so well made and everything is very enjoyable, the emotions of the actors and everything was on point. Murphy did a wonderful job but lets not forget about Downey jr. And Jason Clarke who gave such intense emotions which made me very curious about what will happend next. The fx were incredible and everything seemed so realistic you could'nt tell if it was real or computer made. I encourage watching it on a 70 mm imax for the best experience but even a simple cinema will get the standards high. Congrats to Christian Nolan and to everyone from the production."
I won't waste.. It's an epic movie.. From all Chris movies.. 3 hours went so deep inside.. I would love to see and watch it again. Time with nolen is definitely there in this epic movie.. Its for history.. Flash back.. Black and color moments bringing an extra advantage to the movie.. I prefer watching it in imax.. Soundtrack was amazing and wonderful.. Go watch it now and believe me its worth it movie like oppenheimer.. With all my respect for those who gave 7 or 8 out of 10.. I will give it 9 at least.. In Gulf dubai Kuwait and doha and oman ksa is sold out very fast.. Even mission impossible was not like that.
"Amazing movie, I never expected it to go to the political aide of things back then. The movie was as accurate as possible.

"Honestly amazing cast. If cillian murphy doesn't get best actor i'm gonna riot. Also the visual effects are so good (especially during the opening sequence and the cambridge dreams). Also einstein is such a cutie patootie i love him so much i want to shrink him and put him in my pocket tbh he was so adorable. Also they brushed over the fact that oppy tried to kill his teacher a bit too much for my liking but ig its not my movie... anyway i just want to thank the hairstylists for giving cillian murphy curly hair as a gangly 20 year old i really appreciate it beyond words tysm chrissy. Anyway jean deserved better tbh she was such a girlboss slay queen and they turned her into a sex object which i did not appreciate #justice4jean anyway the casting was sooo so good like it felt like that bit in animal farm where the animals look from the pigs to the men and back again and they can't tell the difference yeah it was like that. Anyway speaking of casting can nolan pls stop casting cillian murphy in really traumatised roles. Leave that poor man alone his thousand yard stare is getting a bit too realistic for my liking tbh #savecillian2023 OMG have u guys seen that video at the premiere where matt damon accidentally bumped into cillian murphy and cilly turned and gave the camera the most pained expression i have ever seen its so funny. ALSO. The costuming in the movie was sooo good i recently found out that oppy's (cool way of saying oppenheimer) costumes were inspired by david bowie which explains why he looked so absolutely snatched in that one scene in los alamos anyway i read a really sad article where emily blunt said that poor little cillian murphy only ate one almond a day (heartbroken emoji) #yolandahadidcore anyway that one scene on the train where his shoulders looked really small and his head looked really big. Yeah. Anyway. Im sure everyone is waiting for me to talk about the sex scenes. Well i am. ""now i am become death destroyer of worlds"" why did she make him read that while she was. U know. Also the hearing scene was so awkward because they were talking about jean and then the camera panned around that one guy and i KNEW oppy was gonna be naked when the camera panned back around and he was and also cillian murphy has so many freckles ANYWAY not the point but it was so awkward because florence pugh was just staring at emily blunt with the most (REDACTED)-out expression it was so awkward. Anyway. Speaking of emily blunt she absolutely DEVOURED that roger guy. ""16, 17, no, 18 years"" GIRLLL ATE HIM UP AND LEFT NO CRUMBS. Also the way they were talking about communism like it was worse than/equivalent to facism like stalinism is different to communism girlypop! #readyourtheory #dialecticalmaterialism #uncleanoosh ANYWAY i cant remember the ending of the movie very well because i had spent the last third of the movie absolutely sobbing my eyes out because i was so upset. That brings me to why i deducted two stars is because if you're a bit sensitive like me the movie is actually a bit of a hard watch tbh also it's not the kind of movie i'd watch again... sorry nolan... it's an absolute masterpiece but it really is so emotionally draining. Also don't watch it in a super crowded cinema because i had such a bad headache for days afterwards because i was trying to had not to cry loudly. 0/10 do not recommend anyway. I probably already mentioned this but cillian murphy is such a good actor like his screen presence is so magnetic you just can't help but look at him ALSO the fact that he is sooo so good looking im sorry i know that that's not the point of the movie but gahhdamn that man is fine. Anyway rami malek was a bit of a jumpscare and i thought it was really funny that david hill defended oppy despite oppy always flipping over his clipboard lmao #justicefordavidhill anyway OH MY GOD I ALMOST FORGOT TO TALK ABOUT STRAUSS. Robert downey jr was so good in this movie and tbh i hear some oscar buzz anyway strauss (pronounced ""stross"" be careful out there everyone, i got clowned on for pronouncing it like strauss sad face) is such a silly little guy and also really annoying. ALSO im just now realising that i genuinely have no idea what oppy's hearing was about. Like genuinely no idea. I also missed like a good 10 minutes of dialogue post hiroshima because i was so shell shocked. Don't really ask me what happened after hiroshima because i was seeing the screen through blurry eyes as i was. Slightly emotionally affected by it. Which is a slight understatement. ALSO RODERICK WAS IN IT? He was throwing up outside after oppy's speech and i related to that so hard tbh there was one point where i was so upset i felt like i was going to faint. Probably the most disassociating experience is walking out of oppenheimer feeling nothing short of shell-shocked and walking into an ocean of pink. Jesus i felt like i needed a cigarette. Anyway it was an absolutely amazing movie but wayyy too emotionally draining to warrant another watch so i had to deduct two stars sorry :(( if they released a cut that was just up to the (but not including) the trinity test i would watch that again and again but the last third of the movie is just so harrowing. Maybe i should watch it again in the comfort of my own home just for some sort of catharsis because i feel a lot of pent up emotion about it because you know it isn't exactly deemed socially acceptable to sob and wail in a cinema is it. Maybe it is idk. Anyway i was the only girl in my cinema which made the sex scenes a bit uncomfortable because of the overwhelming masculine energy emanating from my screening but i digress. Also make sure to, if you're a girl/feminine aligned person, wear a super brightly coloured outfit to confuse all the men and make them think you're in the wrong movie it's funny asf. Also im not gonna lie the humour was giving marvel movie which i found really cringy but thats ok ig its not my movie. The script was sooo much better than other nolan films but a good bit of the dialogue was swallowed by the music also why were they mumbling half the time like SPEAK UP MY FRIEND. I needed subtitles i swear anyway i was not a big fan of the way they skimmed over the effects that the trinity test had on the local indigenous groups but what else can u expect from a white director.

"It's a great Christopher Nolan movie and definitely one of if not my favorite movie. However it's not a movie made for everyone. You need to have a good attention span and you have to be interested in it. Even I have to still comprehend it and overthink about it. I saw alot of people who say it is a boring movie and I think the reason is they didn't understand many parts. I think another reason is many people never watched a biography movie and only expect movies where there is a happy ending. Overall if you think you can watch a 3 hour masterpiece that is literally a biography, then watch it."
"Oh lord where to start. Yes it's an hard movie to watch cus boring level is high. Yes still interesting to know more about important history. And I don't think you could make this movie any better to be honest. Great camera work. Great actors, great script. But still boring. Nolan did a great work with what he could and this is a movie that is overhyped but I think it will fall into the shadows after some years. If you have seen tinker tailor soldier spy, we'll that's the feeling I'm getting from this one. Worth wile to watch? Yea ofcourse but still overhyped and boring movie, but I did not feel like it was a waste of time. A solid 7/10."
"I was so hyped to see this movie especially after the first positive reviews on IMDB. My son and I even used the opportunity on our short trip to Hong Kon to watch it as we live in Shanghai and I am bot sure when it will be released in China.The cast is very good yet the movie is plain boring. I fell asleep twice during the first hour. The constant background music was so annoying. It was only talk and very little about the actual bomb making and design. The bomb testing was just plain bad, lile a low budget movie. The remaining hour of the movie was a court drama. I can't believe people liked this crap. My son was waiting for this movie for a long time and asked me twice to walk out."
"I liked the movie, the cast and characters and it was interesting. I don't know enough about the historic events to say if it's a correct reflection. Oppenheimer coping with guilt was wonderfully brought across. Contrast in loud sound and silence was impressive. Worth it to see it on cinema.Oppenheimer was speaking what I recognised as German, but it was explained to be Dutch. As a Dutch native speaker I didn't even recognise it. I am always surprised that in a million dollar budget, these little things that could be easily done right always seem to go wrong.In my opinion the end play was stretched a bit long. It may have been to get the history complete, but the 'plot' was explained at the end anyway. It gave me a bit of a Guy Ritchie feeling, turning the movie into a crime thriller. Making a 3 hour movie seems to be a goal for some directors."
"Saw opening night in 70mm, and now just again with closed captions. I am finishing for a third and final (Trinity) showing again in the 70mm in two weeks. This movie is breathtaking, mind boggling and outright spectacular. Instant favorite up there with interstellar. Nolan is unbeatable..... The cinematography as well as the score was second to none , the supporting cast is like none i've ever seen. You could hire thousand directors and none would be able to replicate what Nolan did here. Common themes of time and relevance scattered , has you on your toes the entire time. If you do not watch this movie, you are simply missing out on one of the best films of all time."
"Nolan leaves no doubt that he can take on truly the most daunting depiction of a man of history and he delivered brilliantly. Not only on par with this other films, but this could go down as one of the great. Ludwig Goransson's score is a 10/10 and the pacing of the film was fantastic. I especially enjoyed the first Act where Oppenheimer was studying. Nolan did an incredible job of giving the audience insight into it psyche and nature.Furthermore, Nolan was able to portray the cataclysmic nature of the bomb without any over-the-top CGI and the horrifying anguish that comes with its use on Japan without even showing the use of it on Japan or the after effects at all. Brilliant."
Recently watched Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer in 70 MM IMAX and was absolutely stunned by the visuals I love every part of this movie. I thought that the whole movie really in bodied Oppenheimer I like the use of no visual effects in this movie it really gives the movie the authentic film experience I think everyone should watch this film. I walked into this movie with no knowledge of Oppenheimer even though I have heard of him I think Oppenheimer didn't get the respect he deserved until this this film. This movie might be in my top 3 I haven't seen such a good movie since interstellar (also one of Nolan's films) I think the three hours flies bye and is enough time to see the life of Robert J. Oppenheimer.
Was concerned for the length of the film but was so gripped the whole time it flew past. A better understanding of history with brilliant acting all the way through. The best film I've seen in a long time. Cillian Murphy needs to win awards for this and I will be shocked if he doesn't. A story that was explained told so it's understandable and very interesting. Finally something brilliant to be shown at the cinemas. The trailers and promotion for this film do not do it justice and I cannot believe the amount of famous faces that kept popping up. 10/10 recommend this to anyone considering going to view it.
"""Oppenheimer"" is not your typical blockbuster!It's a masterful and intelligent film with a relentless pace and a runtime of 3 hours! 📽 It expertly portrays the urgency of the US's pursuit of the atomic bomb. The film's respect for its audience is evident in its dense and layered screenplay, as well as its visually striking cinematography and evocative score. 🎬Though the film's three-hour length can be taxing at times, the overall experience is highly rewarding. It flawlessly captures the essence of the era and the complex figure of Oppenheimer, showcasing both his remarkable achievements and inherent flaws. This is a cinematic achievement at its finest and a definite must-watch, leaving the viewer thoroughly engrossed throughout the entire journey.P.s. Give Cillian Murphy an Oscar!If you're going to the movie theatre, IMAX is the best experience you can find."
"A great biopic with a stacked movie cast! What more can you ask. A lot of clues and relevant links to many things throughout the movie so keep your eyes peeled. Cinematography and some of the mise en scenes were so nice to see. The use of non-diegetic sounds also made this movie, (the chair was literally rocking due to the sound effects, you could feel the sound if that makes sense). What kept this movie from being perfect was the fact that the actual explosion episodes were just a tad underwhelming but that's understandable because the movie isn't just about big explosions. The film actually gives us the insight to what Mr Oppenheimer is holding himself responsible for being the father of the atomic bomb. He's created something that can put an end to the world at once and he has to live with that sense of guilt, it will forever stay. His name will be renowned even after he passes."
"Words can't explain how beautifully crafted this film is. Christopher Nolan just continues to produce mastermind film making. Perfect music score. There was not one moment within the film that I was not truly intrigued. The non linear timeline of the story further builds suspense, which is much needed in a 3 hour film. The acting was absolutely phenomenal and reveals the tension in each scene. The attention to detail with the historical details and physics terminology is further impressive such as the sound from the trinity test occurring a bit after the bomb was detonated. Truly astonished by Nolan's cinematic choices with each film he creates."
"Solid 7.5. Great acting, great visuals, so-so editing. Nice to see Ciliian Murphy getting a leading role. No actor is better at acting w/o saying anything. It's the semi-watering eyes. I'll have to look into all the non-bomb making aspects of his life, I know so little. Didn't know about the commie ties, the losing security clearance (whatever), and all the rest. Ni ce to so many actors having 1-2 lines and doing a great job, I guess they all wanted to be in it. Musta sucked to be a part of making a weapon so powerful, but if they didn't someone else worse woulda. Anyway I'll never put on another life jacket."
"I expected a movie centered around nuclear war and the potential annihilation of the planet to be more captivating, but it just wasn't. Once again Christopher Nolan is semi-redeemed by terrific acting and a great cast, which is perhaps the only redeemable thing about this trash heap of a film. Truthfully I just couldn't wait for it to end...but it just wouldn't.The fact that this is rated so highly absolutely baffles me. Are our standards for film this low now? Last time I throw my money away supporting a film from arguably the most overrated director in the history of film. Christopher Nolan, you are a such a BORE."
"OppenheimerIt's interesting that now, a time fully surrounded by political rhetoric and opposing sides on seemingly everything, there is a remembrance that it's actually been this way for a very long time.At its core (pun intended) ""Oppenheimer"" is knee-deep in a reflection about Mccarthyism. Probably something most have forgotten from their brief studies into US political history that one sophomore afternoon in High School. Beyond that, nothing.""Oppenheimer"" is also about what can happen when the collective is all pulling in the same direction. In this case the collective science and knowledge from most of the brightest people of the last 120 years; brought together for one single purpose.Lastly, of course ""Oppenheimer"" visits world history as it reflects on the unknown, war, and the atomic (now nuclear) age.The move reveals itself in layers, swirling between the past and present, with distinctly different topics all finding themselves interwoven.As the goal was ending WWII, in many ways the fears they had of possibly ending the world instead STILL transcend upon us in fear today. They call it mutually assured destruction, one which was certain envisioned and predicted 7+ decades ago.It's odd to say that ""Oppenheimer"" the movie is a slow-burn as it is a VERY slow burn indeed. Especially when you overlay the fast burn, the explosion, the devastation that occurs at an instant when viewing the film as only about a bomb. It is... however it really isn't at all.With an evening to digest the movie prior to this review, there was a lot of interesting cinematography, history-telling of multiple stories, and facts just touched upon that made for an interesting... but not a fantastic... movie.All in all, it was nice to see the crowds at the AMC theater with Barbie and MI playing too. Oppenheimer was a B- from me, a C from her."
First I saw barbie but barbie was delayed so me and my friend misst the start and we both regrets that because this movie was so good and I would probably watch it even if it was 5 hours long and I would like to have it in a longer version because I didn't want it to end because it is such en amazing movie and I think everyone should watch it I would 100% watch it over barbie and I would recommend this movie to anyone and there is so good jump scares whit the bomb that even tho I knew I jumped I would watch this over the moste movies and I would probably say it the best movie of this I have watch.
"I loved the acting, the shots, and the sound. The beginning of the movie is incredible with foreshadowing and explaining the history. The build up to the test detonation is like no other. Violins, intensity and just amazing shots once the bomb drops. The movie has a great mix of both the personal and work life of Oppenheimer. Where it takes a dive is after the test bomb. I feel like Nolan could've captured more of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the effect it had on the people in Japan. He shows nothing and sort of skips over it. Ending was slightly dragged out but the last scene is breathtaking. Overall one of Nolan's best but a tier below interstellar/ dark night."
"Good movie but can be watched at home. Nothing special honestly, you would think with how much they advertised and the nonstop marketing campaign, that this movie would be a bang! Not literally! Mission Impossible was way better. What kind atomic bomb movie doesn't have a BIGGG boom somewhere in between! Only Oppenheimers character made sense. The rest were pretty much mediocre including our beloved Iron Man! They downgraded women so badly in this movie haha I can't wait for the feminists to draw up a big propaganda. But anyways this is how women were treated back in those days. Save up and watch at home. No need to waste your money at the movies!"
Just finished an Imax 70mm showing. What an incredible film. The first 20 minutes with. Göransson's soundtrack along with the effects depicting Oppenheimer visualizing particles and waves almost brought me to tears. From then on its a fast paced ride taking you through Oppenheimers early study of quantum physics and his involvement in the Manhattan Project. All the while you are placed in an anxious state as you watch his life be scrutinized due to the highly classified nature of the project shifting through time periods. The editing is masterfully done to stitch the ideas and dialogue together. It culminates with a chilling end and a leaves you wondering if the chain reaction he created can ever be stopped. Will be seeing it as many times as I can in theaters.
"Nolan has a reputation for creating thought-provoking and visually stunning films, and ""Oppenheimer"" promises to be no exception. With a talented cast, a compelling story, and Nolan's signature cinematic style, this film is sure to be a cinematic event that will be talked about for years to come.One of the most exciting aspects of ""Oppenheimer"" is the cast. The film will star Cillian Murphy in the lead role as J. Robert Oppenheimer, and he is joined by a talented ensemble cast that includes Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey Jr. With such an impressive cast, it's clear that Nolan is committed to bringing the story of Oppenheimer to life in a powerful and engaging way.But what really sets ""Oppenheimer"" apart is the story itself. The Manhattan Project was one of the most significant and controversial events in modern history, and Nolan has the opportunity to explore the complex ethical, moral, and political issues that surrounded its development. The film promises to explore not just the scientific and technical aspects of the project, but also the human drama and personal struggles of the people involved.Of course, no Christopher Nolan film would be complete without stunning visuals and mind-bending concepts, and ""Oppenheimer"" is sure to deliver on that front as well. Nolan has a reputation for pushing the boundaries of what's possible in filmmaking, and ""Oppenheimer"" promises to be his most ambitious project yet.Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" is shaping up to be an epic and thought-provoking film that will showcase Nolan's unparalleled talent for storytelling, visual spectacle, and complex themes. With an impressive cast, a compelling story, and Nolan's visionary direction, ""Oppenheimer"" promises to be a cinematic experience that will stay with audiences long after the credits roll."
"There is absolutely no doubt that Oppenheimer will go down as one of the greatest biopics in history. It's to slow, it's boring, it's to long. NO WAY. It's an absolute masterpiece that encompasses the life span of one of the most influential people in history. This movie is brilliantly paced and divided to provide an introspective look into his early life and later troubles in an easy to digest way. The absolute best thing about the movie is the sound design. Usually Nolan's movies are to loud but with Oppenheimer it's welcome. You feel the explosions hit you in the chest and it's AMAZING. GO SEE IT FOR YOURSELF IN THEATRES AND SEE."
"Going into this movie I already know it is going to be different and slow pace than Nolan's other movies. Which isn't bad. The score, cinematography, script and atmosphere is top notch. It make you feel like you really are back in time. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr acting are some of the best I have seen. Cillian really catch Oppenheimer perfectly. His struggle with creating the atomic bomb and the questioning of his loyalty to the US at the end will keep you on the edge. The atomic bomb test scene is one of the best I have seen in cinema. The score bringing up the tension and nervousness of the people there. To the sound and vision of the atomic bomb exploding. With no cgi. This is a once in a life time movie experience. I would recommend watching it."
"After letting the movie marinate in my head for some time, i am dissapointed with it. Plain and simple. I am the biggest Nolan fan (Inception, Interstellar and TDK are in my top 5 all time), and this, plus the fact that almost everyone seems to be putting this movie through the roof, made me go in with more hype than i've had in a long time. Unfortunately, the movie is not what i expected. Not by a long shot. As a big fan of history, plus anything to do with atomic bombs/nuclear power, and everything the trailers led us to believe, i thought Nolan would create a fast paced, time distorted story around some of my favorite topics. Instead, time distorting is what i felt in the last hour of the movie, as it felt as though time was standing still and the movie dragged on until the end. The reason for this is that Nolan focuses 90% of this 3 hour movie on the events outside the creation of the bomb, with long drawn out court/interrogation scenes, making this feel more like a Strauss vs Oppenheimer than about the story of the father of the atomic bomb. For context, i love great dialogue in movies/TV. But this was too much and not interesting enough. The black and white honestly didnt land either. Also, after hearing for months about the explosion scene that Nolan created with no CGI, hearing him say this needed to be seen in Imax, hearing how this movie was gonna be a mindblowing display of sound/visuals, left me all the more dissapointed when the explosion scene lasted no more than 10 minutes. At first when it ended i thought, surely we will see more of it with the bombings of Japan, but no. That was it. Was the point of seeing it in Imax, only for those 10 (albeit great) minutes of the explosion scene? There is no need for Imax for 3 hours of dialogue. I also heard several people in th early screenings talk about a ""horror"" theme to this movie. Maybe those people had just finished watching Barbie and were not being objective. This movie did not have horror themes at all. It barely explores Oppenheimer's feelings after the bombs are released. Instead we see the final hour with more of Strauss vs Oppie. Let me also give some credit where its due. The cinematography, the sound, and the acting were great. Its what we expect of Nolan. But when you strip away all those things and look at only the story, its not great, instead its quite boring. Looking only at the story, i could have been fooled into thinking this was a documentary movie on netflix. Perhaps its on me, for going in with such high expectations for a Nolan movie. If you haven't seen it yet, lower your expectations."
"It was hard to follow and got all the dots together. Movie is mostly dialogues with hard to find the context plus different timelines switched all the time while trying to follow what's going on.I thought the movie was about developing the bomb, moral aspects, other history events and world wide consequences to the weapon. I was terrible wrong. Movie is full of dialogues and telling you what is going on instead of showing it and this for 3 hours straight.Just 40 minutes in I started to get bored and by 1h I was typing on my phone... Also around the middle I was thinking about leaving the cinema for real and this wish was getting bigger every passing minute.In the end of the movie you don't really learn anything or even know what you've just watched. So I can't explain why people saying it's 10/10 or whatever positive about it because there is nothing."
To truly understand and enjoy the film you need to read the book first. There are any number of subtle nods to the book and Oppenheimer's life that are missed unless you know.The cinematography is utterly amazing and it's best seen in IMAX.An all star cast and many seasoned character actors help bring this film to life. Robert Downey Jr plays a role of a lifetime as does Cillian Murphy. I was fully engaged and never moved from my seat the entire three hour film.Oppenheimer's life led him to be an American hero even with all his flaws. The film covers only about 20 years of his life but leaves you wanting to know more.
"This has to be greatest movie of this decade. Stunning background music, acting and cinemetography makes this movie hook this audience even for three hours. Also the movie just don't only revolve around the making of atomic bomb but also contains the court drama after math where Robert J. Oppenheimer will be accused of being connected with communist party. This movie also showcase the political view and some glimpse of Oppenheimer's college life. But the most importantly this movie display the regret of Oppenheimer aftermath. Cillian Murphy had nailed in his character with his emotions and also the support cast has done their job brilliantly."
"This is undoubtedly one of the best films I have ever seen, and it deserves to be experienced in the highest quality possible, ideally on the big screen.In that particular scene where Oppenheimer delivers his victory speech and the crowd is cheering, only to transition into a horrified girl screaming, followed by complete silence, I knew I was in for a real cinematic treat. The scene is executed so powerfully with its impeccable sound and visual design that the impact it left on me will resonate for a long time.The movie contains a lot of dialogue, numerous scientific references, and names, and very little action, making it a film that may not appeal to everyone. However, when the visual elements do come into play, they are absolutely breathtaking and will leave you in awe."
"In classic Nolan fashion, this story is not told in a straightforward manner, but in an action packed and thrilling way. Encapsulating the messy, chaotic and important life of Oppenheimer.There is never a dull nor boring moment in the movie. And it's all tied together perfectly by the amazing score of Ludwig Göransson.Everyone acted their roles perfectly, especially Cillian Murphy.Only 2 nitpicks are the scenes being hard to follow at times and the lack of those crazy practical effects.Simply a masterpiece & near perfection of a film. This 3 hour long biopic is a must watch for every movie lovers."
"Probably the only director of our times whose name is enough to pull the crowd to theaters. His best quality is that he thinks that the audience is smart enough to understand and doesn't spoon feed everything.Oppenheimer is a biographical thriller which makes Nolan sit in another league of filmmakers. His Nolan ness is stamped in every scene. Caution - don't expect action or masala entertainment here, it's a very serious study of the character of the father of the atomic bomb.Every time I see a biopic I want to go into the psyche of the protagonist but only a handful of movies were successful in doing that, and this is one of them. From the first frame till the last one you are with Oppenheimer, Nolan grabs you by neck and puts it into the mind of the character. His struggles, his inner turmoil, his guilt you feel it in every frame. This was also possible because of Cillian Murphy, It will be his career defining role. He has just become Oppenheimer. In some of the scenes his acting chops are just masterclass.Casting is done so perfectly that you cannot imagine any other actor in that role. RDJ makes worthy as a opponent to Cillian Murphys character. His brilliance overshadows his persona. Mat Damon, Emily Blunt, Cassey Affleck, Gary Oldman every one is brilliant in their portrayal. This is Nolan's legacy that great actor's have agreed to appear for one or two scenes just to be associated with Nolan and trust on his filmaking. Everyone has given their best.Music by Ludwig Göransson is special, it perfectly fits the scenes and makes the movie more immersive. Although I felt the Hans Zimmer mark on it. Cinematography, editing, production design, writing you name it every department has given their best to this project. Highlights are 2 sequences the detonation of the bomb and the gym speech sequence. This is the most refined film making you will get. Hats of to his vision and guts to not to use CGI. But still managing to get emotions out of you.We in India had something similar to this, the story of Nambi Narayanan. R Madhavan tried his best to make his directorial debut from this story but it felt short on a lot of levels. If you really want to compare, then compare The Nambi effect with Oppenheimer, you will know how much behind we are than Hollywood.For me by far this is Nolan's best as pure film making point of view. It's 3 hours long, dialogue and conversation heavy but the way it is paced you won't feel the length. But it doesn't have the same re-watchable quality like his other movies. It's not for everyone, normal film audience will be bored. But it's a feast for cinephiles like me. It stunns you with his craft. More power to Nolan. It's an Oscar studded movie, by far the best film of the year. Thank you for this and as always eagerly waiting for your next.#Oppenheimer #oppenheimermovie #moviereview #Oppenheimerreview."
"Overall it's Nolan. Intence,deep long conversations,and great cinematography, your brain have to be 100% active all the time, You know what I'm talking about if you've seen his previous works/films. Well it was not as confusing as tenet. Cillian Murphy carried the whole film, also the sound effects are incredible. This movie lives on your expectations, everything was worth it. The cast is perfect and specially cillian Murphy rocks man totally gives the feel, this was just an another masterpiece dropped by Christopher Nolan, I suggest that watch it on biggest screen possible, blindy go for IMAX, dont dare to miss a single second of the movie.overall the movie was pure cinema."
"Oppenheimer is one of if not the greatest films I've ever seen, every scene and every moment of this film had me captivated, I couldn't take my eyes off of it, I have never been so concentrated on a movie that I didn't fidget with my hands or check my phone, this movie kept me awake the entire 3 hours length, and that's saying something as I have ADHD and can't focus on movies sometimes. During Oppenheimer I laughed I cried and most of all I felt could feel, genuinely a perfect in my opinion. If you have the time to watch it I 100% recommend watching it, it's probably the best film out right now."
"I had the advantage of reading ""American Prometheus""'several years ago, otherwise some of the history and internal squabbles over ""Atomic versus Hydrogen"" bomb would have been lost on me. You don't have to read the book first but it will help. But I'm either case, GO SEE THIS MOVIE. We are all living in Oppenheimer's world, for better or worse. He deserves all the accolades he's ever received, and he was a very flawed human being. But give me someone who wrestled with his demons any day over the person who never reflected on their earlier actions with despair and guilt. Oppenheimer the man is for the ages, as is this movie."
This is a 3 hour movie and focus is mainly on Oppenheimer I grew up in the 1950 and I am aware of the historical story of Oppenheimer It is somewhat organized story and trying to do snippets in time events is not a great approach for three hour movie At times it is boring but acting is extremely well done It is not the best movie of the year and trying to call it is an Oscar because of what happened to Oppenheimer is really not interesting. It is sad but is not riveting The basic tenet of any movie should have interesting beginning middle and ending and the ending is probably the most interesting part of the movie Oppenheimer will always be remembered as the man along with Leslie Groves for running the Manhattan project The reality is that story should have focused on the development of the atomic bomb and men who created it and the struggles they had I found the movie with Paul Newman about Leslie Groves more interesting than this movie in certain aspects. In this era I think very few people would be interested to know what happened to Oppenheimer Also trying to look at what happened to him in the 1950 from a perspective of the 21st century is also flawed because of the adversary of the Cold War In reality Oppenheimer did give somewhat conflicting testimony as regards to certain events Of course he will be also regarded a hero and certainly was not a communist sympathizer by any means and loyal to his country He is a remarkable man who brought this project to success Cilian Murphy gave an outstanding performance and in some ways his personality personifies Oppenheimer (Does he ever smile in real life.)
"I haven't seen a worse movie in at least five years, at every level scripting, directing,editing, production. Embarrassingly amateurish, boring, repetitive, incomprehensible, written for low-IQ viewers. Almost all dialogue and attention is drowned out by the worst film ""music' ever composed - and entirely unsuited and unnecessary. An nsult to intelligence and taste. A very important true story is buried in the endless blathering hype and cutting. The acting is irrelevant and interchangeable. Even the sex scenes are extraneous, laughable and cold. No woman comes across as a credible character. The film attempts to offer a vision moral confusion and disgrace without the slightest concession made to the sequential clarity viewers expecting a 3-hour film."
"Oppenheimer is a very good movie, starring Cillian Murphy as Robert J. Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. The film is rated R for nudity and sexual themes, so many women are walking out of the theater for what they perceive to be patriarchal oppression. Though that part didn't personally bother me, Christopher Nolan could've deleted those scenes to get a PG-13 rating so the film could've grossed more money. Anyway, Oppenheimer's runtime is 3 hours 15 minutes.Now I really think Oppenheimer would be difficult for non-American audiences to fully appreciate and non-native English-speaking audiences to catch all the dialogue. The film is very dialogue heavy and the beat in the background is loud enough that you'll have to strain your ears. The film in general is difficult to fully grasp because of the huge cast of characters and the fractured narrative of the script. Lots of times, the film is in black and white. Nolan is also fixated on the historicity of the script such as when a general said, ""I don't want to drop the bomb on Kyoto because of its huge cultural significance and because my wife and I honeymooned there."" Or when Oppenheimer said, ""Now that we've finished our work at Los Alamos, I plan to give the land back to the Indians."" Anyone not familiar with the history of the Manhattan Project would probably miss those lines of real-life lore.What really impressed me was how the film was basically broken up into three parts. The first part was about Oppenheimer's personal and academic life and how he theorized the atom bomb thanks to Albert Einstein's work in the field. The second part was when the general (Matt Damon) built a town in the New Mexico desert at Los Alamos so Oppenheimer could make and test the bomb. The third part was about the government interrogation of Oppenheimer's ties to communism and the bad guy named Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) who wanted to be appointed to a presidential cabinet position and gain bureaucratic powers setting Oppenheimer up for failure. Thus the movie's themes and subplots wove together like an elegant tapestry. My only problem is that the film is so dialogue heavy, you can't lose focus for a single scene. Cillian Murphy who I enjoyed as Thomas Shelby from Peaky Blinders stole the show."
"This movie had me on the edge of my seat the whole time, easily the easiest 3 hours of film watching ever. The great juxtaposition of the brilliance and downfall of man and the destruction science/men can bring. The music was amazing, the acting exceptional and the end very thought provoking.Every scene felt totally immersive and engaging. I felt the fear of the scientist when creating a new form of weapon and not knowing if it would destory the whole world upon detention. I felt the guilt of Oppenheimer and realizing what he actually had accomplished. It was such a beautiful masterpiece that leaves you thinking. I will definitely be making the story of Oppenheimer my new hyper fixation of the month."
"This movie, no matter how one looks at it, from the first second of it is magnificent. One possibly cannot take the movie in its complete sense after one watch. It craves multiple watches. The movie jumps right into it, and does not let you off for even a second until the very last moment. It's dialogue is maturely written by Mr. Nolan and shows huge respect to its audience. And the visual aspect of it with all of its glory there to see on the 70mm screen, is a treat that leaves to be craved even after a 3hr runtime. The movie with its pace shows the reality of how the US chased after the making of atomic bomb. The audio of this movie, not just dialogue but soundtrack, movie sounds, everything was masterfully managed by. Ludwig Gorannson, it perfectly supplements the visual storytelling while adding weight to each scene in its own right. And the acting is perfect. Mr. Murphy is exceptional, larger than life in this movie. RDJ is exceptional. Matt Damon is exceptional. Emily Blunt is exceptional. This movie has all the Oscar-nominating performances. The story is grounded to reality of the history, but is at the same time so tense in its execution, it really makes everyone sit on the edge of your seat for the good of latter part of the movie. The direction of the maestro Mr. Nolan is at his top here. Oppenheimer is the Magnum Opus of Nolan. From the first scene, the whole movie is through the eyes of Oppenheimer. The reality and its weight behind being the Father of the Atomic Bomb. This movie is about Oppenheimer, more than that part of the history of making the first Atomic Bomb.Simply put, this movie is made to be seen in the IMAX. If one puts the best of everything in a movie, it would turn out very close to what this movie has turned out to be."
"The Oppenheimer movie is an emotional rollercoaster, it awakes your senses being a visual and audio masterpiece, it's truly a statement of cinematic art and an art piece that raises the bar for future productions for it's perfection in the smallest details from makeup to sound to image to script ECT...
The cast was pure genius Florence Pugh was more than perfect in role execution , she is a torch carrier for the next generation of actors the energy and mixture of actors was in it self art like colors in a painting coming together to express or reflect a complex texture of emotions .And that's what created this cinematic wonder."
Tbh this movie should've brought no 1 and much and much more than barbie movie but time is now rolling with feminist movie well I don't know this Oppenheimer movie is the best there ever was or will be and should be no 1 forever i really loved it and Christopher Nolan is gem of a director.If people were honest they give this movie 10 rating but yet Barbie is getting all the top box office wonders why is that i guess people rate this high but instead go watch barbie.This movie should be no 1 at box office but i guess people are falling for that feminist movie but i stick with this Oppenheimer.
"The movie is 10/10. The actors did a great job,especially Cillian Murphy as Robert J Oppenheimer.Also RDJ was really good playing Lewis Strauss. Matt Damon was pretty good. This is a Christhoper Nolan Masterpiece. When he directs some movie you know its going to be good. I personally recommend this movie to everyone. The movies is R rated so kid's shouldn't watch it. Personally i think teens can watch it to. They were some intense scenes during the movie. Also i want to credit Emily Blunt,Florence Pugh,Rami Malek,Gary Oldman and Tom Conti. The Trinity Test Scene Was Epic and especially when they did that without CGI effects. They were some nude scenes but they weren't a problem and it was not to long. The acting was really good while watching the movie i didnt noticed any wooden acting. The scene felt pretty real.I really liked the ending when Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein talked. It was the best movie ending i got chills at the end of the movie. After Exiting the cinema i had a lot of thoughts about the movie. I was completly blown away by the movie it was so good. I think it deservese second watch. Personally i think i should watch this Christopher Nolan masterpiece again."
"Christopher nolan is one of my role models in filmmaking.One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure."
"Have come here to write what i had just witnessed, this is not just a movie, its like a profound experience where one gets lost and becomes one with whats happening in the movie. This movie is beyond exceptional, i havent written any reviews before, but this time i had to put my feelings to words. The storyline, acting, cinematography, dialogues, everything was perfect. It literally put me inside Oppenheimer's head, his thoughts, his feelings, He became me. All the characters even is they had no dialogue, just smiles or gazes, leaves a lasting impression on you. I really cant find words to describe this movie, just wanna relive it again. WOW. It seemed like there was no acting in the movie, it was real, like i was seeing the real Oppenheimer with real Einstein, all the scientists felt like they were really themselves, all the other characters, Oppenheimer's wife(Emily Blunt), colleagues, Lewis Strauss(RDJ), everyone was exceptional. Still cant get over it."
"I watched Oppenheimer on IMAX 1570 film at the only theatre showing this format in the Southern Hemisphere, the Melbourne IMAX.Overall, I think the movie is interesting, but it fails my expectations.First, I have read before viewing that the screen will be filled in some scenes. I assumed that those scenes would be the dramatic scenes. However, the aspect ratio keeps changing, even the middle of a scene, for no obvious reason. Take the example of the scene where Oppenheimer rode horses with his wife: it is not a dramatic scene. The changes are often quite jarring.Second, some of the bomb / explosion footage interspersed in the early parts of the film, for lack of a better analogy, look like Windows screensavers. Some of the footages are highly effective, such as the Trinity testing scene, but most of the time those scenes appear to be embellishments that don't gels particularly well with the narrative.I think the character writing is also quite weak given that the film has a three hours runtime. The motivations of Oppenheimer are not fleshed out well. The women characters, as you expect from a Nolan film, lack dimension. The suicide lacked enough context to make sense."
"This movie has a great staff of actors who all did a great job, especially Emily Blunt who really shows her chops in her limited role in the film. The sets of the period where very accurately represented it made you feel like you were in the 1940's, the cinematography was excellent. All of this should make for a great film.Unfortunately, the movie is full of video and sound gimmicks and doesn't deliver on the true story due to extreme political overtones. After 3 hours of viewing, I'm thinking what did I get from this movie? Pretty much nothing, it truly was a bomb!So why is this movie so popular?"
"A very fast paced film that jumped forwards and backwards a lot. Additionally, it had some weird decisions regarding music and camera movement that (I'm not an expert on the art of film making but I enjoy it and study it). Can be hard to follow if you don't have enough knowledge regarding American and War history. A small amount of scenes could've in my opinion, done without the loud music as it made it difficult to understand dialogue and feel connected in the story. However, the film had amazing performances by the cast, brilliant use of sound and lighting to influence the audience's emotions as well as incredible visuals that invite you into the story. Creating a historical film can be challenging as the actions of characters and events are extremely limited to what is and was accurate, but Christopher Nolan delivers a powerful film that covers a significant event in history, which needs to be acknowledged more as it has impacted society a lot more than people think."
"Read the book first if you can, but regardless this does an amazing job at breaking down a very complex man. Amazing acting. Amazing direction. I think every part was played by a known actor. How they pulled that off is impressive, but it just made the movie come alive. The way the movie began by showing how Oppy was figuring out physics was so cool. It's like you were in his brain.Not to mention the fact that this story was unbelievable with out the Oppy stuff. I mean, build a town and create a bomb that is all theory under the gun of a world war. Really entertaining.Can't wait to watch it again."
"Overall: Unlike Nolan's usually fictitious style, this movie contains profound depth and character. It is extremely impactful as it not only covers one of the most important moments in history, but it also is perhaps one of the best films to have ever been created.Critic:The movie is not for the average Joe as the dialogues are high-paced and the spoken English is for the most part sophisticated. Those who have no knowledge of the historical context will certainly struggle to grasp it.Acting: Although Cillian Murphy has shown his best acting yet, which is definitely one of the best I have ever witnessed in my lifetime, the other actors, namely Matt Damon and Robert Downey Jr. Showed outstanding performances as well. I did sense a Thomas Shelby energy several times, but I'm guessing at this point that's really Murphy's own personality poured into the characters. The film cast & crew will certainly fill in many seats at the next Academy Awards."
"Openheimer is an amazing movie from start to finish. Cillian Murphy's performance is Oscar worthy and Christopher Nolan's directing as always is absolutely fantastic.The story is just prefect, we get a good look at the live of 'The father of the atomic bomb'. We see how making the A-bomb changed him and how it changed the rest of the world. This movie perfectly shows how the making of the A-bomb was one of the most important moments in the history of mankind The movie is understandable for everyone, even if you don't know much about the A-bomb it's an enjoyable movie.In my opinion this is one of the best movies of this decade."

"Its about the f Bomb and the maker so .. that is that , i thank all the staff and specially cillian murphy for the effort on making the movie ,Peace.If you're looking for biographical and emotional at the same time yes you can find it here , but if you looking for action thats no no action in that , Murphy just nailed it cuz he has that good character look for 19s era and seems so gentle , otherwise I don't think anyone will fit that style.I would suggest that you search for some information about oppenheimer befor watching it well reveal hidden things of his life that its in the story but the movie just showing it straight out without details."
"It's long, but it speeds along and takes concentration which is so refreshing. Nolan takes audience on a unique and brilliant cinematic journey. Cast is excellent, with cameos from so many great actors was a whose who of acting master class! The story is one that should be better known and after this it Will definitely be well known.It's definitely one that needs to be seen in the cinema to get the full experience. If Cillian and Downey don't clear up in the awards season it will be a travesty. The torment after what was created and the impact of it is depicted in such a clever way. Definitely become a classic."
"As good as expected. Maybe some people think that it took too long, but i get it, the point is not about the nuclear bomb that finally he created. But, it's about the character, pressure, situation, internal conflict, and lot of messages he sent in the 2nd of this movie, that most people not predict it.Even i did'nt expect it. Firstly, i think it will be boring, because ""oh here it is, the bomb has created, and they won it"". But, i was wrong. It wasn't over. They gave me another conflict building. Brilliant.Really appreciate, the character, the music, AND THE PLOT. One of the best nolan's master piece."
"Very detailed lengthy profile of Oppenheimer, in charge of America's race to develop the Atomic bomb by assembling a team of nuclear scientists.. Cillian Murphy must be a shoo in already as the next Oscar best actor winner. Strong support from Matt Damon and an unrecognisable Robert Downey junior.Several members of the team had certain Communist leanings before WW2 and this continued throughout the project. As usual in Hollywood the contribution of British physicists was minimised, especially that of James Chadwick who was awarded a Nobel prize.The nuclear tests in the desert are undeniably powerful and awe inspiring. The dropping of bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki certainly curtailed the was in the east. However, Nolan missed a trick by omitting archival footage of the explosions and their aftermath e.g. Pictures of damaged survivors suffering long term effects. The Hiroshima Peace Park should also be includes as a final scene."
"I was expecting something like Interstellar, but not 15 minutes of Quantum Mechanics, Nuclear Physics, or any sort of Physics throughout the entire 180 minutes of the film. Instead, there were lots of internal politics and spying investigations of the US Government at that time. As I am not North American, I couldn't relate to all these backstories regarding what went wrong with Oppenheimer back then. I will surely accept that it was my mistake not to check the genre of the movie. Apart from that, I didn't like the usage of the Sri Bhagavad Gita in the movie. They could have shown him reading it in the lab or something. Also, when Jean Tatlock asks him 2nd time to speak Sanskrit script, again Murphy just translated it."
"Absolutely stunning. A great critique of post war America. The fact that this film ever got made is unbelievable. A film critical of the USA political system at that time with a nod of the head to JFK.It is visually stunning and full of so many important facts that the youth of today would never understand. If Cillian Murphy doesn't win an Oscar for his amazing performance then we are back to politics. Great film. Best one I've seen in the last 5 years.I must also say that the performance from Robert Downey Jr is nothing short of perfection and if justice is served he has at least to be a nominee at the Oscar's for best supporting actor.Christopher Nolan is a talent as we've not seen since Spielberg was at his peak, which is not to say that SS has passed his peak.I went to see Mission Impossible part 121 before this and looked at it in admiration for its special effects and of course the outstanding, most underrated actor of modern times, Tom Cruise. He is so versatile why has he never been given a gong ?Anyway just go and see it. Tbh my wife fell asleep. I thought it a fantastic critique of America at that time.If the world wasn't full of people pushing their own ambitions then this would garnish a shed load of Oscars.Barbie will probably win though
Such sadness
What a majestic film
Not Barbie though if you still have any active neurons
Just my opinion.Oppenheimer the film of the year ?By an absolute country mile in my humble, irrelevant, opinion."
"Christopher Nolan has, indeed, tried to walk a different path with this movie - but this is based on a true story after all with a clear message to all in the present circumstance/s the world is venturing in. People always had that greed for fake popularity since time immemorial or you say being a charlatan. And things haven't changed much till date, have they? This is a movie that may not thrill you but will drive you emotionally.If you get absorbed in this movie, your emotions will kick in and channelise in a way that you will start asking yourself if you have been carrying out your duties in a humane way! The onus is more pronounced if you are a scientist and you invent something that is eventually or more meant for mass destruction. Persons of quality never expect anything in return - they just do their duty in a bohemian style only to be termed gullible or naive at the end. Perhaps, they enjoy it being that way only!"
"I was young when I first saw one of Christopher Nolan's films "" Inception"" I couldn't understand anything but yet I felt the emotions and the rush he delivers.Now I'm happy and glad that I saw his work in my 20's I can finally understand.Oppenheimer made me feel the horror and the power of physics and made me respect the scientist even more, I felt bad for the innocent civilians who got affected by the Bomb.This movie's visuals, sounds, transitions will make your heart race and force you to pay attention. The dialogue and the story is outstanding.You will be connected deeply to the character."
"Oppenheimer. A historical feature film that tells us the course of events in one of the most crucial moments of World War II and shows in a raw and controversial way, how far one is capable of going to achieve victory.I found the plot itself too dense, although it is understandable since it deals with such a complex subject matter. Still, I think it could have been handled in a more digestible way for the viewer.The script tells the story, alternating between different timelines, a methodology that has become the celebrated director's personal signature.In this film, Nolan offers us a narrative formed by dialogues full of information that, at times, are released at a somewhat accelerated pace, a fact that at times can generate confusion and make you see yourself in the situation of reorganizing the ideas in your head, to finish understanding what you are being told.Audiovisually speaking, it is a work of art, like all of the director's creations.The sound representation is a fundamental part that makes the cinematographic experience exciting.As is the image, which envelops you and makes you forget where you are with its constant, back and forth black and white shots.Even so, there were moments when I expected more, as in the moment of the explosion, where I had the expectation of experiencing a more shocking visual terror, because that was what we were promised, but far from being so, the scene has the same impact, managing to convey the anguish and uncertainty of the characters.However, for me, the jewel in the crown were the masterful performances of the cast. An exceptional cast, led by the brilliant Cillian Murphy, who delivers a Robert Oppenheimer performance, practically unbeatable and worthy, without a doubt, of an Oscar nomination.This is not a war movie, not even a biopic, it goes beyond that. It is a cinematic puzzle of a historical, political, scientific and even philosophical nature. A portrait of guilt, caused by the greedy search for recognition and power.It is a story with a morally complex undertone and with a final reflection so existentialist that, at the end, it leaves you wondering what would you have done?So I can't say if this is Christopher Nolan's best creation, what I do know is that, if you're up to it, this is an experience worth seeing and enjoying on the big screen."
"As I watched Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"", I had a couple of questions: Was he a Communist? The film left me with the impression that he was an ""intellectual"" communist but maybe not a political one - a member of the Community Party. The second question it raised for me: Was he an opportunist? On this point, the answer was a little clearer - probably so.The film depicts Robert Oppenheimer as a man of great intellect with an ego to match. Cillian Murphy - the Irish actor in the title role - delivers a performance that shows the complexity of his make-up in a way that justifiably is generating Oscar ""buzz"". Robert Downey, Jr. And Matt Damon give outstanding performances as foils for Oppenheimer's brilliance."
"It was the way that Nolan presented the story of a historic man was mind blowing. Nothing short of brilliance and the practical effects. Must watch for every one.Cillian Murphy was at his best. And my my Robert Downey Jr, a class act. Nolan always uses most of his cast members from his previous films. It's like he adores them.In short acting was top notch.Direction was top notch.Writing was top notch.It was a 3 hour masterpiece and not once did I feel that the movie has lost its pace or I want the movie to end. Nolan is definitely one of the greatest filmmakers of our time. WB you just lost a gem!"
Oppenheimer was amazingly good 10/10 o Christopher Nolan made such a really damn good movie all the scenes were damn good!And Nolan even detonated the real explosives and the atomic bomb was also a real explosive although it wasn't such a real atomic bomb with a strong increase in radiation when they shot the scene but damn what a good one!They showed Fatman and LittleBoy who left from los alamos and were going to drop down in Hiroshima and Nagasaki!Everyone did an amazing job of the acting they did so damn good acting Cillian Murphy nailed it as Oppenheimer he did it so damn good he needs an Oscar.
"I may consider myself lucky to be alive to watch Christopher Nolan Works which get better by years.Oppenheimer is - with no doubt- going to be one of the best movies in the history. Amazing cinematography, Exceptional acting and terrifying Soundtracks.All the cast are great from cilian Murphy who is going for the oscar with this role to Rupert Downey jr and Emily blunt and finally rami malik who has small scenes but you will never forget them.I didn't watch it in Imax as i couldn't wait and ran to the nearest cinema but now i will sure book an imax ticket.Don't waste any time, book your ticket and Go watch it.. NOW."
"I am going to be honest and say that I am by no means a Christopher Nolan worshiper but was still pretty excited too see Oppenheimer. Interstellar and The Dark Knight are one of the best films I have ever seen in a theater so the bar was set pretty high. Fortunately, Oppenheimer mostly met my expectations. You definitely feel the runtime due to it being very dialoge heavy but I was never bored. The acting for the most part was great from every single actor but the script was pretty lackluster and the score which was haunting yet beautiful at times became way too intrusive during certain scenes. The movie did do a fantastic job at helping anyone unfamiliar with the dangers of atomic bombs understand that they can literally destroy the entire planet. My problem with Oppenheimer is that something felt like it was missing and I can't quite put my finger on what it is. Maybe it was the pacing which for a 3 hour long film was surprisingly way too fast. It is definitely very overhyped and nowhere near Nolan's best work, but overall I enjoyed it even though I won't be revisiting the film anytime soon."
"Hate to say it, but the movie is quite bad. I usually really enjoy Nolan's work but this one is lacking any redeemable characteristics. The main issue is that it is boring. The story itself is interesting but the way it is presented is dull. It felt like 3 hour long trailer. Every scene had to be dramatic with over the top dramatic music and dialog. And when you have only dramatic scenes you don't have any dramatic scenes. Even the explosion lacked any actual effect. The only dramatic thing about it was that we had some 30 seconds of quietness. The movie had that stupid dramatic music non-stop. NON-STOP! The actors were fine, put the script was lackluster and I think the cast, the music, all the drama and the way the story was presented was because they knew the scrips was bad. Also I don't know who that movie targets. I feel like years ago history movies targeted people who would appreciate them and because they were done with a lot of love to the story, attention to details and made interesting they were appealing not only to history buffs. Nowadays historical movies target everybody so they are no longer historical but exaggerated dramas that are only inspired loosely by history. The movie really sucks."
"Christopher Nolan did it again. One of the best movies I have ever seen, which I was quite skeptical if I would've liked after all of his masterpieces. But this one was different. My eyes were drawn to the screen every second and mesmerized at every scene. The cinematography did not disappoint, the contrary actually. So glad that Cillian had the opportunity to do the main role, which he did it flawless. Have always loved the way he acted. You could see just through his face what his emotions were. My favorite scene, for sure was the bomb scene. The countdown brought all the audience together and the music was perfect that just accentuated the tension. Loved the way it didn't just exploded that was the obvious thing to happen. It showed the emotion of every character and demonstrated how everything would change after it. And you could say it was literally a bomb because after it everything was explained like an atomic bomb. Can't imagine a better ending. The way it showed the two judgements ( and their similarities) and ended with the einstein conversation. Brilliant! Honestly i wanna watch at least three more times to grasp and fathom every detail. I think even the whole world wouldn't be enough screen to watch because of how beautiful it was. So Christopher Nolan did it again a flawless work witch will be forever in history . He is a genius."
"I had no knowledge of the who's who in the making of The Bomb, so I think I had an unbiased opinion.The film was extremely well made, a difficult subject to try and follow if you dont know physics but despite that I think it portrayed how the feelings and emotions of those involved felt about what they are doing. I thoroughly enjoyed it but will probably have to re watch to fully understand the politics of it all.1
Again it shows that those in power don't care about the social and personal impact of making such a device on the individual.The top brass weren't interested in how their actions played out in the long run."
"Christopher Nolan's much-anticipated film, ""Oppenheimer,"" is a visually stunning and thought-provoking cinematic experience that delves into the tumultuous life of the brilliant physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. As expected from a Nolan film, it delivers on its promise of grandeur and spectacle, offering audiences a captivating exploration of history, science, and the human condition.Set against the backdrop of World War II, ""Oppenheimer"" artfully captures the tension and urgency of the Manhattan Project, where Oppenheimer and his team raced against time to develop the first atomic bomb. Nolan's mastery of visual storytelling is on full display as he recreates the era with impeccable attention to detail, immersing the audience in the atmosphere of the 1940s.At the heart of the film is Cillian Murphy's mesmerizing portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Murphy's performance is both commanding and vulnerable, bringing to life the complexity of the man behind the scientist. He deftly conveys Oppenheimer's brilliance, ambition, and internal conflicts, leaving the audience torn between admiration and empathy for this enigmatic figure.The film explores not only Oppenheimer's scientific achievements but also delves into the moral dilemmas faced by him and his team. Nolan masterfully weaves in ethical questions about the development and use of the atomic bomb, forcing the audience to confront the complexities of scientific progress and its potential consequences.As with many Nolan films, ""Oppenheimer"" employs a non-linear narrative, which, while intellectually stimulating, might prove challenging for some viewers to follow. The film jumps back and forth in time, showcasing various key moments in Oppenheimer's life, often leaving audiences to piece together the chronology. While this approach adds depth to the storytelling, it may require multiple viewings to fully grasp the intricate nuances of the plot.Another highlight of the film is its spectacular cinematography and visual effects. Nolan's signature cinematic flair elevates pivotal moments, particularly during the tense scientific experiments and the dramatic conclusion of the Manhattan Project. The use of practical effects and meticulously crafted sets heightens the film's authenticity, transporting the audience back to a pivotal point in history.Where ""Oppenheimer"" slightly falters is in its pacing. At times, the film lingers on certain scenes, delving into intricate scientific discussions that might lose the attention of casual viewers. Additionally, some character arcs, including those of supporting cast members, feel underdeveloped, leaving certain relationships and motivations less fleshed out than desired.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a visually arresting and intellectually stimulating cinematic endeavor that offers a captivating glimpse into one of history's most influential figures. Christopher Nolan's direction, combined with Cillian Murphy's exceptional performance, elevates the film to great heights. However, the complexity of the narrative and occasional pacing issues might be a minor drawback for some viewers. Nevertheless, ""Oppenheimer"" remains a must-see for those who appreciate historical dramas that challenge the boundaries of storytelling and provoke contemplation on the human impact of scientific advancements."
"Nolan's direction in is truly remarkable. In a non-linear chronological order, he weaves together the two timelines, offering viewers Oppenheimer's subjective experience in vivid color and others consequential perspective in black and white. This duality brilliantly portrays Oppenheimer's personal struggles in color(scenes from the first person) and the far-reaching impact of his actions in black and white (scenes from others points of view)....Indeed, individual perceptions of color and its symbolic representation can vary greatly,.,..I gave ""OPPENHEIMER"" a 8-star rating due to its offensive portrayal of the Bhagavad Gita, which disappointed me as an Indian viewer. Additionally, I expected more in-depth coverage of the history of the neutron bombardment, as the film's depiction was too brief... As a biographical drama it's really enjoyable, especially for science enthusiasts. However, some may find the negotiation scenes lengthy and tiresome. For fans of Christopher Nolan's cinematography, this film is worth watching to see how he presents the scenario in a 3-hour timeframe🕓🕖...."
"Perfect Nolan's treat Worth watching it. Cillian Murphy's screen presence and Downey's performance nailed it. Kept the audience on their seat for the whole duration. Even if it looks like a documentary film it really deals with a lot starting off from Oppenheimer till the bomb. Nolan did his magic again with the cast and in techincal terms. Don't miss this epic art.The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!"
"I went to watch 2AM SHOW IN IMAX , PAKISTAN AND IT WAS HOUSEFUL/COMPLETE SOLD OUT.People are crazy about NOLAN'S WORK.I DON'T KNOW ABOUT REST OF THE WORLD GUYS ,BUT ASIA IS CRAZY ABOUT CHRISTOPHER NOLAN AND HIS WORK.MARVELLOUS!Great acting, cinematography & everything about this movie is love!Nolan's movies are always great. Cillian is awesome and maybe that's the reason he has been part of the most of Nolan's movies.It's 3 hours long movie and even thinking about it will make you believe that it's boring? But it's Christopher Nolan's universe, you'll not get bored even for a second because of story, effects, sound etc. Proper engagement!Phenomenal."
"Can even a history film be told non-linearly? Yes it can. Only a legend Christopher Nolan could do this. There may be other directors can do, it takes a certain courage to tell a story like this. Science and politics are shown in this film and that too with perfect elegance. Must watch in theaters.Many people are questioning where the bombing scene is in Japan. It is unnecessary for this story. We came to see Oppenheimer's story. Not the suffering of the Japanese. Watch this movie with proper understanding.So overall it is a good intellectual movie. Really enjoyed my imax experience. Good 👍🏻"
"Nolans most emotional since Interstellar.The ending is both Nolans best ever ending, and one of the most harrowing scenes I've ever seen. Its so rare that a movie clings onto you when you leave the theatre, this one will. I think this is Nolans greatest achievement, because it perfectly encapsulates an incredibly necessary message.The character arcs especially Kitty and Robert Oppenheimer are remarkable. Florence Pugh has a fantastic impact on the movie she smashes it out of the park. The cinematography is beautiful, what at first seems a limited area in Los Alamos, provides some astonishing shots.The story is written in an extraordinary way. Theres not a single hole, not a single element un concluded.The score is outrageous, it impeccably allows the horror of the movie to completely latch onto you."
"An American-British biopic thriller; A story about physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, appointed to develop and design the atomic bomb. After his scientific team's work comes to fruition he faced the consequences of speaking truth to power. This is an ambitious character study epic with big scope and spectacle. It relies on a tour de force from Cillian Murphy who harnesses the anguish, guilt, gloom, and haughtiness of the title character in a layered performance. The optics captivate, which it must, and it haunts, as it should, given the enormity of real-life events and it is brilliant in showing how ambition and morality can end up in silos. Despite its meticulous, fact-based psychodrama it is a broad story with strong visuals and sound design. Exposition was critical for the plot so great minds of the age who had varied involvement in the arms race were introduced. But the first 45 minutes played out like a long film trailer with biographical detail that was often clunky. Eventually a hiatus in the musical score led the way for suspense to build to a gripping centrepiece sequence whereon the director's expertise in choreography was evident. Films which are dialogue-heavy can assuage the feeling of being overwrought by using montages which help with the viewing experience. The absence of this at times worked to the film's detriment. Long feature films need to earn emotional engagement too. The male-female narrative seemed curtailed and the third hour's pacing was at times enervating with its long legal meetings and political scrapping. Overall, a bold, fascinating film about a complicated legacy with many strong supporting performances, but it was dizzy and occasionally clotted in delivery."
"Oppenheimer while a solid film is not what I expected.I'll start with the great. The performances especially Robert Downey Jr are off the chart. Emily Blunt has an absolute masterful scene. Cillian Murphy is very good as Oppie.The good. It's an interesting film that FEELS important. It's shot well of course. Many of the scenes hold your interest.The rest: it's too long... and for no reason. It's 3 separate films poorly edited into a mismatched formal outfit. Additionally, the sound mix fails miserably. The big moments are big; however, the dialogue is often missed at crucial moments of the film making the through line difficult to follow.It feels like a film that wants to be Oliver Stone's JFK; but, fails to have an underlying story interesting enough to justify the black and white and odd cut backs. The atom bomb is a sideline to the story unlike every ad campaign which makes it the primary focus. By the time we TEST the bomb (considering we don't see anything of Hiroshima or Nagasaki) we are left with another hour of the same beat over and over and over in a claustrophobic coat closet of a conference room with 2 dimensional characters including Oppenheimer himself for every single scene in the room or similar 2 dimensional congressional hearing members droning on about whether Downey (who is brilliant) should be confirmed for a cabinet position.I wanted to love this film but it's just another big budget effort that fails to meet expectations."
"Oppenheimer has everything to be the film of the year. One of the few films recorded in Imax, surreal, certainly adds to the experience.About the film, it is the consecration of Chris Nolan's directing style. The execution of the work with his signature this time was perfect, no narrative slips, nothing exaggerated and nothing omitted, the film uses the techniques in the right measure.The filmmaker's best film so far brings back the puzzle narrative, in a more spiral format, especially at the beginning of the film. This type of narrative is one that makes you think, build the film along with the execution of it. The beginning of the film demands a lot of attention. Many timelines in quick scene cuts, many new persons introduced, many situations presented out of order: it is the perfect experience for those who enjoy this type of film. Like a puzzle, you're given several pieces that are unlocked for you to piece together the story. If you lose your attention in those first 30-45 minutes of plot and can't put together the narrative, it will be difficult to understand from there. When the pieces fall into place and you understand the timelines (which are few here, when it comes to Nolan), enjoying the art of the film in the next 2:30 hours of film is a great experience!Oppenheimer brings a new way to watch a biopic unlike anything you've watched before in this genre. The three hours of film pass as if they were one, the pace of the film is electrifying, quick cuts, quick takes, most scenes last a few seconds, before moving on to another point in the story. Very few scenes drag on for more than 30 seconds.The casting is immense, there are many characters, many actors, many names (which may sound confusing at some point), that the film does not prioritize presenting the trajectory of each one in detail - and it would never have been able to, such a large number of actors -, the performances are of a high level, and the puzzle narrative diminishes in the middle of the film, helping to understand the narrative thread in this large number of actors. Cillian Murphy's performance is extraordinary, by far the best developed character in all of Nolan's filmography, it gave him space to shine and he delivers a lot. Robert Downey Jr also delivers a great performance, in fact the best or one of the best of his career. Emily Blunt manages to dominate the dramatic scenes throughout the film. In my opinion, a cohesive script, with the perfect screen time for each character, given the relevance of each one in the story.Cinematography, visual effects (no cgi), editing, original score and sound editing are categories with a high probability of awards. The original score and editing of this film, in particular, caught my attention too much, quick cuts, great editing, non-linear at times, and when linear, with short scenes, in addition to the original score that holds you in your chair and gives a frantic pace to the film are exceptional.In summary, this film has Nolan at his best (debuting in a new studio, Universal), in his best film, managing to overcome all the negative nuances that hovered over his other works (little tenacity with the characters and exaggeration in his non-linear narrative vices). Far surpassing his last work, Tenet, which is his worst film.Oppenheimer is finished, mature, and Nolan's best yet. It has a chance in virtually all award categorias o Oscars. 10/10."
"In ways that only Christopher Nolan can do, Oppenheimer is a layered, critical thinking film with A-list surprises, brilliant cinematography, and a hell of a sound mixing team. There's history, there's science, there's humanity- it's all there for the viewer to interpret as deeply (or superficially) as they like. I love Christopher Nolan because I feel I can trust his work; sure there's some suspension of belief (it is Hollywood after all), but you know you'll walk away from the movie lingering on subtle scenes, powerful dialogue, challenging morals, etc. There's always always something to think about and relish, and Oppenheimer does not disappoint!"
"Christopher Nolan is back! Oppenheimer is the best film i watched this year. I can say this film is a masterpiece film, I will explain why. The first, of course, I was amazed by the acting of Cillian Murphy who played Robert Oppenheimer, who was very charismatic and authoritative. Secondly I really like the story which is very weighty and supported by strong characterization. There is one character that caught my attention, namely Albert Einstein, played by Tom Conti. The star cast that was presented were able to bring the characters they played very well, such as Robert Downey Junior who played Lewis Strauss, Emily Blunt who played Kitty, and Florence Pugh who played Jean Tatlock. This film has a duration of 181 mins, but because the visuals are so slick that it will make you feel comfortable while watching, in some scenes you can really feel the movement of the camera which makes you feel more and more carried into the film. I enjoyed watching this film, my heart was pounding with a visual interlude of explosions and of course it made me tense in one of the most eagerly awaited scenes. Maybe this is enough for my review, you don't need many reasons why you should watch this movie, you have to watch this movie because it's a Christopher Nolan movie, you know what it will be like 🔥.THIS IS CINEMA!"
"Today i watched Oppenheimer in Imax and in all honesty, it's the best movie i have ever seen. Before going today i isolated myself from every Oppenheimer content just because i wanted to be blown away by Nolan and his amazing cast and im so thankful that i managed to dodge spoilers and etc because after leaving the cinema i felt different and moved by the story. I cant exactly explain what this feeling is but i was not the same person that entered the movie theatre. Oppenheimer is a piece of art that you dont only see or observe, you experience it with your entire body and you spend the entire 3 hours on the edge of your seat with your heart pumping harder and harder as the movie progresses. I never felt anything like this before, not even in real life, i remained glued to my seat for the entire movie and i even forgot about eating my popcorn due to this extreme immersion that the director orchestrated. I wish i could erase Oppenheimer from my memory just so i can go and experience it again, in order to feel all of these emotions and feelings thats this masterpiece has to offer. I also gotta talk about the score of this movie and Ludwig Goransson delivers the most perfect soundtrack possible. This score is chilling, epic, beautiful and touching, making it one of the core aspects for immersion and it also builds up anxiety and terror inside the audience, enhancing the greatness of the story itself. The whole sound department did an extraordinary job in this film, it was all just perfect and fitting for the story. Cillian Murphy performs his best role to date as J Robert Oppenheimer and i really dont think anyone would do such an extraordinary job like Cillian did. Cristopher Nolan chose a brilliant cast and they delivered beyond expectations, every single one of them. In my opinion, Nolan and Cillian Murphy deserve the best movie and best actor oscars, respectively, without any contest and even Robert Downey Junior is a contestor for best supporting actor. As i said before, this experience changes you and your worldview is a different one compared to the one you had 3 hours ago and im just so glad that i got the opportunity to watch Nolans, and possibly cinema's best work of all time. Yeah i do recommend the filme its neat."
"I loved everything about it.I have now watched it a second time in imax. And my god the difference is enormous. You could see everything. Literally everything.I am still so impressed by this movie. Here are some of my thoughts:cutting between timelines:by showing, especially in the beginning, (older) oppenheimer speaking about (younger) oppenheimer and his life is europe, nolan gave the character so much more depth. I liked seeing how (older) oppenheimer thought about (younger) oppenheimer and his dessions.Oppenheimer's visions:
they were all in imax and cutting between cillian murphy's blue eyes and these explosions was a great idea. The way the entire cinema was filled with screen. And the sound wowimax:
you literally were in oppenheimer's time, sitting there watching him. It was phenomenal. Chris nolan kept saying how you should watch it on the biggest screen possible and i agree. I was blown away afterwards. This screen. This quality. Again you were literally in Los Alamos waiting for the Bomb to explode.Even though, it is a historical movie and you know how it ends. I still sat there being terrified wheater that bomb is gonna destory the world or not."

The film masterfully portrays the life and achievements of J. Robert Oppenheimer, shedding light on his pivotal role in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. With a thought-provoking narrative and a deep exploration of ethical dilemmas, it leaves viewers pondering the consequences of scientific discoveries. Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" is a must-see film that brilliantly captures the complexities of history and the human condition."
"The tense, examination towards the end of the movie is one of the greatest plot points of a movie I have ever seen. One minor complaint, that stops it from being a 10/10, is the explosive audio towards the opening of the film, in a particular scene with RDJ the music was so loud that it made the dialogue of the scene unclear. Emily Blunt was an absolutely incredible portrayal of Kitty Oppenheimer, especially during the examination when Dr Oppenheimer is questioned with regards to his relationship with Jean the known communist, The movie moves at an absolutely beautiful pace, and did not feel like a 3 hour movie at all. A true masterpiece. In my opinion, this is a contender for the greatest film we will ever see. Nolan deserves praise."
"Actors did a great job, visuals were great and it was about important subject matter. I did NOT like the disjointed storyline and it felt like they left out so much of Oppenheimer's actual story. We see him at college and then at his great Atomic bomb building level. Story alludes to his greatness but not why. Also left out his wife's bio completely and in real life he got grief for that. Timelines were wonky too... made story hard to follow. Oh and they completely left out pearl harbor and the pivot to bombing Japan vs the original idea to use it on Hitler. Was also very long....they had ample time to tell the story but it was shown as more of a collage of times and events. Was it worth a watch? I think so. If only to bring up the conversation and go home and research everything. Cillian's portrayal was great tho...acting in this was really superb and believable."
"Wasn't a fan, American military propaganda at it's finest. The struggle between ego and morality wasn't developed enough & the human impact of nuclear warfare was told in in the most egotisical way.The acting was good but I was not invested in the characters. The Oppenheimer characterisation feels one dimensional compared to what I imagine the real one would be like but the acting of this character I can't fault.Cinematography, dialogue & atmosphere was good but I didn't find it emotionally riveting as it felt too much like propaganda. The glorification of the military industrial complex. Apart from the occasional jarring sounds I liked the cuts between scenes and the use of black and white as it helped with the storytelling.The internal psychological struggle of Oppenheimer in evaluating the implications of his work and the realisation of the impact of his creation would have been much more interesting to explore rather than the way he was backstabbed. I wanted to be inside Oppenheimers brilliant but conflicted & devastated mind more. What it's like to have three centuries of scientific innovation become a tool for global warfare? What's the psychological impact of realising your contribution towards that?They forwent the true tragedy of the human impact that nuclear warfare has. They mentioned the death tolls in Japan and there was the skin melting off from the American audience but it felt like it was trying to tell a good story rather than be a deep psychological insight in to the mind of Oppenheimer. Little empathy for the Japanese experience.What I was hoping for was a deeper psychological exploration into how one of the most brilliant minds of our times, well aware of the devastating impact that nuclear weapons can have on the world, intellectually and morally justifies his involvement & then their inevitable development. It didn't delve deep enough on this but chose to focus the last third of the movie on the faux hearing, political backstabbing and how he was treated.With any high technology it can be a double edged sword, used to empower or enslave. Perhaps Oppenheimer believed in the development of nuclear fission as a fossil free, clean energy source. It is doubtful that the only application he could think of was an atomic bomb, but then again he was well aware of who he was commissioned by. Instead we get a one dimensional story.To me it didn't live up to its potential & I was counting down the time. Technically decent I just wasn't moved. If you like war movies then you might like it. If you want a deep philosophical, psychological thriller, a deep insight in to the human condition, this isn't it. Maybe I should have watched Barbie instead."
This movie is a master piece through and through. Not one part of it was bad. This movie single handedly is the best one that's come out in years since covid slammed the movie industry into the dirt. There's been disappointment after disappointment in the years since its ended. This movie is not that though. The entire story is told in full detail without leaving out any of it in a perfectly easy way to follow. The sound track was also amazing in this. This entire movie will single handedly be the best some of these actors and the director ever took part in. It's also my strong opinion that anyone that says it was bad is a dumb as idiot that probably has no interest in history.
"Went last weekend to the theaters to watch this movie of Christopher Nolan. And as espected; it did not disappoint. The dialogue, actors, editing, sets... it's all on point. Sure there will be some people who will have something to say about the accuracy of the historical events, but I think Nolan did an amazing job to show the most important things in just three hours. The only thing that bottered me for real; I could not hear a single word of the Dutch phrases Cillian spoke; even though I'm a dutchman. It was more like german. But who cares, it's just a little detail.What I mostly like about this film is the question that Nolan gives you to think about. Sure it is a kind of entertainment and a lesson for mankind, but the way the movie ends (with that brilliant deadstare of Cillian) was really something to consider. After this scene, the theater was completely silence for about 30-60 seconds. Everyone remained quite and sitting to rethink the deep lessons of this movie.I'm pretty sure this movie will get the necessary awards, but I would really like to some oscars for both Cillian as RDJ. Both nailed it.For me; best movie I've seen so far in the theaters."
"Wow what a movie, the way oppenheimer's story has been told is commendable, OP's becoming an atomic bomb and later his inner state has been portrayed in a very good way and Cillian Murphy's acting is excellent. Christopher Nolan's direction is wonderful, the way he has presented the story, two or three layers run together in the movie and all meet together in the end. Some scenes of the film will shock you, especially the bomb trial scene, in which there is silence on the screen, but the expression of the actor and the audience itself can feel the explosion. Everyone must watch this movie once, such a film would never have been made."
"This is an attempt to condense what occurred in a reverent teenage mind, over the course of 180 minutes sat in a cinema theatre (with no seat left empty) witnessing Oppenheimer. I doubt it shall do any justice to the emotions elicited in my own viewing, and I encourage those who read, to see for oneself independent of my own perspectives.ART
Nolan's choice of dividing the movie, splitting it, into scenes of colour and black and white did appear to me, prior to viewing, as an attempt to raise this film to an artistic standard it would not hold upon viewing. I must admit to being incorrect in my predisposition. This choice to divide the colour in the film between monochrome and technicolour is perhaps as useful as it is impressionistic. Not only does it enable the viewer to chronicle the timeline of the film simply, but also present a different theatre, a more complex theatre, to the one the first two parts of the film present. It serves as a useful distinction to the eye, as well as the mind. Where Oppenheimer deals initially with the theatre of science, of creation, of morals, the closing black-and-white post-climax of the film serves to deliver the sickening witch-hunt in the theatre of politics, of immovable institutions, of what shall be called for the rest of this review, the American Justification.AMERICA
I will try to define this term now: and I am sure it will be insufficient to portray what I truly believe it to be, in simply, insufficient words. I believe the American Justification is, put in a pretty, concise words, the ability of 'America' to perpetuate not only its physical existence, but also its image and symbolism by means of justifying itself on the basis of its simple existence and continuation of the 'American way'. Nolan expresses this most beautifully - via his presentation of the aged, the suited, the decrepit, the congruous, the white (ethnically, yes), and their assault on any form of progress that does not follow the route of the American Justification. This path, based purely on opinion and my own personal viewership, is that of winning. And I think winning is different to victory. Victory is a discriminate end goal, while winning is the process, as well as the end goal, if it is ever reached. The story of Oppenheimer is the epitome of the American desire to win, and to never stop winning. Oppenheimer is ultimately persecuted for his delays to American winning. His doubts over the moral credibility of the development of an H-bomb does not coalesce with the American ideal of always winning, of always being ahead.However, trying to root myself from disappearing into ideals and politics, and whichever way the our world's current political climate turns, I should return to what is upon the screen, what is evident. I shall begin with perhaps the most appalling scene in the film, for me at least, marking one of the six times I moved to tears during the film, and one of the seven times I was moved to tears over the duration of the whole experience of my evening. This scene, to place in context, is after the two A-bombs produced in Los Alamos have been detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki to end World War II. We see Cillian Murphy troubled, his name, endearingly shortened to 'Oppy' being chanted by the residents of Los Alamos, calling for his speech in celebration. Perhaps this is pinnacle of the film, to me at least. He walks through his neighbours, haunted by the train-like chugging of their stamping on the wooden boards they are seated upon. If one has watched David Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive' they will pick up on the lighting in this scene. It is shadowy, dark. The wood of the hall is rich, blooming, wet. The faces of those cheering are dark, almost zombified. 'Oppy' stands before his congregation and delivers Americanized sentiments that he does not believe, receiving uproar in applause and cheer and laughter. Here, Nolan cleverly paints Oppenheimer's own fission, his division of his ideals. In this haunting scene we witness the devouring of guilt, airbrushed over by victory, by the cessation of WWII. The zombified Americans feed off the decay of 110,000 dead (initially, 250,000 in the weeks continuing) in the two Japanese cities to fuel their arms to wave small American flags, and to fill their lungs for whoops and cheers. This scene is haunting even before Oppy's visions, where everything becomes muted, and he finds himself stepping through the heart of a burnt husk of one of his bomb's victims. Everything is engulfed in light, everything is swallowed by American victory, the idea of which is on par with divinity. Oppy exits, witnessing some crying, some embracing, all joyous, as well as a couple kissing under the seats, and one of his physicists throwing up outside of the hut. He witnesses all the putridity of America's pulp culture. Americanization devours the intellectual achievement of the creation of such a device, commercialising and lowering it to the level of beer-sodden, vomit-inducing, homecoming partying and cheer. Mass violence is Americanly justified under the guise of winning. Cruelty, gruesomeness, guilt is all admonished by the positive result of victory.CHARACTERS
I feel that now is an opportune moment to depart from the greater ideals that are tackled in the film, and to address the minutiae, of each of the roles tackled by Nolan's stellar cast. Damon plays an intimidating chalk to Oppenheimer's cheese, a shouty, but informed and sympathetic, army general overseeing Los Alamos. The only time his allyship to Oppy, to the audience, is questioned, is in the confined cabinet prosecution room. Blunt plays all but a blunt character, pardoning the pun. Kitty, Oppenheimer's wife, serves a tasteful discord to Oppenheimer's arrogance. To all that he is blind, Kitty is witness to. Blunt's delicate portrayal of Kitty is equally able to be hated and admired by the audience. Her testimony within the cabinet room is a moment of the film where the audience can truly smile. Oppy's science team are perfectly measured, credit to the actors or script writing I do not know, but they do not intrude on the storyline too much and are equally not sidelined. Each is characterised in seconds, and playfully too. They always add the scene, each additional detail is always welcome and never overplayed. I ultimately believe that no word, no moment, is acted incorrectly. There are no times that the acting falls short or feels artificial. You receive an overwhelming sense that each actor enjoys the character that they well and truly live within, unflinchingly. Downey Jr plays a deceptively hurtful role, a political animal. His rupture from his initial portrayal is a betrayal to the audience. We feel deceived, we feel hurt. We feel that we were misfed a character who was simply a fake, and phony, concealing a vain, power-hungry man who aims to succeed and hold control. Cillian Murphy must be mentioned for his role. His depiction of Oppenheimer is not only deeply nuanced, paired with the nuanced characterisation of him by narrative voice throughout the film, he balances Oppy's genius, brilliance and intelligence with his blue-eyed blindness, his naivety. He is flawed, and truly lovable, truly admirable. His impression on the audience is always poignant and touching. His ability to act in silence is as incredible as his ability to deliver lines. He could walk back into the second world war and play Oppenheimer himself.A BIOPIC? A 'PEOPLE' FILM
A striking feature of the film that dawned on me during the cinema walk-home, is how the film is focused. Oppenheimer is a departure from modern filmmaking style: it did help that I watched a 35mm millimetre screening, which removed some HD nature to the viewing, but instilled in it an artistic imperfectness. Nolan chooses not to focus on CGI, on visual spectacle, and while he does not shy away from it completely, his lens it focused on the human, on the being. More shots focus on the eyes, the faces, the bodies, the physicality, the voices, the clothes, the gazes and the actions of those in Oppenheimer than the A-bomb. It is ultimately a film of people, not of explosions, which gives it a great emotional touch. Nolan examines the value of exploring the effect upon the psyche, upon the emotions, upon the relations of people, rather than pure destruction. In fact, Nolan chooses to end upon creation rather than destruction. Avoiding straying into biblical allusions, of which there are many in the 180 minutes, Nolan chooses to instead focus on beginning, rather than ending. WWII is not ended by the A-bomb, instead, the atomic era, the H-bomb race, the age democratic hostility is begun.CONCLUSION
The film is ultimately about fission. Ha-Ha, funny joke, he's trying to be a fancy artistic reviewer. I encourage you to watch, and you shall see, how each ideal, each person, each story explored in this masterpiece is ripped apart, atomised, before the audience. Oppy's communist ideals dissolve and split, ultimately his allegiances to humanity remain, but are smothered by American capitalism and reverent fear of all things Left. Our physicists' relationships with one another are pulled to pieces, and rejoined momentarily by phony formality of a handshake, between Oppenheimer and Teller.America is split apart. We see an admirable, heroic hunger for academic progression, reduced to greed, and its lust for success and power. I wait for what Nolan has for us next but doubt it will ever be able to succeed his statement that is Oppenheimer. He tackles not only a biopic of such a complex character, but a timeless reincarnation of a time of politics and tension, delivering it all within a three-hour film that will leave you speechless. I encourage you, I implore you, to book your tickets for your local cinema, to experience what shall become a hallmark in cinematic history, to witness Oppenheimer."
"Thanks to the all actors and directors!Oppenheimer was full of drama and facts which leads me to live into the scenarios! I really recommended of this movie not for actions fans! You must be caution in every moment and have at least a bit background of politics.I wish there will be peace around the world especially this time when we see the news between Russia & Ukraine. Because the movie released in this time where the world in trouble a bit, so hopefully nothing getting worse.I am very happy and want to see it again but this time VIP. Murphy was more better than Tom Shelby in that film."
"This movie in my opinion is one of the best movie I have ever seen. Even at 3 hours long every scene is important to understanding who Oppenheimer is and keeps you engaged. If you know nothing about the 40s and 50s i would recommend doing a little research about the cold war, ww2 and world politics during that era just so it's easier to follow in the beginning (not necessary to enjoy the film). This is the only movie that I have seen, with zero action and still has you on the edge of your seat. The acting was absolutely incredible not just from the main characters but from every little person in the story. Cinematography is stunning as you would come to expect from a Nolan film. Overall if you love storytelling and a great film that isn't just run and gun action or superheroes then this movie will not only keep you engaged but will have you thinking and talking on the car ride home."
"The movie was very exceptional . Christopher Nolan's vision was fulfilled in this movie . The cinematography , the cgi everything was top notch . The actors in this movie , incuding Cillian Murphy ,Emily Blunt , Robert Downey Jr, everyone gave their best efforts . Ad a science student , the actual physics terms in this movie seemed a bit basic but perfect nonetheless .Cillian Murphy , espescially , was perfect for the role of Oppenheimer . Him depicting Oppenheimer's agony as he gave a peech to the people and during the trials was exceptional . Overall the movie was very well made , with every single small detail in mind . I have tried to keep this review as spoiler free as possible , but i think i have written only the basic things ."
"Oppenheimer is a delight as good cinema. From the performances of Murphy and Downey Jr., Damon and Malik, to the staging, they give the film a pace that doesn't slow down in its 3 hours, at times conveying the feeling of being overwhelmed by their characters. Nolan proves to be very solid in the biographical genre, showing in great detail one of the most iconic and thorny moments of the entire 20th century. Definitely an important historical document; a film to show in schools and reflect on how the start of this arms race marks a before and after in geopolitics and how our actions, however altruistic, sometimes have unsuspected consequences."
"Sure, this was an interesting movie. It is about a significant, historical character who was instrumental in changing the world. His story is important and should be told. The all-star cast showed up, performing to their expected levels. I particularly enjoyed Matt Damon's character, Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. He was a hard-nosed, witty, no nonsense, Pattonesque general. I learned some things about the development of the atom bomb that I didn't know previously. The cinematography and the movie period atmosphere were authentic enough, however, I was not as blown away by the film as I expected to be. There were many characters, names, story lines that were a bit befuddling at times, taking awhile to learn them all. The way the movie went back and forth in at least three different periods of Oppenheimer's atomic bomb development endeavor, which involved sections of black and white filming, then going back to another period in color, was at times, somewhat discombobulating. The movie was also 1/2 - 1 hour too long. I think the same story could've been told in a shorter period of time. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the movie, but it did not strike emotion in me as some of my favorites have. I'm sure the academy will love it. I'm just not ready to give it Best Picture - yet."
"The problem with Christopher Nolan movies is, that no matter the premise, people will always enter the theatre with incredibly (and sometimes unrealistically) high expectations. I don´t think, many people would get overly excited about watching a 3 hour biopic about Robert Oppenheimer, but put Christopher Nolans name on it and it becomes one of the biggest blockbusters of the year. I am a huge Nolan fan as well but tried to limit my excitement as much as possible, remembering very well that in 2020, I left Tenet kind of disappointed because of my unrealitstically high expectations - even though it was overall a very good movie (after the second viewing that is). For Oppenheimer, it didn´t make it easier, that movie theatres were immediately sold out for days and initial critics (even the ones that were not generated by Chat GPT) were showering it with praise. I finally managed to get a seat in a rather small theatre tonight and have to say: Even with neutral expectations, this movie was a disappointment.Don´t get me wrong, with a 100 Million dollar budget, it will obviously still provide you with incredible imagery, flawless acting, a great soundtrack (there is a BUT! Though) and an original story that still manages to give you a blockbuster feeling, something that has become very rare in Hollywood these days. But I will still not watch it again. Here´s why:Christopher Nolan movies have often stood out from the crowd, due to 1. Big spectacle, that was held together by 2. An emotional story at its core, with 3. Some kind of twist considering the narrative structure. Oppenheimer completely neglects the emotional part and tries but fails to deliver on both the spectacle (with one obvious exception) and the narrative complexity. The narrative device of telling the story over three different timelines delivers one (maybe two) exciting twists at the very end but otherwise almost feels like Christopher Nolan just HAD to use different time periods because...that´s his thing. Telling the story through retrospective court hearings is not new and most of the scenes do not really add anything. The Social Network for example did a much better job of incorporating this narrative device. If you are expecting big spectacle, you have to be aware that 95% of this movie is pure dialogue. There´s nothing wrong with that per se, but Nolan has never been famous for his great dialogue writing skills (except for some memeable Joker quotes I guess) and this movie is no exception in that regard. There are like 5 witty one-liners (most of which already given away in the trailer), the rest is basically characters explaining the different plot points to each other (minor exceptions apply). The spectacle is provided by the Nuclear bomb explosion scene and I am not gonna lie, this scene is spectacular and very satisfying to watch, amplified by the fact that the almost 120 minutes leading up to it have been very underwhelming (more about that in a second). Nolan reportedly was very proud of this scene, being shot completely without CGI, which is undeniably an incredible cinematic achievement, but if you are expecting to be blown away (pun intended) by a 150 minutes visual, action-packed extravaganza ala Inception, the dark knight, or Tenet, be aware that this is a completely different movie. The emotional component is completely absent, the relationship between Oppenheimer and his wife is reduced to maybe 10 minutes of shared screentime, with Kitty Oppenheimer being a voice of reason and concern about Mr. Oppenheimers scientific, political and romantic endeavours, and him barely reacting to it. Oppenheimers affair and the rather unfortunate ending to it is also not given enough screen time to have any emotional impact on the viewer. All of the other characters (except Lewis Strauss) are mainly reduced to Cameos anyway, without any insight into their emotional site whatsoever. Which brings me to the main point, why this movie fails:For the first 120 minutes, up until the nuclear explosion, the movie has NO ACTUAL SCENES. I´m sure I´m not the only one, who occasionally gets stuck on youtube, browsing multiple, 3-4 minutes long clipped out scenes of my favorite movies. I dare you to try clipping out memorable scenes of the first two hours of Oppenheimer. It is an impossible task. No scene can actually breathe, it is a just constant cutaway of Oppenheimer meeting a certain character, sharing 10 seconds of dialogue, moving on to the next location, the next character, the next scenery, the next ""plotpoint"", with dramatic music CONSTANTLY playing in the background, trying to create an artificial sense of urgency. In the beginning, I thought this would be just to get through the first stations of Oppenheimers life quickly before the actual plot can kick off, until it dawned on me, that the whole movie is cut that way. What doesn´t help is the neverending CAMEO parade of A-list Hollywood actors, that makes you wonder ""oh wow, what are they going to do with this character?"", before you realize that you will most likely never see him again. In that sense, the atomic bomb explosion scene is a huge relief, because the movie finally STOPS. Takes its time to develop a scene. Shows characters emotions. When the music stops for these couple of seconds, I even breathed out a sigh of relief. And after this scene, the movie actually takes a turn for the better. The scene of Oppenheimer mentally checking out in front of a cheering crowd is great. The meeting with Truman scene is great. Even the final congressional hearing scenes and a few of the final court testimonies are great. Because Nolan finally takes some time to develop some actual character interactions, instead of just rushing over them. The ending scene is great. But if the first two hours of the movie are rushed, a good (but also not perfect) last hour can´t really save it. At least not for me. For me, this is by far Nolans most disappointing film, but even if it had been done by a different director, I still would not consider it to be a good film. So if you are craving a blockbuster, that does not contain superheroes, video game characters or toys, jump onto the hypetrain and watch it, but if someone asked me for a list of 200 movie reccommendations, Oppenheimer would probably not be on it. 5/10."
"Everything in this movie is amazing. The acting is near perfection with Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon and countless others. Cillian Murphy's performance in particular is sure to be Oscar winning with how he portrays Robert Oppenheimer so well. The writing of this film will keep you wanting more and more out of this film. Even if you are a Marvel fan were you want to see constant action you will still be on your seat at each moment. The music only adds to this only much more with the music being on par with Interstellar. You will be watching this movie and be completely sub directed of the film by each quaking moment. I can't think of a dull moment in this film. This is easily one of Cristopher Nolan's best movies with it easily reaching his top three and debatably reaching top two. You can feel the atomic bomb detonation and with every sound you can feel and almost feel like you're there. The cinematography also has to be mentioned where you cannot deny at how good it is. You will be leaving the theater jaws dropped at the ending. And I must mention that you will not feel the runtime at all. The first two hours go by so fast you will want to do it over and over again and the last hour you just wish it to be longer and forever."
"Oppenheimer is a 3hrs long movie but there was not a single second where i felt bored. The music gave me ""GOOSEBUMPS"". Most of people are planning to see this movie just for the explosion, but if you are one of those people then you would be dissapointed. The movie is about ""THE MOST IMPORTANT MAN"" of history. Most of the time in the movie there will be conversations and conversations but it didn't bore me bescause I was not there just to watch the explosion but i was there to know how J. Robert Oppenheimer's life, How broken he was after he saw the power of his creation and in simple words the movie Oppenheimer is ""FLAWLESS""."
"The acting, cinematography, musical score, editing, everything about this film was flawless. This is the culmination of Christopher Nolan's life's work. This will be one of those movies that everyone has in their top 10 list. RDJ, Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt lead an allstar cast that don't miss many spots in the telling of their story. Such an immense era in the history of our nation's military development amidst the the changing global landscape of physics needed this level of acting. Even in the scenes that were simply story building dialoge, the weight of the moment could be felt by the viewer. A masterpiece from start to finish."
"The movie is a masterpiece. You can feel the character's difficulties and the storms blowing inside him deeply and sincerely. I saw the movie in IMAX and if you had told me it was a horror movie I wouldn't have objected. Albert Einstein was handled very well and the connection between what Openheimer said to him in the last scene and the first scene was perfect and fascinating. Personally, I felt Openheimer's regret even in myself. Chillian Murphy did a great job and even the supporting actors in the movie were Oscar-worthy. After leaving the movie, I questioned life for about 15 minutes in the corridor of the cinema and I felt the same feeling even at home. A movie that will stay with you for a long time after watching it. Classic Christopher Nolan Thank you."
"I was at the premiere of the movie and it was amazing! I want to thank the entire team that worked on this movie, you guys are really cool! In the film everything was on the highest level, the cast, cinema, musical accompaniment, plot, sound, in one word everything! Throughout the film, he keeps the viewer in some tension, as if you are experiencing all the emotions that Oppenheimer himself experienced.Watching these movies makes you realize how much the human brain can do. One can create nuclear weapons, and one can create a genius film, and the third (as I) sit to admire the first two! )))"
The soundtracks in this film are more than creative. The quality is at the peak of beauty. Verbal dialogues with music in you beauty. The characters in the movie are wonderful. Cillian Murphy is very creative. Soundtracks in this film are more than creative. The quality is at the peak of beauty. Verbal dialogues with music in you beauty.

"This movie is one of the greatest movies that have been released in the last 10 years. I don't remember the last time I watched a great movie in the cinema. The great movies that got released the last couple years were either banned from cinema in my region or I haven't had a chance to see it in cinema.When I say Oppenheimer is a masterpiece I mean it, but you can see many people see otherwise. The reason of that is because many people now don't prefer this kind of movies. In addition, I would like to point that this a movie, so it shows the director's point of view not what happened exactly. Furthermore, this movie, as it says in its title, is about Dr. Oppenheimer not WW2 and not what unfortunately happened in Japan."
I've never seen a movie this good in YEARS I thought theaters were dead but this saved that this was so amazing it made me sit there for a good minutes loves the acting the sound track and everything else about this movie it was honestly so great it made me happy that movies like this still existed the lead actor was really just perfect it made get chills it was like I felt his emotions and don't forget the other actors they were olso amazing and they all made the movie a 10 and the blast was realistic the delay and the hit gave me goosebumps Christopher Nolen did a amazing job on this movie he has never let me down and never will.
"It's a partial biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer, who helped with the theoretical research for the atomic bomb and led the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, New Mexico. It's set from the mid-1920s to 1958 in many places, with the most significant time in Los Alamos.J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is portrayed in a jumbled timeline that touches on his early scientific education, his political interests and relationships, the influential women in his life, his interactions with a vast array of scientists in the development of the atomic bomb, the post-war controversy aroused by his political sympathies and family relationships, and his reflections on the implications of the nuclear bomb for humanity.The most important figures who relate to Oppenheimer in the film include Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), Kitty Puening Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt), General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) of the Manhattan Project, Commissioner Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.) of the Atomic Energy Commission, and Edward Teller (Benny Safdie). Other prominent historical figures like Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) and Harry Truman (Gary Oldman) make cameo appearances, as do many scientists.""Oppenheimer"" is a compelling movie. My favorite scenes were Kitty Oppenheimer refusing to shake Edward Teller's hand late in the film and Harry Truman's brusque treatment of Oppenheimer and his demand that they ""don't let that crybaby in the door again"" after Oppenheimer raised concerns. The film brilliantly portrays Oppenheimer's complex personality. Unfortunately, almost everyone else is an incomplete character. The movie is overproduced with a few valuable gimmicks and too many that are simply distracting. The time lapse between the flash of the first test explosion and the sound reaching the scientists a short distance away was silly. And I doubt Oppenheimer climbed to a high platform to examine the bomb in a suit and tie.Some characters seem exaggerated, as is wont to happen in such biopics. Lewis Strauss's villainy seems overdrawn, especially since his failure to get a cabinet seat occurred years after the conflict with Oppenheimer. John F. Kennedy's vote as a senator against Strauss joined 56 other Democrats.Still, ""Oppenheimer"" is well worth seeing. It raises good questions about nuclear weapons and the meaning of international arms races. Oppenheimer's final words are not optimistic."
"Except Dunkirk ,
i am a die hard fan of Christopher Nolan . But this one was definitely going as the worst movie of Nolan. I get it it's a biographical drama . But I was never emotionally connected to any character , never invested in any character . Because if that this was one of the most boring movie i have ever watched in theaters.The score was good ,the acting was ok ,not that great and the script was too bad. Who cares about Oppenheimer's security clearance .If they are making it a biography ,then the most important part is the audience connecting with the characters ,but that never happened with this movie."
"Always in the hallmark of a Nolan-style film, the setting is made magnificently and beautifully and adds cinema value. The sound of this film is amazing. The way the time is placed in this film makes this film more complicated than usual films. Overall, I am very satisfied with this film. Maybe this movie is the best movie i've ever watched so far. The IMAX format makes it extraordinary. Maybe a slight drawback is that there are too many facts that happen in one minute and it keeps hitting the audience's brain, but maybe that's what Nolan wants to emphasize on the audience, namely a sense of complexity, confusion, anxiety, reflecting Oppenheimer's regret after what happened in Japan. Truly cinema. Really masterpiece. Salute to the director, director, cast and crew."
"""Oppenheimer "" is definitely another masterpiece with the combination of sentimental history event, brilliant performances ,marvelous storytelling.Great timing to relate Oppenheimer's complicated feelings about being satisfied and proud or guilty of the invention.Been Cillian Murphy ' s fan and this is breathtaking cast which for sure be the Oscar nominee.I love how the storyline takes you to the route that how Science, Humanity , Love , Politics, Ego, ... crossed.Thank you Christopher Nolan and the team for bringing us the opportunity to enjoy another unforgettable and remarkable movie."
"Oppenheimer is a sweeping and ambitious film that tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientist who led the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb. The film is directed by Christopher Nolan, who brings his signature visual style to the project. The film is also notable for its large ensemble cast, which includes Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., and Rami Malek.Oppenheimer is a challenging film, but it is also a rewarding one. The film is not afraid to tackle complex and controversial subjects, and it does so in a way that is both thought-provoking and suspenseful. The film is also beautifully shot and features some of the most impressive special effects of the year.Cillian Murphy gives a tour-de-force performance as Oppenheimer. Murphy captures the scientist's brilliance, his charisma, and his inner turmoil. The supporting cast is also excellent, with standout performances from Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey Jr.Oppenheimer is a film that will stay with you long after you have seen it. It is a film that is both challenging and rewarding, and it is a film that will make you think about the nature of science, the power of technology, and the responsibility of scientists.Overall, Oppenheimer is a masterpiece. It is a film that is both challenging and rewarding, and it is a film that will stay with you long after you have seen it. I highly recommend it."
"This is a film to be watched many times. So many layers intertwined to majestically compose a perfect description of Oppenheimer's life,inside out. The guilt. The genius. The lover. The rational. The success yet the deep dark feeling that said success generated. The politics. The effects of an idiot with power. The loyalty and the treason. All of this about one of the most important moments in human history. How can you combine all these in a single film? Certainly Nolan had the answer, along with brilliant actors that bring to the audience a living sensation as if it would be a real life experience."
"There are movies that transcend mere entertainment, and ""Oppenheimer"" is undoubtedly one of them. Directed by the brilliant Christopher Nolan, this three-hour masterpiece is a breathtaking display of pure art, paying a splendid modern tribute to the grandeur of Hollywood's golden era. Nolan's craftsmanship is at its pinnacle, complemented by a 5-star cast featuring Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt.Cillian Murphy's portrayal of the troubled and complex character, Robert Oppenheimer, is an exceptional achievement and his best performance to date. With ease, Murphy makes Oppenheimer remarkably relatable to the audience, tracing his journey from a young, uncertain man to an accomplished scientist who would reshape the course of history.Special mention to the performances of Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss and Matt Damon as General Groves, both of whom add depth and intensity to the narrative.I'd also like to salute Nolan's commitment to historical accuracy, purposefully avoiding CGI to render the experience as realistic as possible, despite minor blemishes (like the appearance of a incorrect American flag.)Ludwig Göransson's work on the film's soundtrack is a standout aspect, adding an emotional dimension to the film and making the experience truly unforgettable.Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" is another cinematic masterpiece by Nolan that deserves every accolade and recognition it receives. This film is a testament to the power of cinema, and is already solidifying its place among the all-time greats in the history of cinema."
"The main point one comes away with from Oppenheimer is that humanity isn't ready to have the power it possesses and its just a matter of time until we blow ourselves up in nuclear annihilation. Sadly, this film is timed perfectly as we are now fearing a nuclear armed Russia as well as other rogue countries. A phrase comes to mind, before you asked if you should, you did. Oppenheimer is a deep movie, lot's is going on. Be sure and know what you are getting into. It's a brilliant film, but it's not for everyone. Cillian Murphy will win best actor, Nolan best director, Blount best female actor and a score of other awards will go to this film. This movie is an experience, much like 2001 is an experience. I will probably see it again very soon."
"TBH I really surprised with Nolan's 1st Time Writing. Apart from Objective Scenes, Nolan Wrote Subjective scenes in a good manner with some Dark Humors. Especially the convo bw Oppie n Einstein and Oppie n Leslie during end and start of the film vice versa. Music made me rumble during 1st test and football basement meet. Now to the main plot Cinematography. It's Usual Thing for Nolan films to be with Good Cinematography. This is no exception. The Portrait individual shots, top angled shots are really came out well. Few frames are worth to be the wallpapers. For example, Green apple spilling with poison, Cillian's Zoomed in shots, Los Alamos and especially my favorite Pugh's cornered shot hugging Cillain during 2nd sex scene. I felt 2 issues with Cinematography. 1st one an in and out in Portrait shots. I don't know why it happened but O don't think they done it purposely. 2nd is scaling. We are not gonna see the real blast in film. Only the test bombing only shot in the film. But we couldn't measure the range of the blast since there is no any nearby objects. And Finally the the performance. As usual Cillian, Matt and RDJ Nailed their roles. I felt some pleasure in heart whenever I saw Conti as Einstein. Blunt gave a notable performance. Pugh's role is not lengthy as the 85%+ of film moving to the main content. Since it's a Biopic you may face some slowness in Screenplay where I'm okay with it."
"Oppenheimer (the film not the guy) communicates some very complicated scientific ideas simply to allow them to be surrounded in the main message of the film, questioning the morality of the entire project and the persons involved. It is written extremely well.The editing of Oppenheimer may be my favourite part, Jennifer Lame chose to make frequent cuts to abstract snippets of the future to convey the noise in Oppenheimer's head. This is followed by the understanding of the confusion later on the film - as the story slowly unravells - creating a very satisfying viewing experience, one of constantly learning the reasons behind his actions and getting a better understanding of the man the films centers around.The film does have occasional slow and potentially confusing moments, however like some of the best films, everything is made clear, previous secrets giving the viewer an almost complete understanding by the end of the film.If you like science I would definitely recommend it.Overall, the film is extremely high quality in every aspect, not afraid to make more outlandish artistic decisions like shooting large segments of the film in black and white."
"I enjoyed the film, I knew a little bit about the Manhattan project but not much and I now feel I've learnt something historically and also in the very here and now which is scary. A very talented roster of actors with some cameos and brilliant performances from both Murphy and Downey Jr, I hated the latter in this film which just proves how good he is as I love him in most of his films. But I can't help but feel it was disjointed flicking back and forth between before, during and after. Other than the 2 mentioned actors the other characters don't make much of an impact, I felt like I'd watched about 4 genres rolled into 1 and there wasn't enough in about the actual bomb itself. Interesting film but it felt as if the different aspects of the storyline were all competing with each other as opposed to bringing the main focus of the film together. Not my favourite Nolan film."
"The history of story is truly fascinating! Yet the movie is drab, unexciting and stays at the same level of uninterst the whole way through the movie.Too much focus was placed past events that had no value to the story. And then once the bombs were actually made, all we get to see is them being shipped away in crates to be used at Hiroshima & Nagasaki, yet we are shown zero wartime footage & we dont see the fallout and deaths caused by the biggest bombs the world has ever seen.Also the high age rating ONLY comes because of the pointless nude sex scenes.Alot of big names failed to excite us."
"Best biopic I've ever seen
The best thing about the movie is the sound effects and sound engineering
Of course, the photography is awesome, especially since even black and white is captured using iMax technologyDirector Christopher Nolan did not let us down, even though he changed the type of films that we are used to and fascinate us
But he didn't changed his wonderful way of narrating events
I was sure I would come out happy from the movie
But I didn't imagine that I would reach this degree of happiness
Advice before you watch the movie, you must know who Oppenheimer is
You can search for it
And in an episode of Al-Dahih program, speaking about Oppenheimer
Really clarified a lot of events
But if you do not know the story or are expected to watch Nolan's usual films, I would like to tell you that you will not understand anything."
"I rarely talk or write reviews on movies, but I can't stress how much I love this movie.The way it manipulated emotions within me, I could feel it, I could feel and understand what Oppenheimer feels, even though I was not him, I felt that I myself was merely him in the way he was narrated in major moments of the movie. What my eyes saw was absorbed all the way inside to creat a gleam within my mind, and that gleam illuminated back through my eyes, This is what I love this movie.It was a very well written biography in the first place, but Nolan took it to the next level. The emphasis on what it means to be prometheus. Although Nolan only mentioned the story of Prometheus only once in the first minute of the movie, you could see the embodiment of the character in Oppenheimer; the moment where he was horrified to see the power he brought to humanity, while people around him celebrated the moment, he knew it could've been put in a better use, but he also knew it is a human nature to strive in using power in exchange to become evil. Oppenheimer only acted upon what humans requested, even though he had a will, he carried a dream, but he would've never make his dreams come true so he proved it through benefiting people's desires, exchangeable benefits in a way. Until you see Prometheus, until he feels abandoned after he gave humans what they needed from him, Cillian Murphy's acting skills were out of this world, he made sure all his emotions were vividly felt, how was he alienated right after he accomplished his mission, he the power he created was taken away and put to use right when it was proven to be as evil as it was promised. Even when he was celebrated in the crowd, and when he was asked to give a speech, he knew he could never say that never wanted this, he could only flatter about it about it and say what the crowd wanted to hear, I could see the embodiment of Prometheus vividly in that moment which was very amusing to see especially as a literature lover.The entirety of the movie was an experience to be put in a humans own biography. It is an experience that makes a human discover places he never touched in his emotions, a different type of emotions that we as human have forever thought we knew and understood perfectly, until this movie came and shattered all of that. As it promised to do."
"What is good:
The movie has great storylines. Mr. Nolan is the master in story telling. I was never feeling bored during the 3 hr movie. The flashback combine with black/white and color scene tells great stories. For someone who is interested in the WW2 history, this movie is a must to recommend.What is not good enough:
The depict of Straus as the con-man in my view is a fail. Straus is just a microcosm of the macro McCarthyism culture that has been rampant during that time. I would love to see Straus, who is a controversial character in American history, to be also fighting for his ideology instead of just revenging on a small argument. This further signifies how ideology tears apart society and nobody can escape."
"I learned a lot about the basics if this event.Scenario : I learned a lot about how the methodology ans the path on building the H bomb, the morals this building would discuss internationnally, I learned which people met whom at that era and what were the consequences of the H bomb building.Aestethic angle : The photography of the movie wasn't forgotten as we could feel the beauty of the colors. The sounds développée for the movie and the choice to mute some scene are important as this is the best way to feel the explosion of bomb in a movie...then came the sounds of the explosion as the thunders work.Movie soundtrack : It was a good enough music to be spotted by movie soundtrack lovers' ears, I sure shall listen to it again !"
"Nolan delivers a gadget of profound intellectually provocative weight, slaps it upon the minds of the audience and compels them to implode their moral preconceptions upon the nature of power, love and humanity. A true biographical film which latches upon the eyes of J. Robert Oppenheimer; revealing the troubles that come with ""vison beyond this world."" In my personal view, Julius Robert Oppenheimer is a flawed individual: conceited, arrogant, stubborn in his vast intellect, to the extent that his devotion to science and advancement of scientific theory clouds his intrinsic morals. The protagonist is portrayed as logical, with ample ability for reasonable foresight in matters of the political and philosophical impact of his actions, but continues to deceive himself of the moral implications of his ""gadget."" This man knew in his heart of hearts the results of his theory,
fully aware of the eventual display of power and threat of mutually assured destruction in the future. Nolan humanizes a genius of universal proportions, revealing that in-depth understanding of quantum phenomena (or any physical science) does not equate to emotional intelligence, nor basic human empathy."
"Oppenheimer is probably up there with one of the best films I've seen... in a very long time. The feeling you have through the whole 3 hours is gargantuan - it leaves you feeling sad and scared throughout. The quick edited scenes, the feeling of dread in every scene, with the use of intense music and sound. It was most definitely did not feel like a 3 hour movie. The pacing is just right, the blend of the storyline, from start to finish is like a loud and finely tuned machine. Probably my favourite Nolan film to date. I'm sure others will think Nolan has done better, but it's probably my personal favourite. I 100% intend going to see it again at the cinema - if you are planning on watching this, find time to watch it at the cinema, and if you can, an IMAX, this film is an experience."
"Mr Nolan never disappoints. The hype, the legacy leading up to the actual cinematic experience stands true right from the very first scene. The stark contrast, the character plays so well in the movie and is so engrossing that one will forget that this is the longest movie of Mr Nolan. The casting, the performances makes it a movie which is not to be missed if you are even if you are just a fun-viewer.Mr Nolan's dabbling into the biography genre and building up of characters, the time lapses, the dialogues are so aptly matched up with the corresponding scenes that it makes you forget that you are watching it from few metres away from the screen. This movie is an experience worth going for and it sucks you in the narrative of the two main characters in a way that while watching any other biographical genre movie will have too much expectations."
"I went to see this movie in the theatre, knowing about the Manhattan project loosely with little knowledge. It is well done, and once you sit through the first 20 minutes, the movie's ADHD back and forth makes sense. To avoid spoilers, I will mention the cinematography. There are 2 scenes that blew me away. One is the Trinity test, which faithfully and almost meticulously recreates actual filmed parts of the test and preparations for it, is bone chilling. The other scene at the end, with another person, makes a great ending, and the accompanying soundtrack almost makes you feel obligated to feel the emotions they are talking about. If possible, I would recommend seeing it in IMAX because it is actually designed for it, and I REALLY want to see it in IMAX now, even though I saw it yesterday. The only downside was the sometimes confusing story, but the overall story is understandable."
"Nolan is an excellent filmmaker and the hype surrounding this film might be why I wasn't overly impressed. The fact that it was filmed on 70mm film was a major marketing point, however the film is 99% talking, which doesn't need 70mm.The good: Acting is phenomenal by Murphy, Pugh, Blunt, and Downing. The soundtrack in itself is great. The cinematography is top tier. Even though it's 3 hours it never feels like it's dragging.The bad: The soundtrack was constantly playing over the dialogue making it hard to hear what was happening at times. The flow of the story is hard to follow because it is told non-linearly and there are several threads happening. The use of black and white film in some scenes was also a marketing point but it seemed to be used almost arbitrarily. At some points it's future events sometimes past events. Despite the runtime being 3 hours there is little growth between characters.If there had been one anchor point timeline and the rest told linearly and the score scaled back this would be one of the best movies ever made. Definitely still worth watching I just think it may have been oversold."
"The good: excellent performances by Murphy, Damon and especially Downey. A couple of powerful scenes, especially of the first test of the atom bomb - literally mind blowing .The bad: disjointed and confusing storytelling. Characters are plopped in and we have no idea who they are or their significance. Bombastic score that never lets up. At 3 hours way overlong.I was so looking forward to seeing this film, especially after the critical huzzahs for it and I'm a fan of all the talent involved. Well, folks, we've been misled by the critics yet again. Quite a few walkouts at the screening that I attended."
"This film is definitely worth watching. The cinematic experience is out of this world and makes you leave the theatre almost in the state of shock. The cast, the story and simply every aspect of this film is a masterpiece. Even though film is generally considered an art form, I have yet to encounter a film more worthy of the title of art than Oppenheimer. As I saw critics and media portraying this film at the top of the industry, I had more than high expectations and they were all met. As I was running a bit late to the cinema I didn't have enough time to buy popcorn or any snacks, which was honestly a save of money since all my focus was immediately captured when Oppenheimer showed up on the screen so I am not sure I would even be able to eat it."
"What does the film represent? A story about the manhattan project and the making of the atomic bomb, but also a detailed view into a mind which saw things not many could see. Oppenheimer shows that all along, he knew exactly what he was doing, they all knew they were building a bomb with huge destructive capabilities, yet went with it anyway. These people on the project were scientists and the film really shows that there was a fine line of morality that each one was crossing when pushing for innovation, which ultimately led to destruction. In the end, Oppenheimer never regretted what he did, he may have felt remorseful about the deaths, but Nolan captures that really he knew he was the most important man on the planet at the time and people would listen to whatever he had to say. A gentle soul, yet strong egotistical and somewhat political view on the world."
"My star rating for this movie will not be accurate because you can not put anything higher than 10. All i can say is christopher nolan is an absolute genius. The movie was incredible. I left the theater with tears in my eyes and jaw dropped to the popcorn covered floor. Still processing life after seeing this incredible masterpiece that must be placed beside the mona lisa. Scratch that, it must REPLACE the mona lisa. When a movie makes your body freeze and stop breathing you know it's good. My therapist will be pleased to hear that i'm close to finding the meaning of life after this movie. Thank you to christopher nolan and the entire cast of oppenheimer for reminding us all of what movies are meant to do."
"A hypermasculine Sofia Coppola mood piece about physics. Why not be concerned about the latest problems physics presents in the present: the huge accelerator supercollider at Cern attempts to see back to the dawn of time. The point is this: science repeats itself in everwidening circles. The brave minds of Oppenheimer offer additional potentials by expanding physics with the artistic expressions of mood, memory, and adventure. The actor Cillian Murphy is hot to look at and fun to watch in an expressive gem. Thank you Christopher Guest for writing the truth about the past present and future in a film the mass audience can process today."
"My favorite movie has always been ""Interstellar."" No other film could evoke such emotions in me as it does. Christopher Nolan's new film once again managed to bring back those feelings and sensations while watching it. When you watch ""Oppenheimer,"" you experience the entire range of emotions and sensations that a film can offer. Throughout all three hours, you'll be thrilled by the brilliance of the film, screenplay, music, visual effects, acting, directing, and cinematography. Everything is meticulously thought out and meaningful, making it exceptionally perfect and captivating. You completely immerse yourself in the film and become a part of it, living the lives of the characters, sharing their emotions. After viewing, there's a sense of fulfillment and a pleasant aftertaste. Christopher Nolan's films prompt contemplation and reflection, as they should after watching a movie. I recommend them to anyone who appreciates quality cinema, values art, and simply wants to delve into the world of great films."
"This film is the biography of the legendary Scientists Robert Oppenheimer. We saw the timeline of this film is during the second world war. How Germany is not invented the atomic bomb this film tell us the truth. Oppenheimer wife is comiunist and that's his big fault. At the end of this film we have a idea about this. This is not a tripical Nolan movie. We have see few change in it.cilian Murphy performance is superb. Robert Downey Jr role was nice portrait in this film. Sound quality was nice. In theaters the audience got goosebumps after hearing the sound. Screenplay,the dialog delivery by actor is good."
"#Oppenheimer
It's not cyclical, it's spiral. It looks like a cycle (circle) since we are accustomed to look from the top (from the position of moral superiority as it is convenient). But from the top even mushroom cloud will appeared to be a circle (if you ever survive to tell the shape of it) .It begins with Oppenheimer looking from the top at ripples of water and and it ends at the look itself. You can't hold your tear at the beauty which is quintessentially spiral in so many ways - Temporal Unity, Narrative Unity of storytelling, Philosophical Unity of observer and observed, Existential Unity of Subject and Art form and yet many more to discover.Narrative Nolan is a sage who has been endlessly penancing to harness the spirit of time. Many a times he showed the world of his own imagination in which he twisted arm of time to get whatever he wanted. He seemed to have been artist of time in his artificial world and as such it has been a question in my mind whether he can sculpt the real time, time of our shared world, time of objectivity.In true sense there has been only one sculptor of time and his name was Andrei Tarkovsky who could metamorphosis the real time into marvel block and then sculpt out the useless and gave us cinema.While looking at the IMAX screen, I was wondering how would Tarkovsky have incepted the idea in Nolan's dream that a magician of imagination was turned into a wizard of real world.Nolan is an artist for whom existential Unity comes naturally. When he picks up magic as his subject, he lays bear the structure of magic. He shows something ordinary (The pledge), then make it disappears (The turn) and then make it reappear (The prestige). And this is how he woven the very structure of magic in the storytelling : The pledge, the turn and the prestige. An onion layer is enveloped by an onion layer and which in turn enveloped by another layer. So if he one day makes a film about onions be ready to get enveloped. This is existential unity of art in my view and Nolan's soul is a platform which provide existential unity to subject and art, a platform on which Subject dances with its true art form. Oppenheimer is a paradoxical character whose existential and existence crisis both are due to the existence of something which he himself made to exist. A-bomb is the fulcrum and on the both end subjectivity of Oppenheimer and objective reality plays see-saw. Awe!! How one can not be stunned by the awe of such an existential unity.Nolan! I bow before you master."
"This is such a great and thorough telling of the history of the atomic bomb and the Manhattan project, but unlike the cold emotionless pages of a history book, it has been brought to life.We do not choose to exist, but we have an obligation to do so, I hope humanity can find the candor and courage to learn from our mistakes, not take life for granted, and strive to leave the world in a better place than we entered it.""All humanity could share a common insanity and be immersed in a common illusion while living in a common chaos. That can't be disproved, but we have no choice but to follow our senses."""
"It's not a bad film at all, but when you've got a director of Nolan's calibre at the helm, you expect more than what Oppenheimer has to offer.Many of the scenes felt way too rushed, like the actors were just trying to deliver their lines without thinking about what they were actually saying. There were also way too many scenes in general; it felt like a series of vignettes that oscillated between Oppenheimer's personal life and moral qualms, and the reverence/derision he received from those around him.The dialogue also hits you over the head a little too much, so much is made explicit through the characters' conversations that it's implausible anything resembling these interactions would've ever taken place.The acting is fantastic, Cillian Murphy absolutely nails the part, as does Emily Blunt, whose scything take-down of the interrogator towards the end is a real highlight of the film. Kenneth Branagh's performance as Niels Bohr was a head scratcher - I never knew Danes spoke with Afrikaner accents.All in all, yes it's a decent film but there's just too much going on."
"Excruciatingly long, slow and *gasp* dare I say it, boring. It's boring. The only good thing was the stacked cast of actors, it get to a point while I almost doze off, Casey affleck's voice woke me up and then yeah there he is, a surprise appearance by casey affleck yayyy. That's how bored I am.This is a passion project of Nolan, only it felt like he made it for himself and that's fine actually. Too bad I dont enjoy this movie, though another thing I do enjoy however was the score. It is mighty cinematic & beautiful, it also enhances some of the boring dialogue which otherwise would be rather bland. I've been a fan of Ludwig Goransson since Tenet & Wakanda forever.I think Nolan's name alone could made this a box office hits, however in this day where our attentions were divided upon so many things, it could prove to be detrimental for our enjoyment of the movie, maybe I couldn't enjoy this movie because my brain was used to shorter & compact contents (Tiktok is a pandora box for me) BUT in my defense, comparing this movie to Nolan's previous works, I cannot say this was superior in any means. Inception, Interstellar, Batmans, Tenet were all feast for my eyes & brain. But I pushed through to the end and I pat myself in the shoulder as I walked out of cinema.Cinematography is sub par, strory's not really engaging, the back and forth in timeline feels messy, performances was nothing special, all the actors did their job okay, and also the much hyped no cgi for the bomb sequences felt underwhelming. I agree that they dont need CGI because this is not an action movie, it's a historical biography movie whom also focuses a lot on political tension during wartime. And it wont matter much anyway, the bomb scene was just a short scene. So I guess the much hyped marketing tactic which spread around saying all of the effects was practical was actually inconsequential.Feel free to skip this one as I felt the regular nolan fans will be dissapointed. Its a historical biography drama but less emphasis on the drama."
"Awesome acting, makeup, wardrobe all over here. Loved it. Obviously king but I didn't know all of the history behind this and it taught me a lot. I'd like to see it again as I'm sure I'll catch way more nuance than the first go. Acting was fantastic and I loved how they mixed up black and white ""footage"" with the more real time color aspects. Suspenseful soundtrack as well. Literally had suspense until the last line of the movie so don't leave early. Nothing exciting in the first half of the credits, at least that I saw as I headed out. Wild historical story that changed the course of the world and beyond unfortunately."
"Oppenheimer instantly enters the discussion for best film ever made, with impecable editing, scarring music and towering performances from a solid cast. Nolan's screenplay is incisive and detailed, with enough material to make the 3 hours feel like not enough time to devour this delicious work of art. Blending the thriller and the political courthouse drama, Christopher Nolan crafted an innovative cinematic experience that's both grand but shockingly sensitive and intimate. The tension, brought to its absolute limit in what may be the most tense countdown sequence ever made, is ultimately released in a shattering revelation that feels like a bucket of ice-cold water thrown at your body in the film's final moments. This masterclass in balance of an abundance of rich elements makes Oppenheimer a thoroughly engrossing victory that makes one feel as conflicted as the man behind its title: happy to have witnessed it but disheartened by its consequence."
"Oppenheimer is a thought-provoking and emotionally charged cinematic experience. With its exceptional performances, especially from Cillian Murphy and Robert DJ, the film delves deep into the moral dilemmas of scientific progress and the burden of responsibility. Nolan's directorial prowess and storytelling mastery shine once again, making Oppenheimer a powerful and unforgettable cinematic experience.Movies like Oppenheimer challenge us to grapple with the complexities of history, science, and the human condition. They remind us of the power and responsibility we hold as individuals and as a society to use our knowledge and capabilities for the greater good.On my way home after watching the film, I found myself experiencing a mix of emotions - sadness, admiration, and perhaps even a sense of existential contemplation."
"Probably the most thought-provoking big-budget studio film in the last 20 years. While this was a fine film, the acting was utterly tremendous. Cillian Murphy, Robert Downy Junior, and Emily Blunt put on a true masterclass in acting, dwarfed only by the magnitude of Oppenheimer's life's work: the atomic bomb. Magnificent performances, and as far as big-budget studio films go, Oppenheimer may be second to none. The film had so many layers, and was truly one of the finest examples of the magnitude of life's everlasting consequences. It's silly to say a commercially successful movie will clean up at awards season, but it would be a travesty if the Cillian, RDJ, and Emily Blunt didn't all get a statue, as well as the sound team, and cinematography."
"This has had to be one of the most anticipated movies of the year and I got to say Nolan did not miss on this one. Throughout the entire 3 hours long the movie played for I did not feel bored once at all. There was always something big about to happen that you were just waiting to see, nothing in the film was not needed and everything in it made the movie even better. The cinematography in this movie is absolutely outstanding. The Atomic Bomb scene is one of the best scenes from a movie I've ever seen. When watching the scene for the first time there was about 2 minutes from when the button was pressed to the sound of the explosion, the 2 minutes felt like 20 seconds. During the 2 minutes my heart was beating to an extreme pace and when the sound came the whole theater vibrated feeling like the bomb hit you. But the ending is what makes this movie a true 10/10. Einstein tells Oppenheimer that his whole life he will have to deal with the consequences and regret of his creation. The casting in this movie is amazing as a think Cillian murphy does a great job playing Oppenheimer, and who doesn't love Robert Downey Jr."
"Oppenheimer is a difficult, thought provoking watch and does it's subject matter complete justice.Cillian Murphy is incredible in the lead role and deserves an Oscar nomination, the support cast are as equally up to the job.Nolan has created another masterpiece, this is a cinematic treat and every second of it's runtime is a pleasure to behold.The soundtrack is stunning and the cinematography is superb. This is truly a Nolan film and there can be no bigger credit than that!.The only observation i would make about the film is the last 45 minutes to an hour are very packed with political drama. I was very engaged in this but if you are expecting it to end with the bomb you might be disappointed.This is a film you need to watch in IMAX to be best appreciated, you won't be disappointed."
"Unbelievable performances from Murphy and Downey Jr in a film so rich in it's tapestry. It explores the morals, politics and human endeavour of the Manhattan project so well. The cinematography is outstanding as you expect from Nolan. A beautiful and unique soundtrack backdrops the mania of taking on a task of such magnitude - You can almost physically feel the weight of it as the moment comes to test the bomb.Nolan uses sound to such great effect here, with a scene shortly after the bomb test seeming louder and more intense than the test itself highlighting the ripple effects on Oppenheimer of this incredible but world changing breakthrough.The last hour was utterly superb drama for me, though for some it will feel like a drag. The time skewing seems overly complex but overall I really loved this with so many of the star studded performances being the best I've seen from some of these actors."
"This movie is really good. From its writing, its direction, it casting. I really loved it. I liked that the movie doesn't talk entirely about the bomb but talks about its creator oppenheimer in a story that makes you think how it must have felt to be aboard that manhatten project. Visually the movie is stunning. The sound effects and the music composed by ludwig is fantastic. You can actually feel the power of the nuke like you're there on the test site. Cillian Murphy was absolutely incredible, the other actors like matt damon, Robert downy and Emily blunt etc were really great too. I give it 10/10."
"Yes I'm giving this a 7 for its achievements with the whole production, acting, cinematography, score and above all the difficult biopic choice. It is an interesting story and I am a huge history fan. Which helped a lot with heaps of the other side characters.The run-time was not an issue for me .I will however say I want more vintage Nolan next. He's tried two movies in this historical genre Dunkirk which I don't rate at all and now Oppenheimer which I feel is a huge redemption.Tenet was far too confusing and average compared to other Nolan epics. You've done well Nolan I salute you, it's time to go back to what you do best."
"To be fair I already watched the excellent synopsis from Veritasium and others on youtube. If it were the 2000's and youtube wouldn't exist I would give this one an 8/10.But this is a movie that didn't use ANY CGI at all. Literally. None. The whole atomic bomb explosion was grotesque to watch, given my background in nuclear physics.Even when they showed how Oppenheimer learned about the Hiroshima the director chose to not show any pictures of it.It's a bizzare account of history, with a few shortcuts to not stretch it out even further. It's bizzarre because it shows nothing about the war or world or state of the world but just bits and pieces scrambled together from files in the archives of the USA.So incredibly boring and incredibly bad to be fair. But Nolan wouldn't have gotten the funding for the movie if investors couldn't be sure there are enough followers and Boomers who cherish stuff like ""100% NO CGI"".Lastly there is no coherent story. It's chronologically coherent as you would expect from history. In the end, the big channels on Youtube (>5 Million subs) have covered Oppenheimer the person one much better and with higher accuracy. Of course they would have never covered this without the hypewagon created by the Oppenheimer marketing department. It's a catch21."
"I would say it's about 8.5 of 10 - but generally not possible to make movie of such specific topic with score 10. Too complex. I think Nolan received about 97% of maximum possible result. But at least half of this score - is a work of his fantastic Dream Team.It will not be a bestseller where people are shocked during months after watching, but this is a nice movie which answers a complex question WHY DID PEOPLE CREATE IT?I would recommend to briefly read about history of the Bomb and Oppenheimer's bio BEFORE watching.It's not a movie about Manhattan Project and a Bomb (that's why - the Trinity explosion - is really crap). Surprise - it's about the Scientist, it's about complex moral questions. It's about an Achievement, which doesn't have analogues in the World History.My personal shock. Damon - Groves, Hartnett - Lawrence? Oh, I'm really old... Come on, I saw Pearl Harbour just yesterday..."
"Not Gonna Lie I was not expecting Exteremly Good Film but I am exteremly suprised If I split the film In 3 Pieces (every Piece 1 hour)
First Piece Is Really Confusing Part Because Film Does Not Go On a Straight Line I Sometimes Shows Future / past Continously New Characters are entering movie
Second Piece And The Beggining Of The Third Piece Is My Favourite part
Oppenheimer has a relationship with an communist . While Developing Nuclear Weapon He Needs To Get security approval
But Due The Relationship With An Communist He Struggles To get security approval he has to leave His Communist Partner To get security approval But This Woman Couldnt handle it and ends her life.Oppenheimer attract remorse because of thisBut In The End He Gets His Security approval and builds a nuclear development base named los almos to work contionuslyAfter Creating Nuclear Weapon US goverment throw 2 bombs Against Japanese EmpireFirst Bomb's target was telling japan to We Are Superior Now SurrenderSecond Bomb's Target Was If You Dont Surrender We Will Keep Doing itIn The End New President truman pushes oppenheimer to develop hydrogen bomb but oppenheimer refuses because he already caused Tons Of Death And He Doesnt Want To Keep Doing ThisIn The End Oppenheimer was going to get judge against relations with communist party. This Is An Unfair Judgement after this Kind Of Events Oppenheimer Loses His Security Approval But They Decided Oppenheimer was Loyal American citizenIt Containst Much More Events In The End But I Recommend To Watch Film To understand Better."
"Before Oppenheimer my favourite used to be Alan Turing's Biopic 'The Imitation Game'. Now I consider Oppenheimer is the film of this century with great story telling combining Science and politics. Every detail in this film is like a stellar experience to watch. Christopher Nolan did a brilliant work in showcasing every aspect of Dr. Oppenheimer's life. Chevalier Incident, Edward Teller(Father of Hydrogen Bomb), Karl Fuchs, Ernico Fermi, 1954 Security Hearing etc, all you need to know about before going to Theatres. I assume Nolan have shown the development of ""Fatman"" which was dropped on Nagasaki that was filled by plutonium in this film."
"This movie has some of the BEST cinematography and acting I've ever seen. Everything seems to be very accurate to history (wardrobe, sets, etc). Cillian Murphy is the perfect casting choice for Oppenheimer and he killed it. I do somewhat feel that certain characters should have been given more screen time but the film is already 3+ hours. I also felt the pacing was a little random. This will not be an easy watch, especially for younger audiences. The ending has to be one of the best I have ever seen. No matter how many times I rewatch, I always get chills. Contrary to what others have said, the trinity test scene is absolutely PERFECT and manages to feel different from all other movie explosions. This is definitely one you don't want to miss on the big screen. 70mm if possible!!!"
"Vada Pav: The Iconic Mumbai Street FoodVada Pav, a beloved street food originating from the bustling streets of Mumbai, is a mouthwatering combination of flavors and textures that has captured the hearts of millions. Comprising of a spicy potato fritter (vada) encased in a soft bun (pav), this delectable snack is a testament to the fusion of Indian and Portuguese culinary influences.The vada pav recipe begins with the preparation of the vada mixture. Boiled and mashed potatoes are seasoned with an array of spices including mustard seeds, cumin seeds, turmeric, and chopped green chilies. This mixture is then sautéed with finely chopped onions and ginger-garlic paste, infusing it with layers of savory flavors.For the batter that coats the potato mixture, besan (gram flour) is mixed with water, creating a smooth consistency. A pinch of turmeric and red chili powder adds both color and a hint of heat to the batter. The potato mixture is carefully encased in this batter and then deep-fried to golden perfection. The resulting vadas are crisp on the outside, with a warm, spicy potato filling on the inside.The pav, or the bun, is another essential component of vada pav. These soft, slightly sweet buns are sliced horizontally and lightly toasted on a griddle with a touch of butter. This toasting imparts a delightful crunch to the exterior while keeping the interior soft and pillowy.To assemble the vada pav, a green chutney and a garlic chutney are spread generously on the inside of the pav. The green chutney, made from cilantro, mint, green chilies, and lemon juice, adds a refreshing and tangy kick. The garlic chutney, with its pungent and spicy notes, provides a contrasting depth of flavor.The fried vada is carefully placed between the chutney-slathered pav halves, creating a tantalizing blend of textures and tastes. The crispy vada complements the softness of the pav, while the chutneys add layers of zesty and aromatic dimensions.Vada pav is often served with a side of fried green chilies or mirchi, adding an extra level of spiciness for those who dare. Some variations of vada pav also include cheese, creating a fusion of Indian and Western flavors that has gained popularity in recent years.This beloved street food embodies the spirit of Mumbai: fast-paced, flavorful, and diverse. It has become a cultural icon, transcending boundaries and appealing to taste buds worldwide. Vada pav vendors can be found on almost every street corner in Mumbai, serving this satisfying snack to locals and tourists alike.In conclusion, the vada pav recipe is a harmonious blend of ingredients and techniques that results in a tantalizing street food experience. From the aromatic potato mixture to the tangy chutneys, and the soft pav to the crispy vada, every element plays a crucial role in creating this culinary masterpiece. Enjoyed by people of all ages, vada pav continues to be an emblem of Mumbai's vibrant food culture."
"Oppenheimer is brilliant. The movie is so intense- 3 hours passed by for me (twice) without blinking an eye. The effect the movie has on its audience is profound. Sound track did complete justice. Seamless intertwining of two parallel storylines. Acting is just brilliant- Cillian Murphy shines like none. So do Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr and Emily Blunt. The movie explores the political theatre of World War II and the following Cold War with such nuance. The final twist is superb. Christopher Nolan's movies are a gift to mankind. Oppenheimer has officially qualified to be my favourite movie of all times (until Nolan makes a better one..;))"
"""Oppenheimer"" is a mesmerizing cinematic masterpiece that delves into the riveting life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant scientist behind the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. Directed by the visionary filmmaker, this biographical drama transcends the boundaries of a typical historical documentary, offering an intimate and thought-provoking exploration of Oppenheimer's complex character and his moral dilemmas.The film's cinematography is breathtaking, capturing both the haunting beauty of the nuclear tests and the somber depths of Oppenheimer's conscience. The narrative brilliantly weaves through his personal struggles, intellectual brilliance, and the grim reality of unleashing the ultimate weapon of destruction. The audience is transported into the era, immersing them in the atmosphere of tension and uncertainty.What sets ""Oppenheimer"" apart is the raw and authentic portrayal of its characters. The lead performance is a tour de force, as the actor masterfully conveys Oppenheimer's inner turmoil and the burden of his choices. The supporting cast, including fellow scientists and military personnel, add depth and authenticity to the narrative, breathing life into history.The film isn't merely a historical account; it raises profound ethical questions about the consequences of scientific discoveries and the responsibility of the scientists behind them. It prompts viewers to ponder the implications of progress and the human cost of such groundbreaking achievements.While the runtime may feel long for some, every moment is justified as it allows the audience to fully grasp the emotional journey of Oppenheimer. The dialogues are insightful and profound, adding layers of depth to the character dynamics.In summary, ""Oppenheimer"" is a captivating film that not only honors the legacy of one of history's most enigmatic figures but also challenges viewers to contemplate the weight of their own decisions. A cinematic triumph that deserves accolades for its storytelling, performances, and thought-provoking themes. This is a must-watch for both history enthusiasts and those who seek cinematic brilliance with substance."
"Beyond mediocre... I would have give it a 2* or 1, but I stopped at 4, for the history that it recreated, which was interesting to watch. Otherwise, as Shakespeare said: too much.... Some visual ""effects"" - I had a feeling that I watch Winamp or Windows Music creating random form, the music was many times so parallel with the film, going on its own track - I had a feeling that the composer watch only one or two sequences and then exaggerated... I bet it's hard to try to grow in Zimmer's shadows...
Too boring - the movie was too boring. It tried to excuse Oppenheimer of his contribution for eternity at destroying lives, but pointing that it's the politician who is the real killer... I left with the feeling if Barbie wasn't a better choice. I like Nolan's movies - I watched them all, some a few times. I don't believe this is the movie of the year!"
"This movie is such a departure from a standard Nolan film in that it is a true story. It is a story about how a group of people got together to change the world through science and maybe not for the better. The story that is told is very clear, there is a pre-Nuclear war world and a post-Nuclear war world. The US spent almost 3 billion in 1945 money on a single project that would shape the nature of warfare and it was done by some pretty awful people, most of all J Robert Oppenheimer.The movie itself is almost perfect. Incredible pacing and storytelling. Incredible acting from everyone. There are so many ""Oh that's so and so"" moments throughout the movie and it felt like every single performance was genuine. From the first frame, the visuals and the score really drive home this sense of impending doom and anxiety. That pace never lets up and by the time you hit the final act it doesn't at all feel like it's been 3 hours. Visually I just can't say enough about this movie. Hoyte Van Hoytema is going to walk away with his first Academy Award and if he doesn't it will be straight up robbery. After saying all of this I'm not sure this is a film that you are meant to enjoy. It's really heavy in subject matter and it's implications. I left the theater feeling like I had been through something. Great overall experience."
"After 2 and a half hours, you realize that it all revolves around the conflict between Oppenheimer and Strauss, who originally hired him to create the Atom Bomb. Strauss later tried to undermine him simply because he didn't want to give Oppenheimer so much credit. Other topics such as competition with the Nazis, how the bomb was made, Oppenheimer's relationship with Eisenstein, and his love life are only briefly touched upon. There is a continuous musical score accompanied by overwhelming sound effects to alleviate the boredom. You are relieved when things become slightly clearer at the end what is the focus of the movie and especially that the film is finely over."
"Christopher Nolan's latest directorial effort left me with mixed feelings. The screenplay and scriptwriters fell short, resulting in a convoluted and confusing narrative. Despite Nolan's attempts to overdo things, the weak foundation couldn't support the complexity. The music lacked a thematic connection to the storyline, leaving the overall experience underwhelming. While the film showcased impressive visuals and cinematography, it couldn't compensate for its flaws. A five-star rating for technical prowess, but the execution fell flat, leaving me wanting more from this talented director. Hoping for a better show next time around."
"It was a gorgeous looking thing and some terrific work by Robert Downey Jr and a whole host of other folks. Watching a 70 mm print made a big difference but it would sure be nice if people was bad hearing like me could actually get all of the dialogue.It's the end of the world as we know it, at least according to the Einstein character in the movie. Luckily the atmosphere did not ignite and envelop the entire planet.I'd have a whole lot more to say about this movie I really cared to share it but honestly I'm just babbling on at this point so that I can get over the hump of having sufficient number of characters to finish this thing. Enjoy the movie."
"The best cinematic experience of recent memory for me. I am feeling very sorry for those who didn't like it that much, they probably couldn't feel what I felt when it's ended.A lot of us already wrote long reviews that praise directing, editing, screenplay, Murphy, Downey, Blunt, score, sound editing etc; probably it's not necessary to submit another one like this.To realize the world you are living in right now, please try to watch carefully until the ending. Yes, it will be overwhelming to listen to things that you might never understand but trust me, it will worth it. Just keep it up until the last scene and you will know the world you are living in.I needed like 10 minutes to at least stand up from my chair but still feeling devastated since then. I honestly can't believe a movie can do such damage in such a beautiful way to a human being. Thank you for everyone behind this experience."
"This movie may be 180+ mins, this movie may be of full on drama, this movie may have multiple time lines running parallely, this movie may not have a single VFX shot.But all that does not matter, this is just an biography of Physicist 'J. Robert Oppenheimer' - his Triumph and demise(hauntings)Enjoy it while you can. Anybody can critisize a movie
(even one who does not understand the greatness and beauty of it). But this is a special one.The sheer technical aspects of the movie blow my mind! The basic principles of physics to the quantum level are met at a certain pointA True Masterpiece by Chris Nolan!!! Hats off for pulling this off!The Trinity test is a banger for all those who have a basic understanding of physics (which is light travels faster than sound)"
"Honestly one of the best movies Ive seen in a while. While this movie is 3 hours it completely kept my attention throughout. The actors portrayals were also fantastic. Particularly cillian murphy's, RDJrs and Emily blunt's.A few things to mention if you are going to watch it in IMAX theaters. I do recommend, however it is extremely loud right up to the point where if it was any louder I would've left. Also the dialogue was also sometimes hard to hear. So you'll have to weigh the pros and cons whether you want to see it in theaters. I would say the pros out way the cons tho.Overall I highly recommend. 9/10. Amazing. Can't give a 10 cause it's not perfect but almost."
"I admire Christopher Nolan's audacious decision to place the bomb test in the middle of the film instead of concluding with a grand finale. By eschewing the typical 'big bang' approach, Nolan artfully unveils the subtle yet crucial nuances of Oppenheimer's eventual downfall from grace. This unconventional narrative structure allows us to delve deeply into the complex issues that Oppenheimer encountered during the later phases of his illustrious career.As the story unfolds, a profound appreciation dawns upon the viewer, showcasing the challenges Oppenheimer faced and the moral dilemmas he wrestled with. Nolan's deliberate choice not to culminate with the Trinity test serves a purpose beyond cinematic bravado. Instead, it crafts a deeper understanding of Oppenheimer's significance-a poignant reflection of the consequences that arise from refusing to resort to violence against our adversaries, as it blurs the lines between 'us' and 'them.'Had Nolan opted for a more predictable conclusion, the film's powerful message might have been lost. However, by threading Oppenheimer's narrative with finesse and offering an unorthodox perspective, he ensures that audiences are left with an indelible impression of historical significance and the enduring lessons to be learned from this remarkable chapter in human history."
"Knowing Robert Oppenheimer and the Manhattan project background this movie was absolutely fantastic to me and exceeded my expectations! However, people who do not have an insight other than the scientist who made the atomic bomb this movie can be complex and hard to follow. Especially if you think it's going to be all explosions and madness. No it's about Oppenheimers accomplishment, challenges and complex life. It's a must watch just read a little on his background first to follow and enjoy better! The cinematography, the sound, acting, quality, and soundtrack were all excellent and a must see in RPX or IMAX. (I swear the room was shaking you can feel the explosions)"
"What Christopher Nolan achieves with this film is monumental to his catalouge. He proves that he can do more than an insanely complicated plot where you dont know whats left and what right. This film relies on well written dialogue and a dominating performance by Cillian Murphy. Accompanying that is a great display by Robert Downey jr who portrays Lewis Strauss, Downey Jr, shows what he is capable of in Oppenheimer, where Tony Stark is far away.The sound in this film was for me the MVP, my seat buzzed and I got completely engulfed in the film. Without cgi this movie is more beautiful than most we see these days and the feeling afterwards is I need to see it again!I believe this film will be a dominating player at the next Academy Awards and where Nolan might finally be rewarded for his outstanding work."
"This is really overrated movie compared to nolan's other films. I did not understand the nudity even two times. The scenes are also not necessary and not important for the movie. So it feels me like someone told nolan to make a movie about the atomb bomb and he did it like that by highlight how america is great and all the others should be scared from them.However, it is good to see how americans react to successful atomb bomb by smiling, celebrating, being honored and pride. They even do not care how much people died.Cillian murph is acting great and i really like the ending but anyways everytime i said that i should watch it again in the cinema but i did not say these words after this oppenheimer."
"Tbh., this has to win every Oscar there is... Cillian Murphy is a genius actor and one of our generation's finest. The cinematography, the plot, the acting, the historic accuracy: just everything is perfect.I've seen quite a lot of bad reviews for this movie, since it doesn't contain action scenes or anything close. At the same time, people are angry because the anticipated nuclear explosion-scene isn't what some hoped for. This movie is about OPPENHEIMER before, during and after the Manhattan Project. It's not about the nuke per se. It is dialogue-heavy and you probably should have some historic context/background for this movie, before you watch it.All in all: MASTERPIECE!"
"Pretty long film no doubt, But I had expectations because we were told by the cast and the director Christopher Nolan during the interviews, that the audience would be able to experience what destructive power an atomic bomb has just like what we can see for an explosion in Nuclear reactor visually in the show by HBO, Chernobyl.Disappointed, that nothing was shown visually, I couldn't connect with the guilt Oppenheimer had when he said, ""he feels blood on his hand"". Nevertheless, it is just a fulfilling documentary about J. Robert Oppenheimer depicted in the film, don't expect anything more."
"I've had more fun having my teeth surgically removed and sucking on a lime straight after.This movie was so unbelievably dull, yes the the actors did a good job but the story was so stretched out it could have been compacted into a 30mins documentary.Don't get me wrong I will watch this again when its on the streaming sites as a means to be sent asleep.Not sure how it's rated so high.It was a flip of the coin to see this or Barbie and believe me that coin is no longer with us, at least Barbie would have maintained our attention to the big screen.I think the names of the people involved are what draws people to see this but they are not enough to save it."
"Soo the movie was't bad. It's certainly a great movie to watch due to its great cinematography and actors such Murphy and Downey.But considering the hype, I was expecting more. It's been long since a good movie has been made and I get the hype about it but such a significant event in the history of humanity could've been delivered better.There is little about the physics, Oppenheimer only gets to mention fission and fusion with no further deep explanation or metaphors about the theories. Not to mention that the movie shows little about the actual building of the atomic bomb and more about the political drama.Some scenes and characters felt even unnecessary or irrelevant to the plot. Certainly the sex scene that was just there for no particular reason? I mean 3 unnecessary long hours could be cut at-least 30 mins.For all the hype, it was a bit disappointing. But, I can't deny that it was still a really good movie. A real story of such significance can't go wrong after all.A hard 8/10 from me :)"
"Really well shot, written and directed. Great acting from ALL cast. Excellent sense of suspense which ultimately leads to a fantastic movie that will be one to watch for years to come. I thought i would get bored as it was very long, i certainly did not. I didnt even look at my watch once which is incredible for me. Cilian Murphy plays an epic role and he captivates his viewers. Robert Downy Jr is on point as usual.From the very first scene of this movie i was so involved and immersed in the plot that it was hard to look away.I would not hesitate to watch this film again very soon if i have the chance."
The movie is a 3hour long Wikipedia audio book of Oppenheimer life story. The book that this movie is based on is a great work of literature which even won the Pulitzer Prize in the biography category.Overall the movie is very factually correct and captures the main events in the life of Oppenheimer and the major events of world war 2.It also contains dozens of notable scientists of whom many are Nobel laureates.The main con of the movie is like how the neutrons bombard the atoms in a chain reaction Nolan choses to bombard us with too much information as part of the Q clearance trial. If your native language is not English even with subtitles you are going to have a major inconvenience following the plot.So overall narrative is not gripping and some trivial events have been given so much of importance which kinda makes the plot a bit silly and the rivalry very petty.
"There's not a single moment without background score, except for the bomb explosion. It always bothers me when a film requires background music for everything, even quiet conversations, that nothing is good enough to survive without musical support. Also bleach bypassing IMAX seems a real waste - why use a lab process that increases grain and reduces contract ratio on the highest resolution film medium available? It all feels pretty one note, style over substance. Dry. Given Nolan's limitless resources it should be much more rounded. I didn't care about anyone, or even really get to know anyone, including Oppenheimer. Overall really disappointing and all the glowing reviews to me feel like everyone has drunk the Kool Aid. The emperor has no clothes. Not sure how much I'm influenced by having read the biography it's based on. Dr George Miller used to say that a film should feel like a great piece of music with highs, lows, quiet, crescendos, pacing. This feels like one very long chorus, and not a great one at that."
"Oppenheimer is very much a beautifully shot, edited and scored achievement in filmmaking. However, this movie, either by design or unintentionally is not as gripping or thrilling as other Nolan movies. Perhaps, the audience should have expected this given that it was marketed as a biopic. But, still, with Nolan at the helm, I expected more suspense. The stakes of the Manhattan project were existential, yet that feeling of existentialism was lacking throughout the film. Cillian Murphy's performance was masterful, but I don't feel that I learned anything of substance about the subject he was portraying."
"Why did it feel like a huge tv series recap of thrown together highlights to give you the back story of the next season lol! Felt like a super long trailer! After 20 mins I was thinking hope it's starts soon, after 1 hour ""when is this film going to start?"" After a few hours in I was bored and looking at the time.I love Christopher Nolan. Love! And have from the beginning, memento to inception, the Batman's to interstellar. The guy is a genius. And has blown the world away.But...Look let's all just be super realistic right now and honest with ourselves. This film was not it! Okay if you truly loved it and it was the movie you needed in your life and it satisfied all your expectations and gave you hope in cinema again, I'm super happy for you and glad you enjoyed it. But you have got to be in the minority of people, because I think people will just say it's awesome out of respect to the big names. It was just so messy and was trying to hard. Just give us the story! Build your characters! And let the actors act! Let us actually feel something! If you want to do it artsy then give us a 'there will be blood' vibe! I personally would like to know the history and the people of what happened and to actually feel something about this crazy time of the world but it was done in such I just didn't feel much.And it was in fact ...Boring.Okay I'm not movie expert but I love cinema, im actually a video editor so it's a huge part of my life, I'm not an immature film lover who needs all the super fake unrealistic garbage that gets thrown out these days. So I was super hyped for this one. But this film was boring! Interesting at times and a few things I liked. But if we are doing a film about nuclear bombs let us be full of fear like they must have been, give us the true horrific truth about setting off a nuclear bomb.Anyway
Glad people enjoyed it. Hope CN brings more films out soon. I just hope someone comes and saves movies and we walk into a time of unbelievable films. Because I'm just tired and actually want to be entertained."
"Disclaimer: To non-Dutch speaking audiences this may seem fussy or overly critical. But imagine there was a British-made docudrama on the life of John F. Kennedy, and the actor portraying Kennedy spoke with a strong British accent, would you be upset? And that's only an accent...Nolan got an entire language wrong, and all he had to do was check Once. I understand this isn't a documentary, but this was Quite the interruption from the movie; for the entire audience. I watched Oppenheimer in the Netherlands, so to the audience it was blatantly obvious that Oppenheimer wasn't speaking Dutch, instead he spoke German in the scene in Leiden. Mixing the 2 is no small mistake here, I don't need to explain why.During the movie and shortly thereafter I thought of this mistake as rather small yet quite annoying to those who noticed. However, after I took one look at what Wikipedia had to say about Oppenheimer I think Nolan made quite a big error.Oppenheimer was praised for giving lectures in Dutch while in Leiden. I think that's quite remarkable, and so did others. He was given the nickname ""Opje"" which later became ""Oppie"". This whole thing is one of the many pillars of Oppenheimer's character. And Nolan missed it, devaluing the work of Everyone involved.So, first I was annoyed with Nolan, now I think he should stick to fiction. The movie is worth a 6, it was nice, that's it."
There's no sugar coating or talking about a different narrative here. We all know what really happened and this movie tries to glorify and make a message out of something that is a disgrace to humanity. I went in and really wanted to give it a fair go but the whole idea of the movie is ridiculous and I just couldn't get past it. Millions of people died for no reason despite surrending. There is no sugar coating it. The cast did a good job. Story was well paced. Directing was well done as expected. You have to focus and pay attention to really get lost in the movie and while it does those things moderately well.. but I still found this movie just a totally disrespectful for the human experience.
"*Context:*
""Oppenheimer,"" directed by Christopher Nolan, promised a riveting biography of Robert Oppenheimer and the creation of the atomic bomb, but unfortunately, it veered off course and left viewers wanting more. The film focused primarily on discussions surrounding Oppenheimer's security clearance and Strauss' confirmation hearing, failing to deliver on its marketed premise.*Negative aspects:*
The negative aspects of ""Oppenheimer"" are quite pronounced. Running for nearly three hours, the film was heavily laden with discussions, ego clashes, and court room drama, rather than exploring the intriguing world of atomic bomb creation and the scientific brilliance that shaped history. Although the discussions and courtroom drama were needed but at the cost of A-bomb development process, was something not anticipated at all. The Trinity test bomb scene, while boasting great sound design, suffered from inefficient visuals that did not live up to expectations (as promised before release).Complexities & non linear narrative again:
Adding to the film's complexity, a non-linear storytelling approach left many viewers perplexed and struggling to grasp the sequence of events and the significance of certain conversations. The omission of pivotal moments, such as Oppenheimer's childhood years and the aftermath of World War II, hindered the film's ability to provide a holistic portrait of the brilliant scientist and visionary.*Few positive aspects:*
On a positive note, the film's sound design and soundtrack deserve acclaim for its flawless execution. Additionally, the performances of the cast were commendable, with RDJ delivering a noteworthy portrayal.*Conclusion:*
In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" embarked on a bold journey to depict one of the most significant periods in history, yet it ultimately fell short of achieving its full potential. The film's preoccupation with discussions and courtroom drama overshadowed the opportunity to delve deeper into the fascinating world of atomic science.*Final words:*
""Oppenheimer"" falls short as a biopic, failing to showcase the crucial A-bomb development process and attacks. While the sound design is impressive, the film left me unsatisfied, yearning for a deeper exploration of historical events. A missed opportunity to deliver a compelling narrative on a pivotal figure in history. It was marketed a ""biopic thriller"" but ended up being ""biopic courtroom drama thriller""."
"This biography of J Robert Oppenheimer can be told in 1 hr 30 min max. It has been stretched for 3 hrs don't know why which has made this film very boring. Didn't expect this from Nolan. Instead of showing only dialogues in the entire film for 3hrs straight he should have added atleast some action sequence..
I thought that after the interval maybe this movie will pick up some speed but no it was only dialogues the entire time...dont know why people are liking this trash film. I was expecting something like interstellar or atleast some action sequence. Apart from all this boring stuff the cinematography was good as it was shot on IMAX and cgi wasn't used so if that is a good reason for you to watch this film you can go ahead but I wont recommend this movie to watch in the movie theatre, wait for it to come in the OTT."
"Make no mistake, Christopher Nolan is a brilliant filmmaker. While reading the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin, I felt that the narrative bogged down a bit in the forensic historiography of Oppenheimer's unfortunate excursions into left wing political politics during WW2 and the resultant McCarthyesque fallout after the dropping of the bomb. I feel that Mr. Nolan got caught in that same bog, and the film suffers a bit as a result. The rest of the film is brilliant, and might have come in better at the 160 minute mark. The dialogue in the first half was also unfortunately blared out by the soundtrack. I saw it in XD. A good watch for history buffs interested in the beginnings of the Cold War."
"I walk out on very few movies and this was the third movie I have walked out on. I'm glad to hear I didn't miss much as the remaining 1.5 hours were the same. I kept asking myself when will the movie get good? This movie started reminding me about working with all the men in my field and how all of them want to be masters of the universe. There are no interesting characters. I would've enjoyed a movie about WW2 more. In fact, even Pearl Harbor was more enjoyable than this bore.Wasted talent and money about really nothing. Truly insignificant about a significant event in history. Wasted and disappointing. At least the marketing department worked."
"Good CGI on nuclear explosions. Jumps around rather than a linear presentation. It would be hard to sit through another look. Once and done. We saw it in IMAX which was nice. The Lewis Strauss portrayal reminds me of the current Democrat Party.The other part of the Strauss legacy is overwhelmed by his machinations against Oppenheim.Robert Downey Jr. Played the role so well one can only look down on any positive contributions Lewis Strauss did before or after what he did to Oppenheimer. I hope people take what he did to Oppenheimer as a warning on how the search for absolute power as Lord Acton the British historian coined "" Absolute Power Corrupts Absolutely""See the movie if evil political intrigue does not raise your blood pressure too high."
"Its a terribly long movie with a lot of noise, less of a storyline, far fetched from the truth and well its overhyped. Might even win an academy award but would never pay to watch it in theatres, might just watch it on Netflix if im too depressed. Have seen better CGI as well as documentaries on youtube videos. Expected a lot better from Nolan but maybe its the general public that hyped it up. All those people going to visit theatres to see this movie thinking of it as an exciting thrill or something, well you've got another thing coming since it sucks and so does Manyu claiming to be an exciting movie."
"So just came back from prague to see it in imax 70mm and got kind of mixed feelings. I it reminded me why i did not enjoy nolans movies in the past too much. He is a good director, because he choose the right actors, acting itself is great, everyone does a great job. Also locations and set design, the look, editing and cinematography are great. But in my opinion all of his recent films lack focus. He always tries to squeeze to much into the story and does not ""kill his darlings"". The writing is just not good, too much dry exposition. Often times charakters telling each other things they already know. Oppenheimer, even though he is in almost every scene, keeps a stranger to us. I could not disrcibe his character, since we only have external things happening to him. The exeption might be the hall scene, where the crowd cheers him after the bomb was used against japan. This was the best moment for me.Too much is touched just a little, but always too short to really feel for the charakter. The oppenheimer story isn´t so complex as it seems, but nolan just keeps adding more people and time jumps to give us the feeling that this is an gigantic epos. This would not be that bad, but the music is almost playing in every scene. Therefore every dialog, every person is somehow emphasized and after a while it just feels like a never anding trailer.My last point is imax. You do not need to see it in imax. I was curious technically, but it did not made much sense since this is 90% talking heads. I would make more sense for a movie with big landscapes or in space. I think 70mm is the way to go."
Completely zero entertainment. There is no story at all. People are flocking theatres with hype created and at the end there is no single person who seems to have enjoyed the film. Some people who tell they liked the film are bluffing acting like intellectuals with reality being they are dumb *ss. Do your self a favor and skip this crap. Watch Paramanu which is 100 times better movie. Watch Paramanu which is 100 times better movie. Watch Paramanu which is 100 times better movie. Watch Paramanu which is 100 times better movie. Watch Paramanu which is 100 times better movie. Watch Paramanu which is 100 times better movie.
"OK, full disclosure, I really feel I shoukd be rating this higher that a 7 on the back of other people's reviews, but that's all I feel I can do for now. I might actually re watch soon. Extemely important film, and very good acting all round, I was just looking for something more I think. I beleive the sheer enormity of the subject matter in hand deserved a more dramatic punch for the viewer. I really wanted to leave feeling utterly shocked and conflicted by the film. Maybe it's subtlety is what makes it so good? Just not convinced at the moment. Very much leaning towards an early second viewing."
"I think this is a massively overhyped, seriously underwhelming film which I am afraid I gave up on halfway through! Watching it was such a slog, I struggled to stay awake - and that doesn't happen to me!It's unrelenting documentary style is not easy to engage with and there are very few lighter moments to entice the viewer to keep watching or to become emotionally involved.The story jumps from one era to another, dialogue is so heavy and the whole film just drags incessantly on and on like a tedious school history lesson, where you can't help checking your watch again and again!Avoid at all costs is my advice!"
"Great cinematography, exceptional acting, terrific storytelling!It's not a very entertaining popcorn flick! And one that won't probably have repeat viewing when it becomes available. The length of 3 hours helps a movie that dwells so much into introspective details and storytelling, and isn't really felt when you are in it.. but one that hurts it as a prospective movie to watch on theaters when making the choice. And due to its contents, I would not suggest watching it on IMAX, as a normal theater would work fine.. specially because of the terrible sound muffling the voices! Thank Buddha for subtitles.All in all, it's an easy recommendation for any film lovers, but maybe not for your below-average viewer. Personally, I wouldn't call it Nolan's best, but I can easily understand why....
Now! More than anything, it has been really interesting to see it being promoted as part of the whole ""Barbenheimer"" duo! A movement to celebrate movie going (even if it was forged by the people behind it) that people are taking part of and eating it up.With both movies being are advertised as something that feel like a ""sleight of hand"", depending on how you see it. From a movie that offers all the colors and fun from a known franchise, while seemingly ""hiding its agenda"" from its ad campaign (from what I've heard) or the fact that it isn't really a story for kids.. While Oppenheimer strongly advertised as a film from creative director Nolan (with his ""IMAX gimmick"") being an almost documental movie that focuses mostly on character development and objective and subjective content, and almost no action or ""money shots"". I wonder how many people were tricked by either, seeing how many of the viewers in the theater today left constantly throughout. Personally, can't wait for the second weekend box office numbers!!Is this the last big movie we'll ever get? Well, it was worth it."
"I fail to see how a three hour long movie can fail the bechdel test, your telling me in three hours there aren't two women that have a conversation about something other than a man. The lack of historical accuracy is shown by the lack of women that were important to the creation of the atom bomb that were not portrayed. This movie is romanticising someone that isn't even a good person that killed more than hundreds of people. It's incredibly boring.A boy film for boys about boys, building big boy bombs to hurt other boys. I don't even want to compare it to Barbie because there's more to say before that."
"When the Oscars come round I don't think it will be Cillian Murphy that gets his shoulder tapped I think it could be Emily Blunt and Robert Downie Jr who plays Oppenheimer's would be nemesis, Lewis Strauss. Don't get me wrong, Murphy is good, just not truly great.And that about sums up this overlong movie, good just not truly great.The plot wriggles and writhes through timelines in such a way as to satisfy Nolan's trademark need for complexity and I have to confess to being confused for much of its three hours.Also, if I was watching this as a Japanese viewer I'd be gritting my teeth at the overall celebration of the outcome of Oppenheimer's technical success. It treads a fine line between glorification and condemnation of the A Bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima killing over 200,000 Japanese civilians.And while Nolan coaxes a degree of remorse out of his central character I wasn't 100% convinced that he really did regret his actions. Sure he denounces them, to an extent, but he didn't go into this in wide eyed innocence, Oppenheimer absolutely knew his objective. The ethics are pretty muddled, like a lot of the plot in my view.Ach, it's a hard one to deconstruct. I'm a little surprised at the ratings this movie is attracting because it's a long hard slog with a LOT of dialogue and not a great deal of action.Perhaps the best scenes are the test sequences in the desert, the senatorial election drama at the end and the creepy but well handled rabble rousing reception Oppenheimer receives from his team on the news that Hiroshima has been obliterated. At least in this scene Nolan convinces us that it's not a celebration of the bombing, but an indictment.Oppenheimer's vilification as a possible Communist is a central theme of the movie and is key to Strauss's objections and the 1954 kangaroo court FBI security clearance meeting which anchors the plot. There seems little evidence that he was a Commie, but the McCarthy regime at that time seemed to put little store in hard evidence and he clearly fared badly in this terrible stitch up.Perhaps my favourite moment in the movie is the look of schadenfreude on the face of Strauss's advisor towards the end of the movie.It's a delicious moment in a banquet that sadly has more plain fare than delicacies."
"What a drag! Jesus. Three hours, really? I almost fell asleep two times during its span, my partner shook me up. Long, long, long, just boring. Goodness me, just how boring it is. If it was cut by half, it wouldn't be short enough even then. I understand the need of character development, but this? A horrible waste of time by moaning, whimpering and regret forever. Those feelings were there for sure, you just shouldn't watch them for three hours as an entertainment. The story is sublime of course, but the screenplay is bad and so is the execution. This movie, with all the hype around it, is a big let down. I am severely disappointed."
"The issue I have with Nolan films is I find them to be emotionally disengaging, I find Oppenheimer no different.There is no doubting the stunning cinematography, impressive sound design and strong performances, yet I find it difficult to connect to the characters and story, Nolan's clinical approach to storytelling leaves you feeling distant.The all too familiar non-linear narrative can at times leave the film feeling disjointed, I can't see a reason why in Biopic it is necessary, it adds little to the film in both narrative and artistically. Despite the 3-hour run it feels rushed towards the end, As the film moves its attention entirely to the post war setting, Nolan tries to cram as much as he can into the last half hour, leading to a feeling of information overload. The film tries to tell two stories. The story of the creation of the atom bomb reaches at satisfactory conclusion, however the post war maybe should've been a separate film in order to flesh the detail and give it some space to breath.Cillian Murphy is superb as always and the support cast was excellent, every scene there seemed to be recognisable face in minor role. I would have liked to have seen more of Emily Blunt, I felt she was underutilised and brought some much-needed emotional drive to the film.Overall, from a technical perspective It's a great film but it leaves me not feeling a whole lot of anything towards it, it certainly won't linger in my head and I doubt I'll be coming back for a second viewing.....7/10."
"The good parts? The acting, top notch. The story itself is also very important and interesting, but it was told in an awfully bad way and very slow progression of main storyline. It is NOT worth watching in the cinema, there is very poor usage of sound effects. It's just loud for no reason. Only the bomb effect was great, but rest is just very loud noise for no good reason and you just don't want to hear at it full blast when people are clapping or similar loud noises. It provides absolutely no effect other than you want to close your ears. Also bad cinematography, random use of white/black coloring for no good reason. It's not used as flashback there is no consistency of using white/black here and there it's just random and doesn't make the film anymore interesting, completely unnecessary. IMO the worst film Christopher Nolan has produced so far. If not for amazing acting, I would've left the cinema. 3 hours used to tell a story that could EASILY have been boiled down to 1,5 hours. 30-40% of the movie is about an interrogation that has real consequense or impact to the audience, it just seems like an awful long waste of time because. Some guy felt leftout so he decided to run a cross examination of Oppenheimer, which leads to nothing except he can't have his security clearance re-approved. Why would you Nolan spent 40% of the film on this utterly boring part? I honestly beats me how people can enjoy this movie. I would rather watch a black and white documentary on the manhatten project then my hearing would be intact and I would be more informed and less filled with nonsense."
"I love Christopher Nolan, one of my favourite directors. But he seems now to just be doing complicated difficult to follow films just for the sake of it, because he has to. People might say I'm stupid for not ""Getting it"" I did get it, he just took the long way round to explain it all. There was just no need for this. It should have been a 10/10 film. A man was snoring on the same row as me in the cinema, people talking getting agitated with it, because there was no need for this 3 hour slog of a film.Saying that what saved the film was brilliant acting. The story was brilliant but like I said just too drawn out and annoying to follow dialogue, especially in the last hour or so. There's some Oscar's in this film though for sure. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr excellent."
"BORING ... OVERHYPED ... WASTAGE OF TIME AND MONEY ....
I just watched the movie in the theater. I have never been so excited to watch a movie. I studied about Manhattan Project so much since my high school days. I am now 38 years old. But I have to say that I am really disappointed. This movie is OVER-HYPED. The three-hour-long movie is really dull. While the section on Manhattan Project is interesting, I find many scenes redundant and boring. The film could have been condensed into less duration removing unnecessary scenes. All actors did a great job in their respective roles. But Christopher Nolan has disappointed me with mixing various elements in a haphazard way. This movie is OK - But NOT GOOD and definitely NOT GREAT. I am really very disappointed."
"Do you know why Christopher Nolan has never won an Academy Award for Best Director, despite being nominated only once? It's because he is not a good director. His weird directing style leaves the characters and scenes underdeveloped and ambiguous. As a result, we cannot connect with the characters or the scenes. The many short scenes clearly depict the hurried and desperate direction. While Cillian Murphy's performance was great, all of the other actors were over-the-top smartasses, as we have seen in previous Nolan films.Additionally, Nolan's stubbornness in not using CGI for the Trinity test was a bad decision. His ""anti-CGI"" approach ruined the film for many. CGI is meant to be used when we cannot do something in reality."
"Tl;DR version
This film is a perfect example of how you can have all the best ingredients but if you put them together incorrectly you can end up with an unpalatable mess.We have a great story about an interesting character who played a pivotal part during one of the most decisive points in human history but sadly the real history is skimmed over in a confusing and boring fashion while the made-up history is lacklustre, obvious and stereotypical.We have some great actors who do some great acting but due to the lack of depth given to them the characters (even the main protagonists) are shallow and easily forgotten, even while still actually watching the film.We have a great musical score but the appalling sound mix exacerbates the poor story telling with the musical score overpowering and drowning out many of the character interactions. There are points of the film where the pointless noise (there was nothing going on that justified the sound being made and especially that loud) was so loud we put our fingers in our ears (note that we are used to loud noise going to rock and metal concerts) yet the one excuse the film had to overload your senses (the bomb test) was extremely underwhelming.Longer version;
As someone who has a grasp of the subject matter I found it painfully hard to follow, not because it was intelligently written or cleverly crafted to draw the viewer in but because the film is little more than a mixed up mess of anecdotes, infamous ""quotes"" and the most ""entertaining"" versions of revisionist history, many of which different versions were told at different points by Oppenheimer himself.It then tries to flesh out these events by adding in made up interactions which have no bearing in recorded history and doing so without even attempting to make them realistic, instead resorting to trope stereotyping. E.g. The completely made up interactions with Einstein and the films portrayal of communism. E.g. When Oppenheimer 'miss-quotes' Property is theft because he is really intelligent and ""read it in the original German"" and is then corrected...It is not even part of Marx's philosophy. Ironically as the film goes to great lengths to point out that Oppenheimer was not actually communist this would have been a great point to distance him from communism by instead of being corrected on his pronunciation he could have been corrected to point out it is a misappropriated quote perceived by people who have little knowledge of the subject.This wouldn't be so bad if this 'artistic impression' actually made a good film but the story is told in a horribly disjointed manor which seems to have no focus or know what story it is trying to tell, made worse by the fact the sound mixing is terrible which means (considering this is primarily a talking film) you have to strain to hear, never mind understand many of the conversations as the musical score is drowning it out. Even if you join the dots you are left wondering what the point of the film actually was.There is obviously a lot of discussion if the film should be 3 hours long...The film itself could have been about an hour long and been just as 'good' while ironically the film could have been much better if it was longer or made into a trilogy so that it could have actually spent some time with the vast depth of the subject matter but it instead feels more like you skim-read a book. As this is meant to be a biopic I felt like I knew nothing of Oppenheimer at the end of it and most of the other characters apart from Matt Damon's felt more like a bunch of extras and any time they re-occurred I had to try to remember who they were meant to be.In line with it being a trilogy we can break the film down into 3 parts. The first part of the film is essentially backstory although it just skims through everything, giving you no sense of timeline or timescale and basically just 'introduces you' to a bunch of bit part characters that keep popping back up later in the film. This could have been an interesting story in of itself, exploring the 'flawed genius' of Oppenheimer, how he came to be and the political uncertainty and general turmoil of the time period which lead many disaffected people to flirt with communism. Especially in this day and age the film could have explored the mental issues it appears he suffered with throughout his life and how that affected his decisions, including the scene with the apple but then there are no anecdotes about his depression so the writers had nothing to work with.The second part of the film is really the only reasonable part because it is such a well documented part of history it has a defined narrative and is the most historically accurate but again it only skims through the subject matter. Who were most of these people? What was it like having to live in an enforced closed community in the middle of nowhere? What did all the people who didn't actually know what was going on feel when they found out what they were doing and why they were living there?There were a number of female scientists and African-Americans working on the project yet we hear/see virtually nothing about them. One female scientist gets a bit part as there is an anecdotal quote recorded in history made by her and she had to be included as the script is essentially just one big anecdotal quote and the nearest thing we get to an African-American is (if you pay attention) a token audience member during the speech after the bomb is dropped, but he didn't get a speaking part as there are no anecdotal quotes in history for him to say.This part also includes the bomb itself. The defining point of Oppenheimer, without which he would have been at best a footnote in history and more likely no-one would have even heard of him. The film barely explores his thoughts on the whole concept apart from as an excuse to insert some fancy camera effects and barely even acknowledges the though process that went behind if, when, how and where the bomb(s) should be used, with us left with a made-up anecdote of ""Kyoto is excluded as I had my honeymoon there and it was lovely"" being the depth off the decision making behind one of the defining points in history.This part also includes the one legitimate time the film has to overpower your senses, the bomb test, yet it is little more than a damp squib.While the film did not try to tell the audience what to think it also provided the audience with no information about the subject to be able to make up their own minds so essentially we are just left with another bunch of scenes with bit part characters coming and going, revolving around a few anecdotes from history and a few made up ones filling the time quota.Part 3, the part of a film where it is meant to get really interesting, the part of the film where it all comes together, the plot twist happens and you find out the point of the story. Well it appears the film is about an arrogant, self-centred egotist who feels persecuted and the twist is...it is not about Oppenheimer but instead a character whom most people have no idea who they are (and the film doesn't bother to tell you) and there is actually only subjective conjecture as to his actual role/interactions in the Oppenheimer story.Rather than being a film about Oppenheimer it appears the main focus of the film is the senate hearings for the confirmation of Lewis Strauss and the McCarthy era witch hunts which Oppenheimer got caught up in and it is believed (by some) that Strauss sold Oppenheimer out to because he was apparently obsessed by Oppenheimer based on one incident which in the skimming nature of the film it barely even touches upon and instead leads the viewer to believe it all started when Oppenheimer turned Einstein against Strauss in a made up meeting that never actually happened...but it got Einstein into the film and got to reveal his infamous white hair in a dramatic fashion. We find out why all these bit part characters from the rest of the film are simply included because they are mentioned in the transcript of his hearing and part of the 'evidence' against Oppenheimer.Summary;
If you spend 5 minutes googling you will find out more about the history, story and characters involved than you will wasting 3 hours watching this film, even if can unpick the incoherent mess it is presented in."
"Maybe if you really love the style you will like it, but 3 hours is too much for this script, it is just too slow, like its intention is to be long. At times it is enjoyable, but if you are the kind who likes action movies (I am not, and still find it boring), you will most probably have problems enjoying this movie.Cillian Murphy is rather the same as in 'Peaky Blinders', I do not see him getting out of that role, the same facial expressions, tone...and smoking. I would have imagined Oppenheimer a bit different, not so 'british' as he is.It is not a bad movie, but rather a boring movie. It is also predictable, at least for me it was.Also, I am not a fan of black and white films, and I do not see the reason for doing it as such. Maybe if you are, you will understand it better. It all comes to personal taste in the end."
"Unpopular opinion here. I had to question if I was watching the same film everyone else was raving about as it was nowhere near a good as the hype. The 3hr film could have been 30 mins long and still conveyed the same information. Oppenheimer develops the atom bomb, tests it halfway through the film and the rest is set in a stuffy office room where a disgruntled colleague tries throwing him under the bus for being a communist. That's it. Throw in a lot of loud dramatic sound effects to attempt to make the visual aspect more interesting and there's your film. It was essentially 3 hours of blathering drivel and the first time I've considered leaving the cinema from boredom."
"Despite the anticipation surrounding Christopher Nolan's latest work, the film might not meet all expectations. The grandiosity of the movie, driven partly by Nolan's stellar reputation and the extensive marketing, creates a halo effect that might be misleading.The casting of Cillian Murphy in the lead role under Nolan's direction is a welcome decision, and his remarkable performance rightly takes center stage. However, the inclusion of over 21 celebrity cameos appears as an unneeded distraction, drawing attention away from the central narrative and undermining Murphy's role.Concerns also arise around the film's pacing. From the beginning, it plunges into a frantic tempo that continues relentlessly throughout. While this pace might be fitting for certain plot elements-such as racing against the Germans/Russians-the unyielding speed becomes disorienting. Quick scene cuts and often inaudible dialogue further contribute to the confusion.This incessant pace, though potentially intentional, restricts the artistry's room to breathe. The audience is left with little chance to immerse themselves and ""feel"" the film. With an expansive budget and a three-hour runtime, the rush to include substantial footage feels more like an attempt to justify the spending rather than letting the narrative unfold organically.Nevertheless, the movie's merits are undeniable. The visual splendor, combined with a beautiful musical score and Murphy's compelling performance, enriches the film's artistic value. Still, these qualities, as exceptional as they may be, do not suffice to label the work as a masterpiece.The conclusion to be drawn from Nolan's latest creation is that, while there is much to admire, certain choices undermine its overall impact. It might not connect with everyone, especially those seeking a more cohesive and immersive cinematic journey. The film shines in parts but may disappoint viewers expecting more than a Hollywood spectacle.Reflecting further, the true core of the story seems lost in the spectacle surrounding it. Nolan's name, the Hollywood cameos, the dominant score, and the grand IMAX visuals all contribute to the narrative receding into the background. The film's indulgence in cinematic glamour, though visually and auditorily thrilling, risks losing storytelling's essence. The intricate weave of characters, emotions, and themes gets overshadowed, tilting the balance towards appearance over depth. The result is a dazzling yet soul-unsatisfying movie that comes across more as a Hollywood extravaganza than a poignant human drama."
"No action, just talking heads and overly loud background music. Surprise surprise maybe a bomb goes off. Better of watching old videos about the MP on the Smithsonian website. Nakedness thrown in for no good purpose.Triumph of marketing. Why waste 3 hours on this when you could watch Babylon again where nakedness actually meaningful to the film.Weird graphics depicting quantum mechanics that adds nothing.Sequencing early, middle and late events -black and white -colour- back and forwards- totally doesn't add anything, except confusion.No sure its worth any nominations but I'm guessing it will get some sadly."
"I can review this movie from two perspective, 1. Story 2. Production.1. I did not know anything about him so it was all new facts to me. A very powerful story of a man driving a secret project towards discovering an atomic bomb. So the story and the storytelling was good, typical Nolan switching back and forward in time2. I expected more from Nolan! I expected more big landscape shots and more large scale action, the typical epic Nolan scenes, but there were very few, so that left us with almost 3 hours of dialogs, although with a good pace and nice edits with great sound effects, but just too much talking for a hollywood blockbuster. I liked the soundtrack, done by the Swedish composer Ludwig Göransson, but not oscar winning level.Favorite/fun parts were the scenes with Einstein, and the Truman scene, played by Gary Oldman 👌"
"This movie is really not worth your time. Poor story, great actors with nothing to do. Definitely one of the worst Christopher Nolan movies.It just does nothing. There is no suspense. There is no interesting politics. Basically no character development. Not even some suspense of the hard scientific problems solved, the hard moral and ethical dilemmas. Even the big finale is just the bomb test, not dropping them on Japan.The could have gone deeper into the science like with Interstellar. They could've have had the global geopolitics like with Ambassador. Really none of this is done. We don't even really learn about Openhimer as a person. His womanising is glossed over. The weekend it was released, the Barbie movie also came out. Wish we saw that instead...."
"Being a student of the history of nuclear weapons development, I was pleased that the film was surprisingly accurate in terms of Oppenheimer's role in the development of the atomic bomb. I was especially interested in the efforts made to destroy Oppenheimer's reputation after the war and applaud Robert Downey's Academy Award level performance. My reason for rating this film lower than I had hoped to rate it is the sound track. Three of us found it difficult to clearly hear the cast members because of either distortion in the recording or masking level ambient noise in the film. The use of ""airy"" voices that has become so prevalent in todays films is infuriating. It is as if the use of vocal cords in the uttering of speech is now forbidden. I kept wanting to shout out ""SPEAK UP"". SAY IT SO WE CAN HEAR YOU!"" Finally, the use of extreme noise levels in this film was far, far overdone. For an atomic bomb explosion? OK. But the use of room jarring, earth shaking low frequency sound levels over and over again was both gratuitous and ridiculous. I would be very careful in recommending this movies to my friends and relatives."
"Where do I even begin with this trainwreck of a movie? ""Openheimer"" was supposed to be a cinematic masterpiece, exploring the fascinating life of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the development of the atomic bomb. However, it turned out to be an utter disappointment, leaving me questioning why I wasted my precious time and money on this cinematic catastrophe.First and foremost, the screenplay was a complete mess. The story lacked coherence and failed to provide any meaningful insights into Oppenheimer's character or the historical events surrounding the atomic bomb project. It felt like the writers had no idea what they were doing and were merely patching together random scenes without any logical connection.The pacing of the film was torturous, to say the least. It dragged on for what seemed like an eternity, with scenes that were either excessively long and tedious or confusingly rushed. The lack of a clear narrative arc left me struggling to maintain interest throughout the movie.The casting choices were equally disastrous. While talented actors can sometimes elevate a mediocre script, that was not the case here. The lead actor's portrayal of Oppenheimer was bland and unconvincing, failing to capture the complexity and intensity of the renowned physicist. Supporting characters were poorly developed and often served as mere placeholders, with their talents wasted in this forgettable production.To make matters worse, the film's production value was abysmal. The shoddy cinematography and lackluster set designs made it difficult to immerse oneself in the period the movie was attempting to portray. The lack of attention to historical accuracy was jarring, and it felt like the filmmakers were indifferent to doing justice to the real-life events they were trying to depict.Perhaps the most insulting aspect of ""Openheimer"" was its treatment of the atomic bomb's moral implications. The movie barely scratched the surface of the ethical dilemmas surrounding the development and use of such a devastating weapon. It was a missed opportunity to explore the complex and profound impact that this momentous event had on humanity.Overall, ""Openheimer"" is an unmitigated disaster that fails on almost every level. Its lackluster script, poor pacing, subpar performances, and disregard for historical accuracy make it one of the worst cinematic experiences I have ever endured. Save yourself the agony and avoid this film at all costs."
"As ""Oppenheimer"" (2023 release; 180 min.) opens, we are introduced to Robert Oppenheimer, generally known as the ""father of the atomic bomb"". Oppenheimer is being interrogated by some congressional subcommittee in 1954, at the peak of McCartyism, for his alleged links to communist people and causes. We then go to Cambridge, England where Oppenheimer is doing his graduate studies... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest oeuvre (don't call it just a film from writer-producer-director Christopher Nolan. Let me state upfront that I am a huge fan of his works, and that surely he is one of the leading filmmakers of this generation. I absolutely loved Tenet, Dunkirk and Inception, just to name those. As you can imagine, with all of the critical acclaim and box office success this movie has been getting, I came to the theater with pretty high expectations. What I saw on the big screen did not match my expectations, I'm sorry to say. I never felt truly engaged by the movie. I never felt emotionally invested in Oppenheimer the man. On top of that, the movie seemingly went on forever. This negates the fine leaf performance from Cillian Murphy, and several others. I had hoped to see this in XD (the biggest screen at Cinemark), but alas by this weekend (the 3rd weekend of its release), ""Oppenheimer"" was relegated to a regular screen, unfortunately. Bottom line: is Oppenheimer a 'bad' movie? Of course not. But I can only tell you that my high expectations were not met, and that this wasn't nearly as enjoyable as Nolan's other recent releases.""Oppenheimer"" was released several weeks ago on the same day as ""Barbie"", creating a ""Barbenheimer"" effect that benefitted both movies. ""Oppenheimer"" has received nearly universal critical acclaim and I expect that it will be in the running for many awards when the awards season rolls along. If you are a fan of Christopher Nolan's earlier works, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion."
"I was eager to watch ""Oppenheimer"" with high hopes of experiencing an engaging and insightful depiction of one of the most critical scientific figures in history. However, I was left deeply disappointed by the film, which fell far short of my expectations.The movie fails to capture the essence and complexity of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life and contributions to the world. Rather than delving into the intriguing details of his scientific genius and the moral dilemmas surrounding the development of the atomic bomb, the film becomes an incoherent mess of disconnected scenes and poorly developed characters.One of the most glaring issues with ""Oppenheimer"" is the lackluster portrayal of the protagonist himself. The character development is superficial, and we are left with a one-dimensional portrayal of Oppenheimer that does no justice to his intellect, ambition, or internal struggles. The film misses a golden opportunity to showcase the man behind the science, leaving audiences unattached to the central figure and disengaged from the story.Furthermore, the pacing of the film is disjointed, making it challenging to follow the narrative coherently. It jumps from one event to another without proper context, leaving the audience perplexed and struggling to connect the dots. The lack of a well-structured timeline makes it difficult to grasp the significant historical events surrounding Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project.While the cinematography is visually appealing, it is not enough to compensate for the film's numerous shortcomings. The director seems more focused on artistic aesthetics rather than delivering a compelling and meaningful narrative. As a result, the film feels more like a collection of visually pleasing shots than a coherent and captivating storytelling experience.Additionally, the supporting characters are underdeveloped and do not add any depth or substance to the overall plot. The interactions between characters lack authenticity and fail to evoke any emotional connection with the audience.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" falls short of being a gripping historical drama, failing to bring life to the fascinating story of a brilliant scientist in the tumultuous times of World War II. The lack of character development, disjointed storytelling, and underutilized supporting cast render this film unimpressive and forgettable. Regrettably, I must give ""Oppenheimer"" a one-star rating for its inability to live up to its potential and engage its viewers.Save your time and seek out other well-crafted historical films that do justice to the subjects they portray. ""Oppenheimer"" fails to leave a lasting impression, making it an unfortunate disappointment for those seeking an enriching cinematic experience."
"I'm gonna break it down very simply.Pros:
1) Good Cast
2) good cinematographyCons:
1) Unnecessarily long (3 hours)
2) confusing and disjointed story telling
3) lack of character developmentHere you have it!Decent movie but didn't live up to the hype! I really expected more based on the director, cast, and story but the movie couldn't gel all alternating periods of time in a cohesive and lucid manner. I really wasn't invested at all in the movie due to my confusion and lack of personal investment in the characters since the movie falls extremely short on one being able to sympathize or feelings any emotional connection to the characters.Final thought:Worth a watch but don't go out of your way to see this movie."
"Oppenheimer from which I had expectations and waited for so long was more a documentary. 1/3rd black and white 1/3rd historical facts and 1/3rd indecipherable wannabe movie making trying to give it a drama masterpiece look. Movie lovers think it was a documentary, documentary lovers think it was a movie. In my opinion total hodgepodge to confuse but would definitely break the bank. Acting was weak, even though resemblances matter but poor acting would only earn and not be long lasting as a movie to be reckoned with. In short a documovie would be the right word instead of entertainment. A solid 3/10 from me."
"Now I know that what I might say might be a tad bit controversial... but I genuinely for the life of me do not understand how people are giving this film such high reviews and Barbie such low reviews. I watched these two films together (started with Barbie and then Oppenheimer) and wholeheartedly speaking Barbie comes on top (there was depth to the characters, the performances were amazing, the storyline brilliant, the emotions and humor tugged at your heartstrings). The same cannot be said for Oppenheimer. The film was good, not amazing but good. The cinematography was fantastic, performances brilliant. However, at 3 hours long the film did not keep my attention, if anything I fell asleep only to wake up towards the middle of the movie which is why I'm giving my score of 7/10. The storyline dragged, the characters were written well but were tiring to watch at times. I would say wait for the film to come out on Apple TV and rent it from there."
"The most important and potent line is used so early and during an unnecessary scene. Nolan has surly lost the plot.In ""Oppenheimer,"" directorial maestro Nolan sought to bring the life of one of history's most enigmatic figures, J. Robert Oppenheimer, to the silver screen. Unfortunately, this much-anticipated biopic fails to live up to the immense hype surrounding it. Despite the promise of exploring the tumultuous life of the brilliant physicist who played a pivotal role in the creation of the atomic bomb, the movie falls flat in execution, leaving audiences underwhelmed and disappointed.The film begins on a promising note, introducing us to a Oppenheimer, portrayed with remarkable dedication by a talented Murphy. The portrayal of Oppenheimer's early years and his academic pursuits shows some potential, but as the narrative progresses, it becomes evident that Johnson struggles to find a compelling and coherent direction for the movie.One of the film's primary downfalls is its meandering pace and lack of focus. Instead of delving deep into the complexities of Oppenheimer's character, the movie frequently sidetracks into irrelevant subplots and meager character developments. While the desire to humanize Oppenheimer is evident, the script often feels forced and clichéd, doing little to shed new light on the man behind the bomb.Furthermore, the film's supporting cast, despite notable actors, is woefully underused and fails to make a significant impact. Characters such as General Leslie Groves and Edward Teller are reduced to one-dimensional caricatures, robbing the movie of potential opportunities for conflict and intrigue.Perhaps the most egregious misstep of ""Oppenheimer"" lies in its portrayal of the scientific endeavor. One would expect a movie about the father of the atomic bomb to delve into the scientific process and the ethical dilemmas surrounding the creation of such a weapon. Regrettably, the film merely skims the surface, sacrificing substance for unfulfilling melodrama.The cinematography and production design are passable, providing a visually acceptable backdrop to the lackluster narrative. However, these technical achievements cannot save the film from its fundamental flaw: overhyping a movie that fails to live up to its grandiose promises.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" falls prey to the dangers of overhype. While the premise had the potential to be a gripping exploration of the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the film fails to deliver on its lofty aspirations. A disjointed script, lackluster characterizations, and a failure to tackle the ethical and scientific complexities of the atomic bomb's creation prevent ""Oppenheimer"" from becoming the biopic masterpiece it aspired to be. Regrettably, it ends up being a mere fizzle in the realm of nuclear cinema.Could have been an excellent HBO mini series but Nolan pulled a D&D GOT style on us and thus it felt rushed."
"But it wasn't boring for me. Its just that every bloody talking scene had some poor sod on a violin doing tension music. Completely lost track of the plot here and there (so many people and lts of mumbling). But good performances all round esp Downey.I suppose my overriding thought is, to quote the film, ""nobody in Hiroshima or Nagasaki cares who invented the bloody bomb."" I guess I don't either. And he had a conscience. And problems with women. And a troubled childhood that was ignored in the filmIts like Nolan was worried it would be boring so peppered it with nipples, tricks and gimmicks.I saw it on Imax and that was a waste of money - I was not blown away. We went home and re-watched the documentary. Fascinating story."
"First time I've ever nodded off in a cinema. Firstly, the film is WAY too long. The characters are pretty much universally unlikeable and it is chock full of meandering wramblings from the McCarthy era mascinations.There is no edge of the seat narrative, and I know that this is not the subject for that. However, there should be some entertainment in a feature film that long.Overpowering musical score basically drowning out everything else didn't help.The Prestige is one of my favourite films that stands up to repeated viewing time and time again. Oppenheimer though visually spectacular in some aspects had me longing for the end. Disappointing."
"There have been numerous dramatizations about the building of the bomb. Certain movies were bombs themselves (Fat Man and Little Boy). I was expecting the movie to centralize around the work going into building the first atomic bomb. Instead, it is really only the backdrop for a biography about Oppenheimer. Nolan and the screenwriters spiced up his story, using a hearing with flashbacks as the narrative structure. That type of structure allows the film to jump around in time, following the impacts of a decision throughout his life. Jumping around is definitely Nolan's directing style. It keeps the pacing fast, and helps to parse out portions of the film that would have otherwise become static if told in linear fashion. This is the case of the hearing. It is conducted in a small and uninteresting room as a location. Same for the many many conversations about being engaged in politics.One review mentioned the directing style resembling Martin Scorcese. The ""Goodfellas"" director was the pioneer of the hyper-pacing when telling a story. Nolan perhaps might feel that Michael Bay syndrome of quick cutting to force the audience to keep watching by subjecting them to some new stimulus every few seconds. Nolan probably justifies the quick cutting knowing that this is meant to be a summer tentpole film, which needs to resemble a roller coaster ride. So you get a lot of big music cues, big scenes, a big group of side characters, and just a little tiny bit of humour. Adding the right amount of humour is extremely important for a script that wants be a serious drama. Too many yucks can decrease the amount of gravitas to the story. Too little humour keeps the audience in an emotional rut. They need to have a bit of levity once in a while, especially when the movie gets heavy handed. Matt Damon plays the general in charge of the Manhattan Project. As seen in the trailer, his heavy handed character almost gets to the point of over-acting. Thankfully he is allowed to be more than one dimensional. There still is the memory of Paul Newman playing Damon's character in ""Fat Man and Little Boy"". That movie made many bad decisions, one was to make Paul Newman an overdrawn movie villain.As I sat through the three hour running time, something occurred to me that was a revelation, I could actually hear and understand the dialogue! Finally someone convinced Nolan to turn the music down a bit. The music score must have been a huge undertaking. I think few people realise the amount of man hours it takes to go over footage only a few minutes at a time and carve out a music cue that encompasses many factors (character, story, location, time of day, mood, etc.), and not become derivative or repetitious. Ludwig Goransson displays a wide breadth of musical knowledge that Hans Zimmer never had. He uses a musical palette of many instruments and styles (including Zimmer).So the story gets around to the actual event of setting off the atomic bomb. I don't know why, but Nolan didn't want a computer simulation. The practical version failed to really invoke a sense of awe. Unless... Nolan wanted this movie to be less about the bomb, and as such only give scant details on its production, along with the tedious aspects of testing for two years. This film finds a lot of good intelligent interaction with the supporting characters, many are whom are physicists. The final act of the film focuses on the aftermath of the birth of the atomic age. We see how those other characters react to the event as well as to the pressure of politics. The red scare back then made it easy to make scapegoats out of innocent people.So of course you are asking, does it fail the two hour rule? Does this film justify its three hour running time? If you are Martin Scorcese, you can justify a longer running time, like ""The Departed"", because you are condensing an even larger story. Such is the case here, mostly. As important as politics are, I feel audiences don't find it entertaining.The supporting characters do a fine job of filling out the scope of this film. The film jumps around from Europe to Ivy League college campuses to the New Mexico desert. Meaningful conversations are written with a certain eloquence in mind. In other words, a lot of thought was put into the dialogue to add more subtlety about the greater meaning of what they are saying. Robert Downey Jr. Does a great transformation into a man who was the first commissioner of the Atomic Energy Commission. Not a very exciting man, thus played in a relaxed fashion by Downey. Emily Blunt has very little screen time in this film. Not much is explored about their marriage, and she has few lines for such a prominent actress in a seemingly prominent role. There are other familiar faces that pop up, which I won't spoil the fun. Cillian Murphy plays the role of his career. By far, Oppenheimer is a complex character, and some odd behaviour is shown. Murphy seems to be always in deep thought, and somewhat disassociated with the kind of everyday life most people have. Like being a proper parent.There was some light applause at the end of the nearly sold out showing I went to. Here is a chance to learn about an interesting piece of history, and in the process experience a refreshing break from the summer blockbuster sequel assembly line. I would only say some parts of the story could have been condensed even more, such as some of the politics. Nolan is certainly developing a reputation for retelling stories in a more exciting way. Many see Nolan transitioning into a serious director with Dunkirk and now this historical piece. Such as his inclusion of nudity (for the first time?) in one his films. There needs to be an artistic approach that makes sense when showing nudity, and Nolan shows that kind of maturity here.7 out of 10."
"Was bored in first hour and stopped watching it pretty much boring and hard to follow It was not as dope as I thought it could be i didn't enjoy watching it especially for 3 hours straight seems impossible i recommend watching chernobyl instead it was far more impressive whereas i ended up reading a wikipedia page rather than wasting 2 more hours for nonsense

"The film was long, scattered in plot and underwhelming. Felt like they tried to make up for it with consistently dramatic music and surprising nudity.Pros:
Murphy and RDJ acted wellCool effects for Oppenheimers Quantum mechanic visionsCons:Long dramatic buildup to an underwhelming detonation and depiction of the blast. (We never got to see the full scale of the blast, only portions of it... the silence after detonation felt like an eternity - it took too long for the blast wave to finally reach Murphy and team)Multiple confusing plot lines it was hard to compartmentalize what the main message of the film was.Confusing start to the filmUnnecessarily loud dramatic music and nudity."
"Oppenheimer is a film that tries to explore the life and work of the man behind the atomic bomb, but fails to deliver a compelling story or a satisfying conclusion. The film is too long, too slow, and too dense with technical and historical details that only a physics or politics student would appreciate. The characters are bland and unrelatable, the dialogue is dry and dull, and the cinematography is uninspired and boring. The film does not do justice to the complexity and controversy of Oppenheimer's legacy, nor does it offer any insight or emotion to the audience. Oppenheimer is a film that should have been left in the lab. One good scene which was impressive but left me very sober. It was anxiety inducing. Then 30 more minutes and I just hoped the movie will end. It's not just a ""problem"" with Oppenheimer but I noticed with other movies with similar running time. Even The Batman which I loved was slightly too long. Not exactly the same goes with Oppenheimer I felt like an editor and wanted to cut out the last 20 minutes. The movie could have ended on a more impressive note than it actually did. I also didn't really like Nolan's typical beige filter in it. The B/W segments felt refreshing. Weirdly my cinema's 70mm film projector went broke after 30 minutes in. (The first nude scene with Florence Pugh and Cillian Murphy). They talked about Freud and Jung and the movie was paused for 20 minutes, just to be replaced by the digital backup. That was an interesting experience. It was my first time seeing a movie in analog and I guess it was also a first time for a long time for the theater. It has its charms. The grain. The white flicker between cuts and the slight stroboscopic effect like a flip book. Anyways. That's all."
"Unexceptional film making. I found it to be both anxious and oppressive as it relentlessly jumps continuously through what can only be described as long and exhausting. It's 3 hour runtime is taxing, fragmented and crawls by. This movie could be an hour less without having any real effect on the story. It is challenging to watch and will easily get away from the viewer.We are introduced to the father of the atomic bomb and the question of whether he was a communist or not. Theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer is recruited by the United States government to oversee a top secret operation intended to develop the world's first atomic bomb. The film attempts to convey the complexities of World War 2, cold war history, and to bring a quick end to the war. These are truly some of the most important events and questions of the 20th century and how it still affects everyone decades later.I'm left with the feeling that Oppenheimer just doesn't deliver. I certainly don't feel the need to rush out and see it again anytime soon. In fact, I'm sure I won't ever endure the painful 3 hour experience again. I guess I was expecting something a little more entertaining."
"The movie is okay. Wasted in IMAX. The music production is at best, oppressive, intrusive and a distraction from what are great actors doing their thing. The script might have multiple layers but it lacks conflict, an inciting incident and a meaningful resolution. It's linear, which biopics tend to be, but it's not a 'story'. Flawed genius? Perhaps or just an unfaithful man - not ground breaking and it lacked a real reason to 'be'. It might have been better if Heisenberg and Oppenheimer were enemies instead of friends or some personal conflict existed that resulted in a winner. Here the movie falls flat and tries to use over bearing music to fill a void left by a lifeless underdramatic script.Murphy is great but too many cameos by so many stars became distracting with characters lacking depth or development.You will glance at your watch more than once.A shame."
"Not unlike Nolan's other films this is a Movie that must be seen more than once to fully grasp. The movie is a dialogue heavy biopic that focuses on Oppenheimer's moral struggles but the story is told by jumping between different timelines throughout the entire film which makes it unnecessarily convoluted.Although the film is mostly a talkie, the soundtrack was not so different from The Dark Knight's which I found to be overly dramatic and very unfitting. I also found the acting to be overly dramatic as well when it would be just characters talking to each other.One last con is that the movie is 3 hrs long and it doesn't need to be that long, add to that the nonlinear story telling and it becomes a tough film to sit through.All cons aside, the film still has some of the best and most iconic scenes of the year, so if you're interested in the subject material I strongly recommend it but you need to go in with expectations that you are going into a 3 hr long talkie and not a summer action filled blockbuster."
"The expectations that go into a Nolan film have obviously affected the end product of most of his more recent efforts, so much so that the great potential story of one of the most significant technological events in history becomes poorly told.From a historical perspective, so many significant events from the development of atomic weapons are left out, such as Heisenberg (Germany) almost killing himself during his own experiments, the exodus of great scientists to the US preceding the Nazi uprising, the Demon Core incidents after the War, and the celebrity status Oppenheimer achieved after the War. Zero historical footage is used in this film, which is worse for it as so much amazing stuff could be repurposed here. We aren't even allowed to feel anything about the atrocities of Germany, Japan, or the USSR at the time. In fact, a key reason Truman wanted to end the war with the bomb quickly was to keep the Soviets from making a mess of post-war Japan by claiming lands by invasion, which would have led to a partly communist Japan to this day.From a science perspective, little is told about the development of the bombs themselves, including the obstacles the scientists really faced and the achievements they made. No mention of the idea that the technology could also be used to save the world (nuclear power), being reason enough to push forward with the research, aside from keeping it out of Germany's hands, which was a real concern of the government.As such, this isn't a documentary. Not at all. Any of the aforementioned stuff would have made for a brilliant Nolan film...but I don't see him capable of makes a film with real science and history.Neither is it a character study, as the biopic title suggests. Rather it's a vehicle for Nolan to edit together trailer-type cuts across changing timelines for 3 hours. I found it tiresome and frenetic. While the acting is good, none of it makes us feel anything for the characters. While there was an opportunity to work on the morality angle for Oppenheimer, which was very much what the real man was about, the film glosses over this to focus only on the politics of the time, where the McCarthy era witch-hunts ended Oppenheimer's career as a quantum physicist. Even then, Nolan misses an opportunity to vilify those actions by the government, making no real statements there.The result of the 3 hours is the simple message that the genie cannot be put back in the bottle, and in Oppenheimer's mind, would end in our destruction.That said, all the high grades for this film come from Nolan fanboys, who write pretentious reviews for pretentious films."
"My first impression of Oppenheimer was just how loud it all was. Not to criticize the beautiful tones found throughout, but the heaviness and intensity of the music never relented, except for an inevitable central sequence when we finally, mercifully, get a moment of silence. Silence between the pieces of score, and silence between hours of continuous, hyper-paced dialogue and sound design, which all combined sometimes approaches cacophony.The noise of it all sometimes seems an attempt to compensate for a misplaced idea that an audience wouldn't be able to sustain interest in this material without the distraction of a continuous soundtrack. I wish it would have appreciated more moments of quiet. And ironically, in spite of its relentlessness, Oppenheimer ends up the slowest, and most demanding of all Christopher Nolan films.This is not a bad thing. This film is full of smart, engrossing material and succeeds as a rich retelling of Oppenheimer's legacy and the vast network of brains who helped make his Manhattan Project a reality. Multiple viewings are warranted. The cast is spectacular and good use is overall made of them (when we can pin an actor down long enough to even notice their presence), and I can't really blame Nolan anyway, for wanting to spruce up hours of granular physics, debates and testimony into something as awesome as possible.Nolan's movies are gorgeous contraptions, made with exquisite care and a love of an old school sort of practical filmmaking, and they're always ambitious, always outsized. This movie left me with an odd feeling, which is that it was both too long and not long enough. Not long enough to really pierce the enormous scope of what Oppenheimer's life stood for against history, and yet full and stylized almost beyond the brim."
"I went to this movie with maybe too high expectations. I loved Nolan's work so far, with Interstellar as my all time favorite movie. Seeing the ratings and read the user reviews i really thought this couldn't go wrong.Nothing seems to be the case. I've seen it last night and all morning i am wondering where the high ratings come from. I have watched a documentary for 3 long long hours, without any excitement . The bomb explosion scene was the only good thing in this movie, all the rest is plain boring chatter with 4 different storylines running trough each other. Nolan added a black and white storyline because he must have realized that most of the people otherwise wouldn't get anything of the movie at all.I really hate to say it : Don't waste your time to go see it. You're warned."
"""Oppenheimer 2023"" is a well-directed film, but it may be overly complicated for some viewers. The film will likely appeal to history buffs who are already familiar with the historical character, but casual movie watchers may find themselves tuning out a quarter of the way in. The sex scenes with Pugh seem shoehorned into the movie that didn't need them and don't add much to the overall narrative. Without these scenes, the film could have been rated PG-13 and made available to a wider audience. Overall, if you're into historical narratives, this film is for you. However, if you're just looking for entertainment, you may find yourself checking the clock."
"Come on, after 1h30 I was hoping someone would shot Oppenheimer and the movie would end. This is way too long. It could have been an interesting movie of 2h (not saying good). Productors are lucky Nolan is directing and there is a very good cast otherwise that would be a complete failure. I believe this movie benefits from the social media factor where nobody thinks anymore and just repeats. A few ""influencers"" have manipulated the mass of zombies not thinking for themselves and now it is cool to see this movie and to brag about it. Well I left the movie after 2 hours. Too slow, I have better things to do with my life...."
"This movie being shot in 70mm IMAX film doesn't make any sense once I watched it, the movie itself isn't very cinematic. Additionally the film throws around so many names and characters it makes it very hard to follow dialogue and story. I walked out being confused and a little underwhelmed. Near the end, the movie will lose most of the audience with all of the concepts, characters and lawsuits style scenes the last for a third of the movie. Personally the movie got worse and worse, with looser plot and story as it went. The one thing I well give Nolan is the sound design and ost, so goddamn good, it's my favorite part. Lastly, it felt like the whole movie revolved and written around the ending quote in the movie."
"I fed into all of the hype and was extremely excited to watch this film. I will never get these 3 hours of my life back. In my opinion there was only one good scene and that was the explosion. The rest of the film is a convoluted mess with all the characters shaping up to be completely uninteresting(except for Oppenheimer himself) The acting was rather good but it doesn't matter when the characters are uninteresting. I've seen many movies and I think this takes the cake for the movie that was the least gripping/entertaining. How can you be expected to pay attention to a 3 hour dialogue slog of a movie when you can barely hear the actors talking? I don't think it was a theatre issue but if it was I apologize. The film is only good for about 10 mins, 1/10 should have seen Barbie."
"Having forced myself to sit through ""Interstellar"" (2014), I was forewarned that this Auteur was more committed to the arty than to art. This episodic movie offers random scenes from the life of the father of the atom bomb at a very important historical moment. President Joe Biden has announced that we are at the brink of ""Nuclear Armageddon,"" so this is a worthy contribution to a rich genre that began with Arch Obler's ""Five"" (1951). Its major virtue is the portrayal of the ant-Communist hysteria of the 1940s, which preordained the present anti-Maga hysteria, both crazes united in their conviction that nuclear war with Russia is probably inevitable, especially now that Russian agents, pretending to be Americans, are among us. The brief portrait of the diminutive haberdasher from Independence is highly amusing. Movie directors are tyrants on the set and in the theatres, where they may require 180 minutes of undivided attention, but, here, it's worth a sitting."
"After having seen the high ratings, the interviews with the cast and the trailer, I was looking forward to see an accurate depiction of an important part of history, still shaping our world today.But the actual movie has nothing to do with the trailer; 2/3 of it deals with endless interrogations after the war about Oppenheimer's possible old communist links and his refusal to cooperate with the H-bomb development, so to find an excuses to revoke his security clearance and side-line him. And this in endless time-jumps back and forth.The actual 1/3 of the movie that deals with the development of the ""gadget"", the theory behind it and the practical problems to turn various theories into reality was only lightly addressed, barely scratching the surface of the development, the technical difficulties, the logistics, the organisation and the timeline.True, the film is called ""Oppenheimer"" and not ""Trinity"", ""the Bomb"", etc, but I felt that for 2 out of the 3 hours I was attending some courtroom interrogation about Oppenheimer, not a movie about the man and his team developing the technology while admitting various levels of doubt, guilt, conscience, etc.Yes the acting was very good, Cillian Murphy, but also, to my surprise, Matt Damon.But overall, this movie does not at all represent, in my humble opinion, what it is being sold to be."
The film is more about personal vendattas and attempts to grab political benefits than about the discovery itself.Much of the film is about hearings to damage Oppenheimer's reputation and career and the downfall of the person who did it.I hate to say it but it was a little boring. It's beautifully shot and superbly acted and not a bad film at all but for me it was a bit cowardly.I disagree with the reviews that say it brought up important ethical dilemmas and issues. The film only ever so briefly touches upon them. In fact the damage the bomb did is barely mentioned and the ethics are given a cursory glance at best. The only ethics I think it did quite well was to question if Oppenheimer really had an issue with continued and developed nuclear bombs for moral reasons or if it was about him retaining power.
"Sorry but it just doesn't live up to the pre-game hype! And not worth the extra for an IMAX viewing of bland deserts and chalkboards full of maths symbols!Yes it tells a story of a complicated man, but too many stories jumping around back and forth with music score so overbearing in places was starting to give me a headache (earplugs stopped me walking out for a break)Strange though, with nearly three hours runtime, Nolan chose not to put a single Japanese actor in for a few scenes from their perspective in the aftermath?For me Downey Jr gave a standout performance as did Damon. Blunt's low amount of screen time was noticeable, as the wife in support of a brilliant but boring cerebral genius, who fared little better than Churchill in the post war years!Will watch again on the small screen to go back over details missed, in all that loud music & scene jumping.."
"Oppenheimer is a captivating war film that takes its audience on a mesmerizing journey through the life and times of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist and key figure in the development of the atomic bomb. The movie's standout feature is undoubtedly Cillian Murphy's exceptional performance, which is nothing short of remarkable. His portrayal of Oppenheimer brings depth and intensity to the character, elevating the overall impact of the film.The storyline and underlying theories explored in Oppenheimer are praiseworthy. The movie delves into the moral and ethical dilemmas faced by scientists involved in the creation of such a powerful and devastating weapon. It deftly highlights the inner conflict within Oppenheimer and his colleagues as they grapple with the consequences of their actions."
"Not gonna say it was a bad movie. But it was average at best. Despite the amazing acting, the movie falls short in every other aspect. The short scenes and continuous cutting and shifting from past to future where some scenes didn't serve any purpose or help to understand in fact it makes you more lost alongside the unnecessary characters. All of the previous added the 40-50 extra minutes that made it a boring film. Disappointed mainly because of the hype around it. But honestly a movie mainly about ""bombs"" had 1 bomb scene, and 90% was just meetings of people grilling each other with load music in the background."
"I went in with a lot of expectation. Knowingly that this is a biography and it's based on an actual event that we already knew - an invention that changed the course of the world.So with a stacked casts consisting of some of the greatest actors of our time, 3-hour run time and all the hype surround this film, I came out feeling hollow and confused!It's overly long - the run time could be cut short to 2-hour or 2-hour 15 at most. The runtime and subplot are overstuffed!It's over-stylized - too many time jump (Nolan's signature) but I don't see the need of deploying this. It's overused and VERY SELF-INDULGING!!! And then... there is these black and white scenes that are supposed to represent something. I don't know what I'm suppose to watch, one moment I'm given the lecture on science and physics but the next it's all bureaucratic and political and conspiracies. And then there's drama and affair. It's just too much! I like movies that are non-linear, to serve the purpose of storytelling and for the twist. But this one, just NO!It's overblown - and overhyped. I know this movie is about atomic bomb and its impact to humanity but I cannot feel the real impact of it for the most part. Probably only towards the last 1 hour. The explosion scene is supposed to be the climax but I didn't feel it that way.At some point in the cinema, I felt like I needed to look up Oppenheimer on wikipedia and get over with it rather than to sit through the remaining hours of self-indulging piece of work that some may call it art. Yes maybe it is, perhaps too artistic to the point I don't know how to appreciate it?To be fair, the acting is really good but I somehow often got distracted with the overly long dialogues. It reminds me of Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds long dialogue but Nolan did not pull this one off!Great production, yes. But I can't say the same for the screenplay.Cinematography is beautiful but the jump cut to the ""imagination"" (supposedly) of the lead character is more distracting than it is to serve its purpose.Not forgetting also the soundtrack. It's trying to make the audience feel tensed but it did not do anything to me. I felt it's more distracting to me than to make me feel tensed or engaged.I'm a fan of Christopher Nolan's earlier works. Like Memento and Inception, both are very original and groundbreaking. Batman, Dark Knight and The Prestige are great movies.But not this one! So distracting that I kept looking at my watch and I'm struggling to connect with the story.It's like a bomb that did not detonate."
"I saw OPPENHEIMER in 70-millimeter format. I wish I had liked it better, but I didn't. What I disliked most about it was the soundtrack. There was INCESSANT background noise that rumbled and roared and thudded (with a lot of Sensurround-style vibration) throughout the film. Sometimes it drowned out the actors, several of whom were hard for me to understand in the first place. The style of the photography was also off-putting. To make it seem like a documentary or a period-piece, sections of it were filmed in black-and-white or used filters to deaden the colors. I think all these gimmicks were there to disguise the fact that the script wasn't really very focused and was 3 hours long. The script is based on true historical events, and reality isn't easily shoehorned into a coherent plot. It was never clear to me exactly what the point was. There are a lot of good actors in this movie, but I didn't know who they were until I saw the credits! I still think of Matt Damon and Robert Downey Junior as young men, and they're NOT! I thought Downey gave the best performance in the film, though. The art direction and costume design seemed to accurately depict the period, although thanks to the cinematography, we'll never know what the true colors of anything were. (I wonder if the film-maker told these people that he was going to use stylized cinematography beforehand, or whether they found out when they saw the film.) I admire the film's ambition, and I think the issues it raises are things that people should think about, but I wonder if it would have been better if they had just told the story."
"Cillian Murphy offers an assured and considered performance here as the man who is credited with developing the bomb that hastened the end of WWII in the far east. He is the increasingly acclaimed, eponymous, physicist who is made aware by Admiral Lewis Strauss (another strong performance from Robert Downey Jr.) that it just possible that the Russians have the A-bomb. Now Oppenheimer already suspects that the Nazis are also well on their way to weaponising the atom - his earlier education and career had introduced him to some of the prominent minds in the UK and in Germany who were quite capable of taking the theory forward; so he begins to pressurise the American government to begin it's own programme - and the ""Manhattan Project"" is born. Motivated/goaded/galvanised by the ambitious ""Col. Groves"" (Matt Damon) he assembles a formidable collection of scientific minds at a purpose built, desert, location which he christens Los Alamos, and over the next three years - and with $2bn to spend - they work on the science whilst plutonium and uranium are being simultaneously processed at an irkingly glacial pace! Given that much of this is reasonably well documented history, the actual plot here has little by way of jeopardy. Instead, Christopher Nolan attempts via his writing and direction to put some meat on the bones of the characters here. It's clear that Oppenheimer is a bit of a Lothario, but it's also clear that he can engender the loyalty of a variety of people with diverging views - not just surrounding the science of their project, but around the morals and ethics of creating something that - well, you can't get the toothpaste back into the tube. The latter portion of this drama focusses on the subsequent, communist-obsessed, witch-hunting that went on attempting to persecute and smear this remarkable and flawed individual, and it makes some interesting postulations about just who was pulling whose strings. It also has quite a penetrating resonation about it - not just, specifically, about Oppeneheimer - but about all of those post-event ""enquiries"" that rarely deliver an honest appraisal of what was done in the name of expediency at the time, but ends up more of a character assassination exercise by those who didn't do anything against those who did and had to. Though at times the pace of this thing helps to keep it enthralling, it is too long - at times it really does plod along. Perhaps an other, objective, eye on the writing/direction may have tightened it up without having to sacrifice any of the potency of the story. Maybe someone needs to tell Mr. Nolan that a three hour film isn't always required! That said, it's a gorgeous film to look at. The aesthetics are first rate and the entire sentiment of the film reeks of authenticity. I do think this thrives better on a big screen so try to see it as it was intended. It's though provoking, complex, characterful - and well worth a watch."
"98% of the 3-hour long movie was talking, interrogating, flashing back and forth and some unnecessary sex scenes. Didn't show the bomb making process, how it was used, the aftermath. Yes of course I can Goggle for my own interest but that was the impression from all the hype and false advertising from this movie! The movie was super boring I couldn't wait for it to be over! Also Lewis Strauss played by Robert Downey Jr. Was very annoying, guy kept fixing his tie, button / unbutton and putting on and taking off his jacket, so pretentious! I regret taking my whole family to see this hyped up movie! Don't fall for this hype and this is definitely not appropriate for teens and younger."
"Not sure if I was sleep deprived but I found the film somewhat grating. The score was great but relentless and too loud, it was hard to decipher the dialogue. The shots were very short and choppy. There was a lot of dialogue, so much so that it required an exorbitant amount of focus and got tiring very quickly. I understand the reason why they didn't depict the bombings on Japan as the film did not wish to glorify the bombings in any way. Running length was far too long.The psychological evaluation of Oppenheimer was very astute. The film reads as more of a psychological study of his mind and involves a lot of courtroom drama (he said, she said type of stuff). It is not an action film or even a historical biopic in my opinion."
"My first review ever on here. And its is a warning. This movie is terrible.This movie had so much potential. With a 3 hour run time I expected dialog. I didn't expect 95% of the movie to just be dialog!I was expecting this to be somewhat like the HBO show Chernobyl but with the budget of a big time movie by Nolan. That show had good dialog along with great scenes of what happened after the meltdown.I was expecting the same from this movie. It is almost disrespectful to not show the anguish it caused and it would play into how Oppenheimer was haunted by the Manhattan project.Instead they did not show anything other than the testing of the atomic bomb and tried to show Oppenheimer as a victim rather than the engineer of death. So many missed opportunities, and to the point where it was flat out boring."
"First of this is a good film and (as far as I can gather) generally accurateWith a plethora of stars, many in small parts, the acting is very goodThe first 2 hours go by in a whiz as I was totally enthralled, totally absorbedThis film is beautifully crafted and acted where it (dare I say it) goes slighly awry, is it is just soooooo long.I have to admit in the last 30 minutes I was wishing it would end. It's a bit of a marathon to watch and begins to run out of steam in the last part.Therefore for the first 2 hrs 8/10 but overall 7.5/10Would I watch this again ? No, for me it's a watch once (and well worth a watch) but i'm unlikely to do so again."
"When it was good it was amazing but those occasional 20 mins of nothing just made it draaaaaagg but i saw another review say there were 3 really great scenes (you'll know the ones once you watch them) and how they're incredible but overall despite the scenes it went on for too long completely. 3 hours which essentially was 1 hour of incredible cinema and 2 of just confusing timelines, millions of physicists who all blend into one and florence pugh having 2 s** scenes and a slewer slide scene (really weird she actually took on the role tbh) but yeah prefered barbie tbh and ik shouldn't be compared but marketing really messed up releasing on same day so not really my fault! And befor letterboxd nerds say that barbie was just dopamine enjoyable and just cuz oppenheimer isn't constant fun doesn't mean it's worse : no! Ur wrong and idc."
Great movie but the hype is jus too much! The screen presentation is excellent but way too many conversations and talks rather than action and story . The scene in and out from past to the present makes it very difficult to grasp and I feel that it Should have been simple and plain ! Why is there no scene of the bomb in Japan 🇯🇵 ? Instead the blast from the trinity makes us to crave for more ! The acting is top notch and screenplay is brilliantly impressive.The actors make their roles so very real and to life ! I feel the movie is too long and less actions or fights.... There is no scene of the war in that era or the enemy. Feels like is a documentary within a movie !
"This movie is so borimg that it should be banned!It's built arround interrogations and all we get to see is people talking in boring tones. There's no inriguing scenes, no diving into any person's life, no emotions. A biology book would be a lot more fun than this 3 hour long so called movie! I trusted the 8.8/rating so I decieed to watch this movie for our cinema night with my boyfriend. The first part was boring as f so we waited for the second part, turns out, it was the same s! I don't understand how anyone can publish or give a 10/10 rating for something like this! We were so bored that I told my boyfriend we should go out when there was 35 minutes left, he agreed and said ""Let's f go, this movie is disgusting"" out loud. After we went out, 35 people came out with us! There is no point in this movie, no story, nothing to be curious about, nothing to learn, nothing to feel. I saw only 2 good scenes, the silent test-bomb at Santa Fe, and showcasing how Oppenheimer felt inside while giving a speech to Americans about how proud he is to have bombed Japan.As someone who knew about Oppenheimer before, I expevted something a lot more interesting, teaching about quantum mecahincs, space and making us feel his loneliness, his depression and his traumas.He is basically a robot in the movie, just like every other character! I can remember I felt more intrigued when I watched his DOCUMENTARY!You can see what's so wrong about this movie if the documentary is more fun to listen to than the movie!This movie is such a killjoy. The part after getting out of the cinema at 1 AM and loudly listening to music in the var with my BF was more fun than the whole 3 hours!"
"This was definitely something I'd been looking forward to and was excited to see some 'real cinema'. What with all the excellent actors, top director, and interesting subject matter, I was ready to really 'feel something', and my initial feeling is a bit deflated, to be honest.The acting here is top quality, there's no doubt, and all the characters, of which there are what feels like millions, all have depth and plenty of important dialogue. But by the second hour, I had succumbed to the sheer volume of detailed exchanges and personal motives. They just throw it at you scene after scene, and for the first time in a movie, I wished I was at home watching a 5-part limited series where I could debate and analyze with my wife what the hell was going on at times.Christopher Knowlen is a master in my opinion because he creates such rich environments and thought-provoking movies like Interstellar and Inception that challenge the viewer while delighting them with a fast-paced story that is captivating to watch. This movie left me needing to watch it two more times to soak up every piece of detail, with none of the motivation to do it. The first 30 mins are so promising, and the visuals about the nature of reality are stunning and mind-expanding. This is short-lived before the reality of mechanics, ego, and politics are shuffled on our heads scene by scene.I will watch this movie again, I've no doubt, but not soon and not for money."
"I am a Christopher Nolan fan, particularly drawn to his original works. Biography and real-life storytelling also intrigue me, which is why I'm quite familiar with the Oppenheimer story. Based on the trailers, I believed this movie would delve into the science of bomb-making and explore Oppenheimer's emotions. In an interview, Nolan himself stated that the movie revolves around Oppenheimer, with the supporting cast merely there to complement the main character.With this expectation, I was hoping to witness Oppenheimer's inner struggles portrayed in a way that was far more personal. My desire was to experience the movie through Oppenheimer's perspective. Unfortunately, the film took a different approach, focusing more on the outside world's perception of Oppenheimer and the political entanglements, which I found to be the least interesting part of his story. Such aspects would be better suited for an actual documentary where facts and information are sought. In cinema, we crave thrilling experiences.Many have praised the film's non-CGI effects, but personally, I found the actual Trinity bomb explosion effect to be underwhelming. A movie about the atomic bomb should evoke a sense of suspense and offer the most impactful portrayal of its consequences, not just for spectacle but to evoke a deep emotional impact.As a graphic designer and animator familiar with practical effects, I can usually distinguish between CGI and practical effects. However, the close-ups of this non-CGI explosion did not thrill me.After seeing the movie, I couldn't help but wonder why it didn't take a direction more akin to 'The Imitation Game.' I yearned for a focus on the science behind creating the device and the emotional struggles that accompanied it."
"Oppenheimer isn't a bad movie. It's a good movie. It's just difficult to know just how good it is since the dialogue is constantly interrupted either by over the top sound effects or a self important and intrusive soundtrack by Ludwig Göransson. It isn't that Christopher Nolan thinks he's Michael Bay. There's only one explosion, but it is a big one. It's just that he might as well have been Michael Bay, exchanging explosions on the screen for an explosive soundtrack. I don't know if Ludwig Göransson thinks he's the new Vangelis or the next Hans Zimmer, but he is neither. They must have a great sound system in the studio's mixing room. It's just too bad the average Cineplex can't quite match it.I think he would have been better served if he had brought Zimmer onboard to do the soundtrack. He brought other people from the Batman movies. Gary Oldman is almost unrecognizable as President Harry Truman and Tom Conti is totally unrecognizable as Professor Albert Einstein. There are other Hollywood Heavyweights in other cameos as well. But they're all overshadowed by the intrusive overbearing soundtrack.If only Christopher Nolan had more respect for the audiences intelligence he might have given the dialogue a more prominent place in his film. Quantum Mechanics and Nuclear Physics are difficult enough subjects to tackle when you can hear and understand every word being said clearly and distinctly. But when you have music that is trying to create a sense of urgency and tension even in scenes where there is none, it's a bit like the snow he inserts into scenes where it isn't cold enough to see the actors breath. Obviously he is foreshadowing nuclear winter and fallout, but again, it's as intrusive as the persistent soundtrack, and more than a little ham-handed. Muck like the inserted nudity and sex scene trying to allude to Oppenheimer's life being laid bare before his detractors.Cillian Murphy's performance is excellent. Had this film been made a decade or two ago his part might well have gone to Peter Weller. He would have fit right in as the Doctor Buckaroo Banzai of the 1940s, especially when Naked Lunch like sexual and atomic hallucination intrude into the story almost as much as that bombastic soundtrack.Perhaps all the blasts of music, sound effects and shocking imagery are to keep the audience awake since you can't always hear the dialogue. Or, maybe, he thought the dialogue itself would put people to sleep, especially after the bomb is made and shipped off to Japan and the movie is only a little more than half over and the film degenerates into a courtroom drama against Oppenheimer by a Robert Downey Jr.'s bitter character, since it's filled enough science and political science to put the audience to sleep even with the intrusive music and hallucinations. It's hard to say for certain since I couldn't hear a lot of it.So I hope when the DVD comes out there will be instead of a Director's Cut, a Viewer's Cut, complete with options like a soundtrack that can be turned down. At least there will be Closed Captions, hopefully accurate ones, and not like the ones that seem be written for the deaf by the deaf. No, good ones where you can read what's actually being said. Only then will I be able to determine just how good this good movie really was. It was certainly better than the theater's sound system as it struggled to keep up. Perhaps they should resurrect the of Sensurround System from the 1970's that they used for movies like Earthquake and Midway with enough Cervwin-Vega speakers for a Grateful Dead concert. Maybe that would allow the audience to hear the dialogue above the intrusive score and atomic blasts. Otherwise it's like trying to watch a combination of a dramatic Broadway play with the entire New York Philharmonic on stage with the actors, punctuating their every line with fanfares and flourishes.Does this review seem overly long and monotonous? Well then Oppenheimer probably isn't your cup of tea. The ""courtroom stuff"" makes the ""math stuff"" seem interesting by comparison. It seems that Christopher Nolan wanted to give us an epic. It's certainly long enough to be one. But most of the film isn't IMAX worthy, even if the soundtrack requires their sound system. This could have been a Smart Movie, but I think Nolan made it just smart enough for intellectually challenged pretentious people to think it is. Or maybe I'm wrong and it's just me. But if I were you, I'd wait for the DVD, or Stream it. That way you can rewind missed dialogue and take breaks as needed in order to find out."
I'm disappointed with this movie I had gone to see this as part of the double feature and was excited. Christopher nolan never disappoints but he certainly did with this movie. To put it simply about an hour of this movie could have been shaved off there were parts in the film where nobody can hear what the character was saying due to some poor sound editing. Oppenheimer is fast paced in some scenes but is painfully slow in other scenes. The intimate scenes added nothing of value. This movie is overrated because big casts are in it thats all. Don't get me wrong I'm a huge fan of peaky blinders. This is just name tags attached its not genius and it certainly is not the best thing you will ever see. Once it reaches the big bang everything else in comparison seems bland. Just an average movie at best and its too long. Don't bother wasting your time.
"Christopher Nolan really screwed up here. He joined the scores of other Hollywood movies where you can understand what the actors are saying only half the time. I didn't think it made any sense to switch between black and white and color. I think the sex scenes were gratuitous and unnecessary. They were more of a distraction. Don't get me wrong, I love watching naked women in movies, but this takes away from the storyline of this nonfiction film. I wish there had been some scenes from World War II in Europe. Yes, this movie was about only Oppenheimer, but to add a few scenes from the major events of the world at the time, the setting would've been better. The time period would've been more apparent. This is where the lack of clear dialogue makes the movie a failure. If you're not gonna show some scenes of Europe at war in WWII during this time, period, at least make the actors enunciate and sound clear."
"""Oppenheimer,"" Christopher Nolan's ambitious adaptation of ""American Prometheus,"" disappointingly falls short of expectations set by his previous cinematic marvels. The film is certainly monumental, but its expansive 3-hour length proves testing for the audience's patience. We anticipate a compelling narrative around scientific discovery, atomic theory, and the birth of the atomic bomb. Instead, Nolan swerves into a labyrinth of political intrigue, painting a shadowy picture of Oppenheimer as a communist.The film often feels more like a detached documentary than a stirring cinematic experience. There's no central plot to anchor us, and an unsettling absence of critical historical moments, such as the horrific bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Instead, we wade through a tiresome mire of legal drama, which, while probably accurate, lends little to the cinematic spectacle we seek.Furthermore, the depiction of Oppenheimer is contentious at best. Nolan seems to lionize a figure whose scientific breakthroughs ultimately led to devastating loss of life. This tension between Oppenheimer's humanity and the grim aftermath of his work is a complex issue that the film fails to convincingly navigate.The film left a void where I expected the brilliance of Nolan's past works like ""The Dark Knight Trilogy"" or ""Inception"". After ""Tenet"" and ""Dunkirk,"" this film lands as another unexciting addition to Nolan's recent oeuvre.In conclusion, Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" is a colossal yet uneven historical drama. It stumbles in its storytelling and character portrayal, failing to fully grasp the enormity and gravity of its subject. Though well-intentioned, it ultimately fails to captivate or provoke thought in the way a film of this caliber should."
"A Truman biopic with Gary Oldman playing the lead is what this film really left me wanting to see. Sadly, the Truman scene was maybe 5 minutes long but it was clearly the most honest dialogue in the movie.This movie is not about the Manhattan project. This movie is liberal
hand-wringing over two things: (1) having used the bomb and (2) the hunt to get communists out of sensitive government positions. I get that immediately following the use of the bomb people thought we had opened Pandora's box. But here we are 78 years later and neither we nor anyone else has used one again. And we now know communists were in sensitive positions. Yet the tears continue to flow.Beautifully shot, well acted, but boring. I guarantee you will google ""How long is Oppenheimer"" during the movie. You will also say, ""Hey, why is the music so loud all of the sudden? They are just walking down the street.""This was a bail and switch.PS ... whatever reviewer says this is the greatest war movie ever is high on crack."
"Oppenheimer could have been a great movie. The problem is the script is weak. It's hard to understand and the jumping around in time gets confusing.I kept wondering why the movie was so long and finally figured it out in the final minutes when the whole point of the movie is revealed. Unfortunately, the creators miss the mark in the interpretation of this rather complex man. They were blinded by the political points they wanted to make. Oppenheimer is just another example of Hollywood demagoguery.I would wait for streaming before investing time and money to see this one in the theater. On the other hand, the acting and cinematography are well done."
"After watching Oppenheimer, my initial impression was that the movie felt excessively long and slow-paced. However, from a theatrical standpoint, it is undeniably beautiful. The story revolves around Dr. Oppenheimer being interrogated due to security clearance issues, with flashbacks depicting his journey and contribution to the creation of the atomic bomb, often switching between black and white visuals. The dialogue is intense and weighty, which may appeal to some while potentially dissuading others who prefer more action and a faster pace.One area where Oppenheimer shines is in building anticipation for the main attraction of the movie, the bomb. Regrettably, the bomb-related action amounts to merely about three minutes. There is also the added element of Florence Pugh's presence, providing some eye candy for the audience.Oppenheimer feels like a showcase of cinematic prowess, portraying how exceptionally impactful a film can be. To fully grasp its depth, it may require watching in increments, pausing, and analyzing the intricate details of the story and character actions.In conclusion, while Oppenheimer may not be everyone's cup of tea, I must acknowledge its visual brilliance and rate it a solid seven out of ten."
"This film falls well short of a perfect 10. Undoubtedly, it boasts commendable acting, a decent soundtrack, and an intriguing subject. Yet, regrettably, it devolves into a borefest, burdened by an overtly complicated plot. The story's conclusion seems within reach, but it cunningly extends for another hour, prolonging the viewer's endurance. While the performances shine, the movie's charm wears thin amidst the convoluted narrative. Honest enjoyment gets clouded by an unnecessary length, leaving one longing for a more concise, satisfying experience. In essence, it has potential, but its shortcomings overshadow its strengths."
"It's a good movie, some have called it a 'masterpiece' and 'an important movie in our history'. It's watchable, the filming is beautiful and filmed in the Nolan style that most people love, it's a good story and the amount of famous actors is insane, clearly they fall over themselves these days to be in a Nolan movie. The film is long and although we'll written with some great performances I felt it lacks any real entertainment and tension with the exception of the test scenes, it feels a very political story. For me Nolan has clearly peaked, Batman, inception and interstellar where up there in most peoples top 5 of all time, Dunkirk, Tenet and now this are nowhere near that standard, it's worth a watch but don't expect an IMBD top 25 movie."
"Nolan has promoted the movie around the theme of atomic bomb stressing the significance of watching it only in imax theatres. But in reality besides a 10 minute scene of bomb detonation, there is nothing in the movie to hold your interest. Its literally the biggest scam of a movie. People have paid 3-4X of the price to watch this movie on imax but they all left infuriated at the end. Its 3 hours of people engaging in conversations - literal torture. Dude movies are meant for entertainment not to listen to boring dialogues. I honestly slept in the last 1 hour and i missed nothing. This is not only Nolans weakest film but the most boring film to come out in the last many years.Simple advice - ditch Nolan for Barbie this weekend."
"Oppenheimer is a well made film. The music is amazing. The acting is phenomenal. The story upon which it is based is really interesting as well. The adaptation for the screen, however is blatantly somniferous. Taken into account the upward trend of magnificence in each consecutive Nolan film, this is an absolue low point. It contains the usual tricks: black and white different time lines; flashbacks to a happening undisclosed until the end; ticking tacking music; silence before complete blasting of your eardrums. But now with an A24 vibe... I can't imagine this film has lived up to anybody's expectations."
"The week before I watched a documentary on TV about Oppenheimer so I new about his turbulent and interesting life. Was curious to see how Nolan dramatized it.From the first second on you are met with an fast cut editing style that make you feel you are watching a trailer. There are lots of conversations, which I don't mind, but its cut like they do in Youtube videos. Non-stop, back-to-back. No room for a silent moment, a scenic establish shots or a touching moment.No time to get close to ""Oppie"".After an hour or so I noticed I have never been so aware of sitting in a cinema full of people. Watching the ceiling. Oh, look, someone is getting up to visit the toilet.. Realized this movie is boring me to bits. Gave it another half hour. Then left."
"Watching the trailer and Nolan's previous movies you would believe Oppenheimer is again a great movie with lots of action sequences and tension. However about 80% of the time there is just talking, discussing and investigating. The story is more about Oppenheimer 's life and believes then about building a nuclear bomb.Cillian Murphy shows he can absolutely play a leading roll and is absolutely brilliant. So I would recommend this movie but it's not about action it's more about his life. You can watch it on IMAX but due to missing action sequences you can see it on any screen.Nolan again proves he can make convincing movies with a great story."
"I can't believe these other positive reviews are they for real? I feel like I'm reading the onion. This movie should have been great but it is too long. For context, I'm a fan of history and WWII, but this was difficult to follow. The storyline is convoluted with too many plot lines. It desperately needed to be edited and the movie felt endless after a while. I felt like I was kidnapped in that theater.On the plus side, the visual effects were great as was the use of sound and music. Some of the flashbacks were nice as were the various images of neurons and atoms. The acting was okay, but certainly not good enough to relieve the tedium of this movie.I'm mostly disappointed because of all the hype surrounding this movie and that I bought into it. I guess people are supportive of Hollywood given all the strikes, but the product is just so poor. With all these great TV shows around, Hollywood is just irrelevant. I mean in an age of smartphones and swipes, who thinks a three hour movie is going to work? Then there is the gratuitous nudity (another Hollywood staple) that seemed unnecessary early on in the movie but two hours later when they threw it in again for no reason I understood why.I can believe this has an 8/10 of here. Either they bought bots to write these reviews or they rounded up the staff to write excellent reviews. This movie sucked. Best part was that I got $6 bucks off the ticket."
"The movie is very concentrated you can't miss a minute. At the start, few of the stars and solar pheomenon scenes feel repetitive. The BGM highjacks the scenes though it reduce as the time progresses. Oppenheimer is shown as a perfect man with almost everyone as his friend which is not the case even if you read his Wikipedia page. It doesn't even talk about let alone go in depth about his personal mental hardships, how he became a chain-smokers, etc. Which would have been an amazing plot points. Rami Malek can't blende into the character and his presence is same as any of his previous work except for Bohemian Rhapsody. RDJ is phenomenal actor, no one can tell if he is the same actor who played the Iron Man. Coming back to Wikipedia, even it has more Hindu references to Oppenheimer than this movie. The reference in this movie is intentionally insulting. Even if it is a 3 hour long, it doesn't feel very slow."
"I was so excited for this film. We had to walk out after an hour, which felt like two. Every scene was about 20 seconds, you had no time to digest what was happening or why and who any of the smaller characters were. One minute he's in a classroom the, next he's in the desert on a horse. Parties, classroom, back on a horse. WHY!?! It did seem like the film was slowing down when he was recruited for the Manhattan Project but by that point I'd lost all faith in the film. Maybe when it finally hits Netflix or something I'll start it again from where I left but that was one of the worst hours of cinema I've ever witnessed. Even the dialogue felt rushed like they knew it was pointless so they just wanted to get through it. How about just not including it?"
"Good Film but I did find it slow in places, seems to build and build to a slight anticlimax.Yes it's very good but I still feel it was missing a couple of ingredients in my view.I did not find it as none stop thrilling film as it could have been but don't get me wrong it's an excellent film and loved the Albert Einstein story. Maybe a bit more WW2 action/context would have made it fly a little more.Excellent acting by the main stars and amazing cast just falls shorts a little, maybe it was built up to much.Some films can be 3 hours but don't feel like it's been 3 hours but sadly this did feel like 3 hours to me."
"This Movie is overrated. Yes, the Cast is Top notch. Yes, the Score and the visuals are good.But the rest? This is basically House of Cards, the Movie. And i mean the bad, boring aspects of it, the political intricacies. I went to see the Movie for the technical aspects, the making of the Bomb. The Morale implications, which has so many parallels to todays AI dilemma: If we don't develop it, potential Bad actors will, and they will use it against us. Instead of focussing on that, we get to see a political trial that obviously is rigged- We all know it, the chatacters know it, yet we spend 2/3 the time of the Moving on it. This is insanely boring, as we know the outcome early on.Imagine this movie made 2 Years in the Future: This could have been part Biopic, part Statement around the current AI dilemma: If we don't continue development, bad actors will. If the A Bomb was the defining development of last century, AI is the one of the current one. What a perfect metaphor this one could have been, had it been done a bit later. That's what bums me the most about it.Like it stands however: In the end, movies should Entertain. Ideally, while educating us a bit. This movie does educate- but it fails to Entertain."
"The acting in this movie is insane. Absolutely incredible. Everyone. The plot and the dialogue is too much. It's all over the place. I frequently had to ask my friend what somebody said. I found myself zoning out when they would talk. I felt like I had 3 hours of elevated heart rate. It's a good movie with a lot of impact, but it felt a little lost to me. I also wish it put a heavier emphasis on the impact of what the bomb actually did in total vs. What it did to the men involved, however, I understand that was not the main purpose of the plot. I'm not a history or physics buff, so I had a hard time digesting this movie. Overall, it did bring a lot of awareness to what has happened and the people involved. Grateful for that, but I am not recommending this for everybody."
"Like anything Nolan has everdone, it is overly long, pretentious and overrated by his rabid fanbase. A real snooze fest.The subject matter is so compelling . I was expecting an explosion, but instead what i got was a dudI thought this movie would be 'da bomb ' but it failed to ignite any interestBad puns aside, the acting was good but the plot and narrative were sub par. . I've seen people throwing around the idea that this is a masterpiece but i felt it was seriously lacking. In terms of commentary on nucelar annhilation I'll stick to
kubrick's Dr strange love. Nolan is the poor man's Kubrick."
"Huge Nolan fan but felt a bit letdown on this adaptation of storytelling. As expected the edit had you moving to different times frames of the story, but to a fault. Sometimes less is more. It felt too disjointed in the story telling for me. It wasn't taxing to follow along and know where you were at in the overall story arch for most of the movie but it was enough that it really distracted from the story itself. I'd be curious to see the post production edit process and understand the thought process that goes into Nolan's specific style of story telling. The score at times is distracting and takes away from the movie. Less is more. Let the weight of the acting and dialogue along with camera angles and edit push the tension needed. Pumping louder and louder violin and other music and sound does build tension but to me felt overdone and unnatural. It really distracted and took away from the acting which is a shame. The lensing of the film is pure magic and I soaked it all in at a showing in 70mm film. It felt the full 3 hours and had me checking my watch to see how much time was left. I've seen other 3 hour movies and felt disappointed in reaching the end to quickly. It will win awards and I give big kudos on the filming, tackling this story and the acting. I think the film could have used some lighter moments in both expressing joy and humor to balance and tug the audiences around. The nudity scenes didn't add to the story and the one was a bit uncomfortable which is what he was going for in the scene. I most likely won't be rewatching the film but am interested in leaning a bit more about the story."
"Where do I even begin with ''Oppenheimer''? This film was an absolute disaster from start to finish. I can't believe I wasted precious hours of my life on such a pretentious and uninspiring piece of cinema.First and foremost, the pacing of the movie was horrendous. It felt like the director was trying to bore the audience to death with excruciatingly slow scenes that seemed to go on forever. I found myself checking my watch every few minutes, praying for this never-ending ordeal to be over.The characters in ''Oppenheimer'' were as lifeless as cardboard cutouts. Despite the incredible historical significance of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life and the Manhattan Project, the filmmakers managed to suck all the excitement and intrigue out of the story. The protagonist's emotions were about as captivating as watching paint dry, and the supporting characters were so one-dimensional that I couldn't muster any empathy for them.Let's not forget the cringe-worthy attempts at romance that seemed shoehorned into the story without any real purpose. The love interest was so poorly developed that it felt like the actors were reading lines from a cheesy romance novel. It was painful to witness such forced interactions that added nothing to the overall narrative.Furthermore, the soundtrack was utterly forgettable, failing to enhance the emotional impact of pivotal moments in the film. A compelling score could have salvaged some of the lifelessness in the story, but alas, ''Oppenheimer'' didn't deliver on that front either.In conclusion, ''Oppenheimer'' is a colossal disappointment that squandered a fascinating historical subject with its meandering plot, lifeless characters, and overall lack of direction. Save yourself the agony and skip this snoozefest; Watch Barbie instead."
"An informative and dramatic biopic on the father of the atomic bomb, but it's not as stylish or atmospheric as Nolan's other films.- - - -- - - - - -It's an engaging and interesting story covering powerful topics with some tension in the first half as they race to create the bomb followed by a 'legal drama' aftermath in the second. Superb acting performances from the varied cast and the science was demonstrated and explained well, but the sex scenes felt out of place and the visuals, although impressive, were too few and far between.Overall, i would score Oppenheimer as a seven out of ten."
"Awful. Nolan is LOST. 2 hours and 40 minutes of meaningless dialogue, abrupt cutaways, nameless, empty characters and 20 minutes of real movie making/story telling. Robert Oppenheimer is an interesting, impactful figure in history, but clearly not worthy of a movie about his life if this is what we get. I cannot believe a master like Nolan can take such a juicy subject and turn it into the most tedious endurance tests one will ever face in a movie theatre. If you're interested in the Manhattan project you'll get a glimpse of it. If you're interested in seeing a two and a half hour interrogation into whether or not Robert Oppenheimer had communist ties whooo boy are you in for a treat. Cillian Murphy was fine. Nolan needs to find himself ASAP."
"""Oppenheimer,"" directed by Christopher Nolan, offers a visually stunning biopic of the renowned physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. However, beneath the surface of this historical drama, it becomes evident that Nolan's true fascination lies in exploring his own psyche through the avatar of Oppenheimer. The film delves into the physicist's inner torments, mirroring Nolan's obsession with apocalyptic scenarios seen in his previous works like ""Interstellar"" and ""Tenet.""From the outset, Nolan appears to use Oppenheimer's story as a canvas upon which he projects his own obsessions and anxieties. The physicist's involvement in the creation of the atomic bomb, paralleled with Nolan's tendency to create cataclysmic, world-altering scenarios in his films, reinforces the notion that Oppenheimer serves as a vehicle for Nolan's introspection.Throughout ""Oppenheimer,"" the last hour takes a peculiar turn as it goes to great lengths to depict the inner struggles of a narcissist. This portrayal can be attributed to the fact that both Nolan and Oppenheimer have narcissistic tendencies. This similarity may be the key to understanding Nolan's fixation on Oppenheimer's psyche and his ongoing trial. As described by a psychologist, 'the life of a narcissist becomes an everlasting trial, akin to a Kafkaesque ""process"" where the punishment is the constant judgment and scrutiny of the self'. This portrayal could be a manifestation of Nolan's own self-awareness and the introspective torment that he experiences as a filmmaker and artist.By positioning Oppenheimer as his avatar, Nolan seemingly subjects himself to the same judgment that the physicist faced from the community he helped furnish. This creative choice adds an intriguing meta-layer to the film, where the audience witnesses Nolan's exploration of his own artistic and personal consequences.However, this self-indulgence comes at a cost. Nolan's apparent obsession with self-introspection might alienate parts of the movie-going public. Just as Oppenheimer faced criticism and backlash from the very community he contributed to, Nolan may find himself under scrutiny for his tendency to prioritize his own emotional explorations over a more straightforward, historically accurate biopic.Despite the film's enthralling visual spectacle and the captivating performance by its cast, ""Oppenheimer"" ultimately reveals more about Nolan's psyche than about the historical figure it claims to depict. Nolan's fascination with apocalyptic themes and his narcissism seem to overshadow the physicist's story, turning the biopic into a vehicle for self-expression rather than a faithful representation of history."
"I want to say I am a massive Nolan fan and there is still a seedling of hope within me that we will get the chance to watch another masterpiece before I pass off the earth, however, I think those days are sadly gone.Oppenheimer was amazingly shot, structured well with obviously amazing acting but there was just one thing lacking - entertainment. I'm really not sure you would find this movie interesting. Maybe Oppenheimer purists, maybe physicists, maybe people who like to watch legal proceeding and just hours of dialogue. I hate to say this but the movie was just so boring. I was falling sleep and just ready to go home by the first hour, definitely by the second hour and by the third hour, I was merely a shell of my former self.What happened to the days of Inception, The Dark Knight, Interstellar. A fictional world where characters were developed who we grow to love, even in the short span of a few hours. I know this movie is more to go over Oppenheimer's life but frankly, I didn't care. This movie did not have to be made.I still sit with hope that there will be a masterpiece somewhere into the future to save us from this growingly bleak world. And you, Nolan, have the power to do it."
A lot big rereleases this summer. This being one of the huge duw to its critics following. Directed by one of Hollywood's high class directors Mr. Christopher Nolan. Firstly the biography of the scientist is very well portrayed with factual history. In my opinion there could have been more entertainment factors added to engage the audience more. The movie is 3 hours long in length which does make it seem VERY slow. Half the audience were asleep. The beauty of Nolan is he doesn't make it seem that there are any unnecessary scenes in the movie it feels required. The acting performances are excellent. Main lead by Cillian murphy he has also appeared in Mr. Nolans previous hits in smaller roles but now I feel he got the deserving role. His body language and expressions as oppeheimer are fantastic: Living the character. Following other big names too like R. D. J with a good performance too as an antagonist. Now the best part about the movie is the sparkling cinematography which lead the audience eyes shining. I watched this in Imax 70 MM on the best screen possible so I cant talk about the regular but Im sure it still shows. Its worth taking 70 MM from what I saw. The other good thing was the sound design also exceptional. Makes you feel your in the movie. Everytime there is a bomb the audience gets a jumps care. The whole audience in my theatre didint say a word for the whole movie even though it was a full house no seats available (even though it was a weekday). Overall a Slow but sparkling watch for the fans!
"Hold onto your seats, movie enthusiasts, because ""Oppenheimer's Insensitive Portrayal"" takes you on a bewildering journey through historical misrepresentation and sensationalism. This film attempts to merge the scientific legacy of J. Robert Oppenheimer with the timeless wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita, but ends up veering into tasteless territory.The premise seems intriguing: delving into Oppenheimer's struggles during the atomic bomb's development while drawing parallels with the Bhagavad Gita's teachings. However, the execution falls flat.From the start, it's clear that shock value overshadows genuine storytelling. The Bhagavad Gita, a revered philosophical text, is carelessly reduced to a plot device involving explicit content. Rather than honoring its depth, the film offensively equates its teachings with intimate scenes.Cultural sensitivity should have been vital. Yet, the film dismisses the Gita's sanctity for controversy's sake. It raises questions about the filmmakers' intent: genuine exploration or deliberate provocation?This movie sparks reflection, but not as intended. Instead of bridging science, spirituality, and ethics, it leaves us pondering media's state, prioritizing shock over respect.""Oppenheimer's Insensitive Portrayal"" is a cautionary tale on approaching these themes. Let's hope future filmmakers honor history, science, and spirituality with respect, rather than choosing tasteless offense."
"1) Nolan's Oppenheimer (2023) is a historically accurate film.2) But sadly, the movie feels like Made-for-TV drama! Interesting but not engaging enough!3) The focus should have been on making of the bomb! But, what we see is Oppenheimer's communist past, his messy love life, his trial and his tussles with Lewis Strauss etc.4) There is almost no science in the movie, just politics! Names of scientists are thrown randomly: Einstein, Bohr, Feynman, Fermi, Heisenberg etc. - but with no real character development & arcs. So the film feels hollow and pretentious.5) This movie is crammed with too much story! Every scene feels rushed. Every scene is loaded with dialogues. You move on to the next scene and its even more dialogue. Nolan is guilty of not letting any scene breathe by itself, and he does not allow the audience to absorb and process the scenes! It feels like a marathon of scenes trying to reach the finish line! So in the end, even a 3-hour run time is simply not good enough!6) The entire IMAX thing was a gimmick. The cinematography was nothing special. That's completely fine given the kind of movie it is. You can't really have any breath-taking shots when shooting a realistic biopic set in small to medium sized rooms (classrooms, labs, living rooms, offices, senate...). The only scenes with potential were the shots in the desert. But the filmmakers made a conscious decision to opt for realism. It's just that they hyped-up the IMAX experience so much that it felt truly disappointing.7) Nolan's film is neither a feature film nor a documentary, and is abjectly floundering in-between! A feature film even when re-telling history, must evoke emotions - one reason why filmmakers like: Spielberg (Saving Private Ryan, Lincoln, Schindler's List, The Terminal, Catch me if You Can, Bridge of Spies, The Fabelmans); Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind, Cinderella Man); Brian de Palma (Scarface); Asif Kapadia (Senna, Amy) are a class apart!(Anurag Kashyap's Black Friday (2007) is a brilliant docustyled feature and an unique anamololy.)"
"2.5 hours of torture. Enjoyed only 30 minutes of science discussion. Whole movie was based on countries ideological battle. US thinks communism is bad for everyone and it will destroy humanity. US centric approach is always right, that's what they think. Whole movie is based on useless group discussions multiple times. Very well promoted. Boring and pathetic dialogues. I was feeling sleepy after 1 hour. Don't know why they wasted 3 hours on a topic which could be covered in a 15-30 minutes of short description. I feel Christopher Nolan wasted money and resources on such short topic which we can read within 15 minutes."
"Good watch if you have patience, scientific temper and desire to see a dramatized version of Oppenheimer's personal story.This is not a background movie, you'll need to actually watch the movie.It is not for everyone, if you want quick-action-satisfaction, this is not for you. The a-bomb explosion is not the main part of the story.The main story is about how Oppenheimer was involved in the twisted world of politics for speaking his mind. It is HIS story, not of the war or the project.For what the story is trying to show, it's very well done.I have rated it seven stars because while it was good, I do not think it was thought inducing or a movie that'll end up to become a classic, at least not in my books."
"The movie was three hours long...and it seemed longer. I was looking forward to seeing an adult movie, but spend three hours watching a grey movie with ugly cinematography and didn't even notice the much talked about black and white photography, because it didn't contrast with the bland grey of the rest of the film. There was a big deal about it being filmed in IMAX, but it remind3d me of watching 8mm home movies, of a family you don't know, or really care to get to know.The lead actor was the old man from Poltergeist, and he even wore the same hat! Most of the cast was non-descript and interchangeable,, which only made the show harder to follow because they all looked alike and the bland photography and lack of color and similar outfits didn't help. The actors didn't really seem to help, as Robert Downey Jr. And Casey Affleck (whose only connection to acting is being Ben's brother) served mostly as wallpaper... there presence wasn't really needed as the movie was intensively dialogue driven ( as in, they could have just done an audiobook and I probably wouldn't have noticed).The movie was not as long as it was LOUD. Lots of booming noises, and yet, some of the dialogue was muffled and hard to understand. And there was a LOT of dialogue. It seemed as though this was intentional as the movie was more like a documentary than a drama where you are engaged by the actors and become involved in the story. It seemed as though the dialogue could have been more engrossing if they had just read a Statistics textbook out loud. It was very clinical, after three hours, you were told a lot about the characters, but as there was no chemistry or emotional involvement between them, you never feel it. In fact, they portrayed Oppenheimer as cold, and then tried to tell you he was a womanizer. It just didn't work...he did not come off as charismatic, yet he had numerous love interests. Physically, he looked like he hadn't quite survived a hunger strike and had the body of a 10 year old...not something anybody would be attracted to or want to look at, way too much for a whole documentary. Not that I cared to be subjected to his female love interests, as they were filmed in a way to delete any possibility of physical attraction. Christopher Nolan has received a lot of criticism for purposely not having sex scenes in his movies. It turns out he knows his weaknesses and set out to prove it with these unattractive scenes.As far as documentaries go, I'll wait for Ken Burns to make one that is involving and interesting."
"Positives:
Cillian Murphy is amazing, Robert Downey Jr really shows up, The B&W photography is beautifulWeaknesses:
The analog Nolanisms are a distraction (Fincher contended with period-isms better in Manhunter using digital processes and CGI), Audio mix is muddled and hard on the dialogue, 70MM film stock is over-sold for a movie that largely takes plan indoors, the non-linear timeline gets a bit confusingBiggest problem:
Nolan's work in this film is extremely derivative, 1st 1/3rd directly quotes T Malick and A Beautiful Mind, Last 1/3rd (the interrogations) is very Lumet, The internal conflict noisey white-out bits is very Villeneuve (but, done badly), The first kissing scene in the desert is poorly and distractingly blockedGreat story, amazing performances, but a strike against Nolan as an auteur. All the previously referenced directors, even the ones working recently, developed a coherently new thing for audiences. Nolan really fails that attempt in this movie. While sitting in the movie theater, I pretty quickly wished someone else had made this movieWorth seeing for the acting and the story, not as an accomplishment in film-making or directing."
"The movie is boring, too long, pompous... There were some monets where I was genuinely interested. However the overall imoression is a big dissapointment. They must have spent a lot on marketing to get so many people into cinema. I cant belive all the reviews praising this move as some kind of mastery. Seriously? Please take some reality check. It didnt even pass Bachdel test, we have 2023. There were also women working on the bomb. Oppenheimers wife almost isnt portrayed. Solely old male perspective. I would watch this movie on a Sunday, after lunch, layong on my couch and napping from time to time... Please do your own thinking, use your brain to formulate your own opinion. Uou find it boring but still give it 9 or 10 stars. Why? Because the mainstream tell you its a great masterpiece."
"If you know Chris Nolan movies, you will know the usual tropes
Non- linear story tellingGreat background score but loud at times making dialogue non-comprehensible-Studded star castSo what else is there to write a review about? Two words- Cillian Murphy. Murphy was so convincing I forgot he was an actor playing Oppenheimer. If this movie does not land an Oscar for Murphy, it will surely be a lost opportunity. Also notable are the supporting performances by Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon and Emily Blunt.The biggest criticism I have on this movie, is that Nolan goes overboard with the non-linear story telling with too many time jumps making a relatively simple timeline too complex for an average audience to follow.Furthermore, it is important for anyone keen to watch this movie to know what the movie is about- it is a movie about the life of Oppenheimer, not about the bomb..Infact, Nolan shows very little of the Trinity bomb and the dropping the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki...using a rather muted way to show the latter.. perhaps to respect the sensitivities of the incident. The story follows the tribulations and trials of Oppenheimer before and after the bomb so there are many panel discussion and committee hearing scenes that may bore some who are not interested in history. All in all it's an important story to be told and Nolan manages to tell it in the way only Nolan can."
"A self-important movie, you'd be a social outcast if you diss it. But it deserves dissing. What is with filmmakers these days that they forget we need people to root for in a movie, even one based on the winners' version of history. Technical filmmaking is okay but people need people to connect to a piece of film.Cillian Murphy is an excellent actor but is wasted in this dreary, droning 3-hour indulgence. Save for maybe the fat Jewish friend who's always feeding Oppie, the rest of the cast may look like historical folks but there's ZERO character development here. Emily Blunt has one note - a scowl on her face for most parts. RDJ was probably roped in to lend his name in return for a sure Oscar nomination.This is not Nolan territory.I'd like to think he had his arm-twisted by the Jewish lobby to make this...have to bag the generational director for the cause. Good for him coz the same lobby will do everything to declare this movie a success and an important film in his canon.It isn't.When Titanic was released, it was accompanied by documentaries of the sunken ship as well. Docus for pondering, the movie for pleasure.Oppenheimer docus would probably serve us well. The movie not so much. So choose to spend your 3 hours wisely."
"First, you don't have to watch it in imax. So, you can save lots of money. About the movie...Actors are good. Cinematography is good. However, the story is very hard to follow. You need prior knowledge about the politics of post second world war. Otherwise, you'll find yourself asking other who is this, why is he doing this, what does he refer to, etc. I enjoyed watching scientists struggling to make the right decision and materializing the consequences of their actions, but that is it. To summarize, a very overhyped movie. I believe someone will make a movie about oppenheimer in the future because this couldn't deliver."
"""Tell don't show"" boring . Required better writing, removing the entire story-line of security clearance.It watched as a pastiche montage of different timelines and some interesting visualisations of quantum physics.White male focused is an understatement. Male secondary characters had more nuance and depth than leading female characters. Does Chris just miss the days of male-dominant days when he was young?I walked out halfway through the film. Couldn't bear the fast choppy, no breathing space dialogue chain of characters just spelling everything out. Thanks goodness I did not commit to IMAX ticket, would not watch it again even on a small screen."
"Superb acting by an incredible cast and great cinematography!BUT.I liked Oppenheimer less than all of Nolan's other movies (maybe more than Tenet, although the latter had some amazing action sequences).It requires a lot of attention for the whole movie (which 3 hours personally is a bit tedious). The movie is all dialogue with at least 3 timelines concurrently being depicted, quickly switching between them.Not sure what the hype for watching it in IMAX was for, (which is what I watched it in) as there are barely any scenes that take advantage of the immersive format.The soundtrack is great but not memorable. I guess there's a limit to how much you can do when directing a biopic.Fine for a one-time watch, I don't think I would ever dedicate 3 hours to Oppenheimer again."
"This was a birthday present from my wife, i can't believe i sat through this rubbish. WHY...1. The music was so over powering it didn't fit in with the film. 2. Extremely slow going, lots of talking. 3. Flicks from one scene to another couldn't make heads or tails of it. 4. Didn't like the sex scenes, didn't need it. 5. The film was way way too long. 6. Some of the acting was SO wooden, my nan could've done better, and she's been dead for 20 years. 6. The story could've been told in a much better way..maybe make it abit more entertaining understanding enjoyable....what we need is Steven Spielberg back."
"Firstly, fantastic acting by Cillian and Downey. Amazing cameo by Gary Oldman. Rest of the cast were good nothing extraordinary. But my personal problem was the story makes a lot of jump cuts which is fine, but before going in the movie audience is expected to do a little bit of homework. Two hearings were going on in the beginning and only much later we are explained what's going on, but by that time I got exhausted just keeping up. Also once the explanation is given I didn't care enough. I usually don't check time or speak with anyone during the movie but it was very hard not to. I liked Downey's acting better than Cillian btw."
"I went to see this movie because I'm Irish and think Cillian Murphy is amazing. I had no idea what the movie was about but wanted to support an Irish actor. I was really impressed by his unfailing acting ability (which has been flawless since the beginning of his public Career), Emily blunt also was brilliant and the other actors - but the writing and script structure was woeful.The whole movie was written from the pov of audience preknowledge bias, so for someone like me who has never heard of Oppenihemer or have any idea about physics or atomic energy, it felt like I entered into a story half way through. In media, you always start with the 'reset button' and make the assumption that the audience knows nothing and you bring them on a journey. A majority of people will not know about these things and so get lost trying to figure it out. There were actually people in the cinema googling things because it wasn't clear and we had no idea what they were talking about.Also, the length of the movie was madness... The story wasn't gripping enough to keep your focus for three hours. By 2hrs in people were checking their watches/phones to see what time it was. I think the sub plots and courtroom scenes with Robert Downey Jr (fab acting), could have been totally removed and if the focus had have been on one character and the story of creating the bomb and the moral dilemma he had, it would have been so much more engaging. The side story could have been explained in a few paragraphs at the end and saved us an hour of what felt like pointless b roll and a distraction from the real story which shaped humanity, not some petty narcissistic vengeance plot....Long movies such as Lord of the Rings keep you gripped the entire time because the storyline and plot is clear And engaging - this was so boring and disappointing script writing.The acting was fantastic, genuinely brilliant, but if they cut an hour out and stuck to Oppenihemer genius and the dilemma of living with what his intellect produced, it would have been Oscar worthy."
"I enjoyed Oppenheimer, it's a very well made and well acted movie. I though Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt were fantastic, Robert Downey Jr was good support.Not gonna lie though, the film suffered from the same thing all biographies do - they only ever shine a light on a small portion of the subjects life, I came out knowing only slightly more about Oppenheimer than when I went in.Also the film is 20 minutes too long, the sex scenes were unnecessary, some of the communist stuff became a slog and the bomb moment was kinda underwhelming.But I've recommended it to my friends and that's all a filmmaker can ask for I guess."
"I just saw this late this afternoon in Astoria Queens, NY. Here are some observations:1) It goes into incredible detail about Oppenheimer's leadership and engagement with the group creating the atomic bomb, his troubled relationship with a woman named Jackie, and then after it was discovered that a Russian spy had infiltrated the project, the subsequent way in which he was mistreated as a communist sympathizer, which he wasn't.2) The acting by both Celian Murphy and Emily Blunt (not to mention others) was top notch.3) The film had way too much dialogue, especially of cerebral and technical natures, for the average moviegoer to follow. This slowed the pace down quite a bit, making the first hour, in particular, interminable! There could have been much less of it and put across in layman's terms.4) The soundtrack seemed to overpower what was going on on the screen at times.5) I believe the entire story could have been paired down and told in two hours, making it a more enjoyable experience for the audience.6) And the whole film seemed overly slick, almost as if the way it was made was meant to overshadow the story."
"I can see why many would like this movie very much. I myself enjoyed it most of the time. The acting was stunning. However, if you know the history of the atomic bomb creation, there is not much to see. I was not impressed by Oppenheimer as a character. He is the genius white male who wants to save the world by creating the atomic bomb and then cant stand the burden of his own creation. He is turned into a martyr by political circumstances so he gets to be remembered as the genius scientist, yet he keeps none of the responsability of his creation. I would rather the character would have kept his villain side, as I find it hard to absolve him of the whole responsability of his creation."
"In 25+ years of seeing movies at the movie theater have I left a movie early. The only good thing about this movie, was the acting and the wardrobe. The screenplay sucked. Made it about sex. Romanticized science. I couldn't even make it to the actual explosion. This film was pure propaganda at its finest. What a waste of money. If you do happen to go see this movie just be prepared to be underwhelmed. I saw the movie last night in imax. Why this was in imax I don't understand. The glasses did nothing. Hollywood is officially DEAD. Flaming pile of garbage. From Nolan too!?!?!? Would not recommend."
"Sadly it didn't meet.The cast is tremendous. Each single one of them has a history of being top notch. The sound, sudden cinematography switch between black & white vs colour gives a good Old school effect of Objective/ Subjective attitude. As a biography it tells a Story in an Unique & unforgettable sort of way. The first harf of it was absolutely joyous
With excellent acting & excitement above the roofBut
Christopher Nolan has made the second half of this movie for a widely sophisticated audience. Mostly for the Men & Women who have debate as their weapons . Politics & politicians. Brawl in a courtroom accusing a scientist, just like the president said
*Do you think the average Public of Japan cares who built the bomb? I dropped it . Neither does the public viewers care about the politician. The reader reading my review doesn't know which country i belong to , what age i belong in.If you want me to write the truth ,
It didn't show the actual horror of the aftermath. The kick in the stadium when everyone was praising Oppenheimer Showed some glimpses of actual horror. I got Excited ! Him stepping one a burnt vase shaped of a girl , a man vomiting
But the spark didn't continue. Sheer heartbreak . It sort of turned into a court room fiasco with words repeatedly asked sometimes just to grab the viewers throat
& Ask it again. People know the horrors yes , but do they consider people who wasted , their respective family, life , reason to live , who actually witnessed numerous tests afterwards ww2.It s critical, its vital to show a cinema in biography
But why holding the actual truth hidden in plain sight, let everyone above eighteen watch the horror . Their forefathers witnessed it in front of their eyes. So why not?There was never shown any good effect of fission now being used for a lot of power consumption in the entire world. Factories delivering power uninterrupted. All thanks to Oppenheimer , his team & Scientist Leo szilard.Why not including these & many others , there are . There must be .As a biography it's very strict to its principle but that just makes it a dreary movie with a lot of beautiful background Score .Biographies like Lawrence of Arabia to A beautiful Mind all go through unexpected side journey of a protagonist. There are down & Ups . This movie Mr Nolan announced will touch audience within their heart , will leave you weeping
But
This literally ended with a fake courtroom scene like a unfinished candle snatched away from your hand while you were in a dark room , trying to enlight.Inventing IMAX cameras for black & white, the classic Noir looks good but it didn't touch every part of history, it gives few to no hint,
Everything is there . It didn't show the Japanese or even the World side
It only focuses on America.The aftermath is the present.With Threat is still looming
But Among the audience,
The sheer ignorance . Why the director didn't do justice to a biography? The justice who was president J. F. kennedy wasn't even included , not even a single shot ?People
He put a stop on US , testing any Atomic Bomb. (including Army recruits who were less than 18) , now severely damaged or dead due to radiation injury. Cold war was very active whch saw a worldwide spike of Nuclear testing. The competition stopped between Giant power with U. S. S. R. now turn into Russia . There are statistics not shown to anyone, files , archives
Do they show ads of it to public who stay busy in their respective minds?Why none of them were shown?I have seen biographiesI was expecting A little bit satisfaction that the world, gathered would & should now is going to know the difference in abuse of absolute power . The younger generation like really, they should be able to comprehend the issue & its impact because
That is "" what matters "" but
My review is not going to be read by mere 20 And This cinema had one of the best chance of convincing a sheer public
About everything related to atoms and Dr J. R. Oppenheimer. The scenario now , the scenario they had to put up with at the end of their livesBut
It missed it all.Ahh director, my director , i wish everyone going to movies have a rich sense in history but the guy besides me asked wasn't Japan in ww1 ?"
"Well made film. In all manners just fantastic. Nolan is exceptional. When Hollywood is taking itself out with politics instead of entertainment, Nolan saved the day and brought us a spectacle. As good as I hoped it would be. Fairly accurate story telling but very much biased. Here's how.Oppenheimer was a nationalist and a warpig. Making the bomb was completely unnecessary after Nazi Germany surrendered. "" We made a destructive gadget to counter evil nahtzees "" pretext doesn't apply anymore, nevertheless he still kept on working on the project. US's nuclear attack didn't make Japan surrender but Soviet's marching to Manchuria and then some gave the vapors to Japan's emperor. Whether he regrets his work or not, it doesn't matter. Oppenheimer is responsible for handing a genocidal weapon to the psychopathic US politicians all in hopes of either attaining fame or satiating his country's jingoist cravings. Oppenheimer through "" international control"" wanted the Soviets to not develop their own bomb and the Imperialist US to retain it's monopoly. Would've liked him more if he was an agent to the Soviet union. Rip Klaus Fuchs, the man who worked to ensure atomic weapons would not be the sole possession of one country. They should make a movie on such a brave and rational man. He sure was more logical than sorry a*$ Oppenheimer.I still don't get how Oppenheimer getting his security clearance revoked is more important than his work which wiped off 150,000 lives ,and got more coverage in the movie.Great flick when it comes to it's technical and performance aspects. Contrariwise, it's story could have done some tweaks here and there."
"The bomb scene was so overhyped it killed the rest of the movie for me.Now I think of Nolan as a pretentious guy. Dude didn't want to use CGI and instead used whatever he used to make a real bomb. Such a dud. The impact of the movie was severely deflated by that weak showing of a atom bomb. I was so looking forward to feel the extreme feelings of seeing that bomb that the the movie was leading up to and it was so bad. Really so bad. Mushroom cloud, no ring, no devastation. The light wasn't that bright. Insane that a movie can be so hyped up over one scene and the scene was absolute crap.Shame on Christopher Nolan. CGI would have been better."
"I really wanted to love this movie because I am a history buff and I wanted to see the story behind the bomb, and in a way I did get the story behind the bomb, but in a very confusing and boring way. The movie kept jumping around between time periods before the war and after the war, showing all kinds of scenes out of sequence, which if done right can be very effective, but in this movie it was done wrong, very wrong. A simple ""1939"" on the screen would've made things clear, but I guess we're just supposed to know. Even at the end of this three hour long marathon I was still confused about many of the scenes, and it wasn't just about the time periods, but the dialogue itself was confusing. Half the time I didn't know what or who they were talking about, and the last hour, after the bomb exploded, was not only boring and confusing, but also entirely pointless and the movie would've been better without it. In addition, they added in these scenes, presumably for dramatic effect, that were intended to show the character's emotions or thought process at the time, showing us what he was feeling but was not actually happening, and that too missed the mark for me. Much of it was just awkward and annoying. It wasn't all bad. The acting was very good, and some of the scenes were very powerful, but overall I'm still very disappointed in this movie. It could've been so much more entertaining."
So I have watched this movie the opening is so great they started movie with awesome sound effects i really great ful to watch such movie but they really disappointed me on the Gita scene 😢 Even this book is one of the pure book in world I don't like this scene they derespect the book. But in other way this movie is great and this movie is for mature audiences and viewers in other you need to put your full attention of that movie this bomb sence was so realistic and beautiful the acting is also good and the character are so fit to all of them and enisten role is so perfect that last scene give you gossemebs.
"I don't dislike many films but this one was awful. The score was completely overwhelming and constant, to the point where you couldn't hear most of the dialogue. There were two trials where the only thing at stake was seemingly a loss of reputation. There was hours and hours of talking and the constant introduction of white male characters who all looked the same. I felt as if I'd been in a ten hour long lecture when I left the cinema. The only good part was when they did the bomb test in the middle of the film. The two halves before and after that are dreary, pretentious and overwhelming for your ears."
"Overall, a very good watch. Sadly, I was unable to see this one in cinemas, because I didn't realise I would need ID. Apparantly I don't look a day over 15, thanks I guess?? Personally, the film is a little too long, with the most notable part of the film happening over the half-way mark. And the relationship between Robert (Murphy) and Jean (Pugh) confused me a little, don't know why because it was pretty self-explanatory. It's just the way that she decides to end her life because he said they couldn't see eachother anymore... After all the times that she gave hints that she was only in it for the 'fun'...Hmmm. What I do like about the film, and I mean I REALLY like it, was the lead-up to the testing of the bomb. The tension that was created just in the scenes of the creation and when they were hoisting it up. Plus, the weather. The weather should have been paid for it's job because WOW. But, when the testing scene came, I literally stopped breathing. I don't know how to describe how beautifully made that scene was. Nolan is in my good books for this film."
"Oppenheimer felt like a VERY long trailer because of very short scenes and a constant blaring soundtrack. A insane amount of details and names were thrown at you, while almost every single scene has a score playing. It only got interesting about 2/3rds into the film, but by then it was too late to save the overall experience - at least for me.The actors did well and I suppose it was beautifully filmed, but in my opinion in does not match the previous efforts of Nolan - not by a long stretch. A few scenes late in the film were amazing, but I will not be rewatching this in the future - unless they find a way to edit it intensely."
"This movie is not all boring, it has some amazing moments. But it does not feel like a movie rather than a over explanatory trailer about a great movie. It constantly feels like it's moving either to fast or to slow. Sometimes you feel like you are just being force feed information at a rate that no human ever would find pleasing. Other times you almost fall asleep beacuse of the low tempo. The movie also focuses more on the political side of the manhattan project rather than oppenheimer himself. Therefore when any emotional scenes with oppenheimer and his close ones would appear you would just feel like the third wheel of a relationship that you barely knew existed. I personally feel this is the problem with alot Cristhofer Nolan's movies. I do love some of his work, but constantly i feel like i never really knew the characters that well. With Memento as a exception. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer did well enough. In the start of the movie he was very interesting and displayed alot of emotions through his acting. By the half and the end it more felt like i was watching some sigma male tiktok compilation. This really made the movie alot harder to watch than it should have been. The only emotions displayed by Cillian at the end was intensly staring in to the distance, so the marketing team was perhaps not lying. This was made even more clear when seeing Gary Oldman as Truman. In my opinion he outpreformed every single one with his scene. His face shifted so slightly with each new emotion and really had you at the edge of your seat. Cillian's intensive stare quickly became exposed of its shortcomings by this preformance. I could go into the visual side of this movie but we all know they are the best as always with Cristhofer Nolan so im not gonna waste your time with that. I am going to say that Ludwig Göransson made an absolute banger with the score to this movie and it truly made the whole experience alot better."
"Oppenheimer"" stays true to the life of the renowned physicist, but unfortunately, it falls short in delivering an engaging cinematic experience. The movie is incredibly fast paced in terms of the information it throws at you, and it never slows down. If you tune out for more than a minute, you'll be lost for the rest of the movie.The music and lighting, though dramatic, overshadows the scenes themselves, at times taking away from the movie's intended impact. Even more disappointing is the anticlimactic portrayal of the atomic bomb explosion, considering the two-hour build-up leading to it. I couldn't help but expect a more gripping and realistic portrayal of such a momentous event.Ultimately, ""Oppenheimer"" ended up being more of a political drama than a compelling exploration of the life and scientific contributions of J. Robert Oppenheimer. While it accurately depicts his journey, it left me longing for a more captivating movie experience."
"This movie is the perfect example of the Emperor's New Clothes tale made movie... Aside from perfect acting and good editing it lacks the most important thing in art, heart!, it tries so hard to be genius just like the character it's based on, but just like him it does not have any wisdom and more important, it does not prove to be an entertaining movie with a significant and central message, in Other words is not special at least not to be called a masterpiecesave yourself the time sitting in a movie theater and watch it at home by episodes while your are folding clothes, it is war movie without the excitement of the genre and the moral implications of the decisions taken by a few that affect millionsIf you want a better and nore shocking bio pic watch the story of Ray Kroc and McDonalds performed by Michael Keaton."
"The movie has such a great scope to tell relevance of events, story of a human being, story of a conspiracy, story of science, story of relationships, story of nuclear reaction, story of atom bomb, none of which is a selected topic of the movie.Everything is simply touched upon and left an incomplete tell and downplayed to extreme level by the script and editing leaving viewers uninformed, uninterested and not intrigued!Even the intrigue gets killed by constant switching and lack of narration.One of the great example sof story of a man of science supported by how it made an impact to human history and future is well told in Imitation games. Nolan needs to take a good look at it.Yes you can have your own way to tell a story but leaving everything for viewers to find out, interpret, complete is utter waste of money and effort.All the advertising and interviews and great reviews seemed to be coming from the bias and have failed to show any impact when we were in the theatre, concentrating on the movies trying to feel engaged.It failed!"
"I had to rewatch. First time I saw it, I thought it was convoluted with Ludwig Göransson and the sound design as its saving grace. Still felt the same on my rewatch even on IMAX, although with a better understanding of its dense, jargon-heavy storyline, better worship of the sound design, and Göransson ultimately cemented his Oscar nod and his name in my core memory.This is more of a me problem; Oppenheimer in itself is a great filmmaking achievement with an ensemble so sublime from minor to lead roles and two scenes that made me want to scream, ""I love cinema!""This Ken, after all, still needs subtitles."
"Damn, I wanted to love this. I love almost everything Nolan does. But part of the reason I love him is because he's so creative and rarely needs to resort to gratuitous female nudity to make his point. He's better than that. Not here. Could've removed the scenes of Florence's tits and wouldn't have changed one ounce of the story. No reason to include that other than laziness and appeasing men.Movie was beyond boring, fast paced but somehow felt too slow. Didn't care about anyone, and the one bomb scene fell flat. Didn't hold the gravity I think he intended it to. Score was all over the place, seemed forced and nothing about it was moving like his prior movies. I ended up falling asleep for probably 1/3 of it. Left pissed and so disappointed, what a waste of an afternoon. Will never watch this again."
"I found the movie so boring, with a ton of exposition, unending dialog and undue screen time dedicated to the most boring issue which is his security clearance. How could a genius like Nolan not find a more cinematic way to reveal the the characters or consequences of strong opinions by scientific community, than a hearing, not just 1 but 2. . Also how can a movie about a scientist not have any meaningful or educative explanation of nuclear physics or anatomy of the bomb? Even the fictional setup in Inception was explained in a more detailed fashion.Some highlights that I wish they spent more time on:
1) Silence during explosion. Loved that it was an Easter egg for people who love science. It was a choice made not necessarily for an artistic reason but a scientific one, as light travels faster than sound. Wish there were more such.2) When one character tells Strauss that Einstein and Oppen were probably not talking about him, but something important instead. I wish Nolan applied that to his film and realized that spending majority of the movie on Strauss' trial is not as important when the world the movie is set in involves Oppenheimer, Einstein, Atom bomb, WW2, a world after the first nuclear attack, nuclear arms race, the dynamic of great scientific minds from the world coming together to build the bomb/advance science.3) Psychological complexity and catharsis: there were hints at what caused the eventual change of mind within Oppen towards the bomb, but it didn't seem organic to me. Was it triggered by Matt Damon's character ending communication with Oppen, or because of the way the test bombing looked, or hearing Truman announce the attack on Hiroshima on radio? Or meeting Truman?4) Terrific acting all the way.I am huge Nolan fan and my favs are Prestige, Interstellar, Dark Knight Rises."
"Let me talk about the good sides first: The acting was great, except for one person. Now let's get to the bad sides, there are plenty of it: It was a movie that made you tired while watching the movie, but it was not like the brainstorming after watching Inception, it was like Avatar 2 (you can understand if you watched the movie) and it was far from using its time efficiently and it was also not interesting. There were too many unnecessary scenes, for example, the scene where Oppenheimer's sex life is told. Emily Blunt put on bad acting. The actor who performed so well in A Quiet Place did nothing but irritate me here. But I loved the character very much, everything would have been much better if Robert had listened to him and I liked his tactical intelligence. At some moments it seemed to me that he didn't know what the hell he was doing and what he wanted to be. The editing got messed up anyway. He should stop working with Jennifer Lame immediately. Long story short, the movie is not satisfying at all and it is full of strange details from top to bottom. But of course, everyone adores Christopher Nolan, so he will get 9 10 from everywhere in this movie (see: Dunkirk, Teneth the dialogue was not very important in this movie, as well as the dialogue in Dunkirk, which is very disgusting. Either you skip it or it will be shown as details that are not so important by trying it as RDJ. However, this movie was only a 3 hour Wikipedia page for me. To me, it was nothing more than a better scripted and Nolan version of Avatar 2, Oppenheimer. Instead, I prefer to watch Barbie or MI:8 for the 2nd or 3rd time. 1/10."
"The first half feels like you're watching a drawn out movie trailer. Until the bomb scene, there's random build up and tension. Some scenes don't make sense, it builds and builds at like 200 mph then cuts to some random scene. However there are some very well directed scenes w/ great visual effects and music in spots. The first half I'd give a 6. After the trinity test it gets really good IMO w/ great dialogue and some of the best acting, scenes and sequences I've ever seen. It almost seems like Nolan wanted to get across that Oppenheimer wasn't thinking things through and rushed it, and makes sense of the movie in the second half. IdkThe physics stuff is pretty simple, you have to understand the concept of quantum mechanics vs classical Newtonian physics to understand the scenes involving Einstein but overall you don't have to be scientifically adept much at all to understand.Overall solid movie, really enjoyed it."
"Turgid boredom that managed to suck the life out of the awe and brilliance of quantum discovery, portraying seminal theoretical psychists as lowly clerks, and focusing on U. S. commy paranoia. No soundtrack, just a wall of bass. Nolan utterly failed in script. Lighting too dark. No build of tension - you will forget you are there to see the inception of atomic bombs. Not even a courtroom thriller - just endless questioning of Oppenheimer in a room, and a complete fizzle of an atomic explosion. Acting fine, but I'm in the presence of Einstein and checking my watch!?! This should have had huge tension as Nazi's vs. Allies race - you'd hardly know it was WW2. As a warning about A. I., as Christopher Nolan said he had intended, then we are all doomed."
"I got hit by the hype train.It couldn't be different, though: a movie directed by Nolan (who made the all time greatest Interstellar) about the frontman of the project that conceived the doomsday weapon couldn't help but raise high expectations.Well, I fell off the horse.It seemed to be that the script was a little to hurried, specially in the early part, with many abrupt cuts; scenes that seemed interrupted. With all due respect, an horrorshow.The plot is good, after all it is based on one of the most fascinating stories of humanity.The use (I mean abuse) of the greatest scientific discoveries of the time to build a weapon with the potential to destroy the world is something that, I believe, will take centuries of meditation to be properly understood.But I don't know, something seems to be missing... I didn't feel that touch of wonder Nolan usually puts in his films, that we know so well from Interestelar, Inception or even Tenet.PS: For those who haven't read ""un Verdor Terrible"", by Benjamin Labatut, it's really worth it, as the book explores the boundaries between reason and madness of these characters involved with quantum physics (and with weapons of mass destruction, consequently).The movie is good, but the book is much better."
"Worse than Tenet, feels like Nolan lost his capacity to direct, this time he definitely used stock imagery for the special effects in this film. Sound is even worse, you will leave the theatre with a constant high pitch in your ear. And let's not mention the dialogue wich is boring and repetitive. It cuts from one character to another and is more political than impressive. One more thing ...there are cheaper youtube documentaries on this subject that do a better job than this film. Hollywood's last breath and it smells like onions. I want my money back, don't be mislead by the ""masterpiece"" reviews, this belongs in the bin."
"Oppenheimer portrais a very interesting time in history that you can't help but find intriguing, exciting and scary.But I left the cinema thinking this movie could have been made in a hundred different ways, the way this movie was made isn't in the top 20 of best ways.You are thrown into a story without an introduction to who and where, characters are not introduced properly, the movie jumps between 3 time periods without explaining that it does and when is what. Only half way through the movie I understand when the different time periods are.The movie is extremely rushed, as a suspenseful scene thretched over the entire movie, without you being able to catch a breath. Scenes are rushed where dialogue seem fake, rushed and forced.Unfortunately this movie is very poorly written. But because of the interesting topic it touches and good acting I give it a 7, as in it's intertaining. But wouldn't recommend people waste money on it in cinema."
"I try to be honest and consistent with my opinions. I believe in critical thinking and I hope it is not a dying skill.This film is a grandiose homage to some of the greatest minds our civilization ever produced. Nolan's effort here is sincere but quite lacking in real drama. There is little to separate this from a docu-drama that felt a trifle exasperating.I have an engineering background and was familiar with the basic history of the Manhattan project and the prominent characters. I left the theater slightly disoriented with all of the names and actions of the subsequent political players who dominate over half of the film. That's over 90 minutes.I know this is a story about profound philosophical concepts, but I don't feel they were addressed adequately. The opportunity was missed. Instead we are shown a slightly confusing story of jealousy and persecution. The dawn of the Nuclear age is ultimately something we will always have to deal with. I don't feel this film emphasized that enough.Overall I was disappointed, slightly confused, and fatigued."
"Not a big fan of this movie. Nolan has never been about emotional character exploration and a biopic without that feels off. It's not that it's a documentary style, factual biopic which has NPCs for characters that we're not supposed to know about like Dunkirk. That could have worked. But here it's actually about the characters and yet it's missing exploration of any interesting themes in the characters' lives.There are a few great scenes. Nolan is a master of those. But it doesn't take us deep into the mind of Oppenheimer, his guilt, his ptsd in a way that great biopics can do.There's a problem in the style of storytelling in general I think. The first half of the movie is a lot of rushed moments. Dialogues after dialogues like a highlight reel with no real theme that's allowed time to breathe and come out as a narrative anchor of the overall story.The trinity test is where the master truly arrives. It's where Nolan is in his comfort zone, immersing us in a high intensity scene. This is where the movie peaks in every aspect. This is really where it's a spectacular experience on the large imax screen.But otherwise than that, even visually this movie felt mediocre. The colour contrast felt weird in many of the scenes, either being too bright or too dark. It's a weird mix of some moments looking spectacular like you expect from Nolan in imax but others looking off like I've downloaded a torrent.Personally I really dislike Nolan's dialogue. I don't know if my taste has changed or it sticks out more here in a factual biopic but it's just not how people talk. It's smartass Hollywood line after Hollywood line as if the character knows there's an audience and he's trying to look cool in front of them.I'll revise my review after a second viewing if I ever get to that. But for now it's pretty mediocre."
"The first 30 seconds was cinematic genius to introduce this movie, the other 25 minutes I sat through was insanely boring. The dialog was ok, the acting fine, but it felt serious, cold, and emotionless. Nothing exciting was happening, and I wasn't enthralled enough with what was going on to care whatsoever. This is a subject I know a fair bit about, and something I am interested in, and yet recognizing references and historical tie ins could not save this movie for me. No way I was going to waste another 2hours+ on this insanely long and insanely boring movie. Sure I didn't see the whole thing, but it did a terrible job engaging me, and burned 15 dollars from my pocket."
"Oppenheimer is without a doubt a unique cinematic experience and I would encourage everyone to watch it on the big screen. However this movie is not made for everybody.Typically for Nolan, this movie expects a lot from its audience and if you have little to no historic knowledge you will have problems following the story. For me personally this historic accuracy was one of the best parts of the movie as I am highly interested in history.My biggest problem with Oppenheimer was definitely its storytelling. The pacing in Oppenheimer is incredibly high and its story is told in 6 different time periods. As the different time periods are not shown in cronological order, this can be confusing/hard to follow at times. There is also never a silent/slow moment in this movie where we can deeply delve into the mind of the tragic protagonist.Some of these slow moments would have improved the movie a lot imo as it would have helped to get a deeper character study of Oppenheimer, whose troubles and pangs of conscience are sadly mostly covered on a surface level.I would have prefered a complex character study but I dont think Nolan is the ideal director for this.All in all this movie is highly entertaining and definitely leaves an impact but I must say that I think the story of Oppenheimer could have been told in a better way."
"Dont waste time watching, the whole cinema were sleeping , its too long , too boring, no story, streteched for nothing, every moment you are waiting for something to happen.Easily it could be 1hour shorterThe story was boringNo rhythm in the whole movie and if the movie was not for nolan im sure it would not sell 100,000$ even , i feel bad that nolan is having this in his edpeirence ,I was sleeping 30 minutes of the movie as it was completely boring and if you watch jt you will be sleeping as well , there waa totally no interesting atory and mo surprise in the story plus the visial effects were terrible."
"We knew what we were in for, we know the history, yet Christopher Nolan managed to knock it out of the park. He was not wrong when Nolan said Oppenheimer was his most abstract work. I will be honest, I liked the latter part of the movie much more. We could see the shades of grey in each character. Every actor did a splendid job, especially Cillian Murphy, he was exceptional and I would be shocked if he was not at least nominated for Oscars.Although I was not fortunate enough to watch it in IMAX, I loved the cinematography, loved Nolan's vision. I think I might have to watch it a second time!"
"Let me talk about the good sides first: The acting was great, except for one person. Now let's get to the bad sides, there are plenty of it: It was a movie that made you tired while watching the movie, but it was not like the brainstorming after watching Inception, it was like Avatar 2 (you can understand if you watched the movie) and it was far from using its time efficiently and it was also not interesting. There were too many unnecessary scenes, for example, the scene where Oppenheimer's sex life is told. Emily Blunt put on bad acting. The actor who performed so well in A Quiet Place did nothing but irritate me here. But I loved the character very much, everything would have been much better if Robert had listened to him and I liked his tactical intelligence. At some moments it seemed to me that he didn't know what the hell he was doing and what he wanted to be. The editing got messed up anyway. He should stop working with Jennifer Lame immediately. Long story short, the movie is not satisfying at all and it is full of strange details from top to bottom. But of course, everyone adores Christopher Nolan, so he will get 9 10 from everywhere in this movie (see: Dunkirk, Teneth the dialogue was not very important in this movie, as well as the dialogue in Dunkirk, which is very disgusting. Either you skip it or it will be shown as details that are not so important by trying it as RDJ. However, this movie was only a 3 hour Wikipedia page for me. To me, it was nothing more than a better scripted and Nolan version of Avatar 2, Oppenheimer. Instead, I prefer to watch Barbie or MI:8 for the 2nd or 3rd time. 6/10."
"Music, cinematography, acting 10/10!The actual story was 7/10 at best! I really like Nolan but this was not it!First hour was a bit confusing with all the names and timelines but ok, it's a buildup!Second hour was very good! My favourite!Last hour I was looking for toothpicks around cinema to hold my eyelids open! Couple in front if me had a bottle of wine and fell asleep long time ago! One whole hour too long! I feel it could've been told in more interesting way!If you like drama with lots of political and scientific chat, you will love it! I just need to feel more entertained at the cinema!"
"The movie left me with mixed feelings as it attempted to explore the theme of regret and redemption. While the star-studded cast was impressive, it wasn't enough to salvage the film's weak execution. The plot felt disconnected from the intended message, leading to a lack of engagement. Additionally, the movie suffered from being overly long, with some scenes dragging on and loud, distracting elements. Regrettably, the film relied too heavily on the fame of its cast, neglecting to invest in a compelling story or well-developed characters. As a result, it failed to captivate and left me feeling disappointed."
"I understand that Nolan knows his craft and his scripts are like you learned it at school. His actors are, as expected, perfect, even in smaller parts. Yet, after three hours, I left the IMAX unsatisfied. No, it was not the ending, that was predictable. I simply don't understand why it took so long to tell a rather simple story. Don't get me wrong, the story is rightfully told, but sometimes I felt all the flashbacks, the continous enjoying soundtrack and repeating similar biographical details are there to simulate greatness. Camerawork is professional but far from being extraordinary and this goes for much of the movie.In the end, despite of the masses flooding the IMAXs, interviews and making of s evoke expectations that are just partially fulfilled.May be everything was too perfect to completely disappoint but falls short to be really great."
"There is first in every thing.There two director/writer I admire and I always believed that there are flueless in movies making.But Tarantino with his movie Once Upon a Time in Hollywood; have disappointed me. I really was thinking there will be no good movie in recent future. Unless Christopher Nola made new movie; So Nolan was my last chance of bringing back my passion twored theater.But nahhhh. With his movie Oppenheimere he success in making the viewers distracted and confused with messy scenes mixing.Do you believe me this movie have no out take. (zoom out).I express ny concerns about the accuracy and portrayal of certain historical events and figures. Additionally, the pacing or storytelling choices, feeling that it may not have effectively conveyed the complexity and impact of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life and work."
"Along with Barbie, this was one of the most hyped-up movies of the year, both films were released the same day, they are complete polar opposites, and the phenomenon spawned a social media trend called ""Barbenheimer"", to see both films as a double feature. I did not personally do this craze, I booked both films on the same day but saw them separately, I looked forward to this film with its darker subject matter, written and directed by Christopher Nolan (Inception, The Dark Knight, Dunkirk, Tenet). Basically (in linear order), in 1926, twenty-two-year-old (Julius) J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is studying at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, under Patrick Blackett (James D'Arcy), but he suffers from homesickness and anxiety. After Blackett forces him to miss part of a lecture, Oppenheimer injects an apple left for him with cyanide. The next day, he has a change of heart and narrowly prevents visiting scientist Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) from eating it. Oppenheimer completes his PhD in physics at the University of Göttingen in Germany, where he meets Werner Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighöfer). Returning to the United States, Oppenheimer hopes to expand quantum physics research, and begins teaching at the University of California, Berkeley and the California Institute of Technology. He meets and is infatuated with biologist and ex-communist Katherine ""Kitty"" Puening (Emily Blunt), his future wife. He also has a sporadic affair with Communist Party USA member Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), but she had severe clinical depression and committed suicide, submerging her head in a partly filled bathtub. In 1942, during World War II, U. S. Army General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) recruits Oppenheimer to lead the Manhattan Project to develop an atomic bomb after he assures the general that he has no sympathy with the communists. Oppenheimer, who is Jewish, is particularly driven by the Nazis, under Heisenberg's supervision, possibly trying to complete their nuclear weapons program. Oppenheimer assembles a scientific team including Edward Teller (Benny Safdie) and Isidor Isaac Rabi (David Krumholtz) in Los Alamos, New Mexico. There, a town is built in the middle of the desert, and the workers are encouraged to bring their wives who will work on site while the bomb is secretly created. He coordinates with other sites, including the Met Lab in Chicago, where he meets with nuclear physicists Enrico Fermi (Danny Deferrari) and David L. Hill (Rami Malek). He also visits Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) to discuss how an atomic bomb could trigger an unstoppable chain reaction that could destroy the world. When Germany surrenders and the war is approaching its end, there is doubt from some of the scientists of the project's importance, but Oppenheimer assures them that the bomb could be used to end the war with Japan. The atomic bomb is completed, and the countdown begins as the Trinity test, which takes place just before the Potsdam Conference on 16 July 1945. The detonation of the prototype device in the desert is a complete success. President Harry S. Truman (Gary Oldman) orders atomic bombs to be dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, forcing Japan to surrender. Oppenheimer is thrust into the public eye, including on the cover of Time magazine, as the ""father of the atomic bomb."" But Oppenheimer feels personal responsible and is haunted by the destruction and suffering. Oppenheimer meets Truman and urges him to close Los Alamos and not develop even more powerful weapons. Truman perceives Oppenheimer's distress as weakness and insists that, as President, he is responsible for the use of the bomb. Oppenheimer advocates against further nuclear development, especially the hydrogen bomb proposed by Teller. His stance creates disagreements in the middle of the tension building in Soviet Union that is leading up to the Cold War. Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), chairman of the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission, resents Oppenheimer for publicly dismissing his concerns regarding the export of radioisotopes and for recommending arms talks after the Soviets detonate their first atomic bomb. He also believes Oppenheimer, when meeting Einstein, criticised him. Oppenheimer is called to a hearing where he is betrayed by Teller and other associates intending to remove him from political influence. Strauss exploits Oppenheimer associating with current and former communists such as Tatlock and his own brother, Frank (Dylan Arnold). Despite Rabi and several other allies defending Oppenheimer in their testimonies, Oppenheimer's security clearance is prematurely revoked. Oppenheimer's public image is damaged, and his policy influence is neutralised. Five years later, at Strauss's Senate confirmation hearing to become Secretary of Commerce, Hill testifies that Strauss has personal motives when engineering Oppenheimer's downfall. The Senate votes against Strauss's nomination. An enraged Strauss meets Oppenheimer in private, ranting against him being a hypocrite, saying if had the chance he would do it again because it made him important. In 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson (Hap Lawrence) presents Oppenheimer the Enrico Fermi Award as a gesture of political rehabilitation. Oppenheimer and Einstein's conversation is revealed to have not been about Strauss, but the far-reaching implications of nuclear weapons. Oppenheimer ominously states that he believes his actions have indeed started a chain reaction that will destroy the world. Also starring Casey Affleck as Boris Pash, A Cure for Wellness's Dane DeHaan as Major General Kenneth Nichols, Jason Clarke as Roger Robb, Alden Ehrenreich as Senate Aide, Gustaf Skarsgård (Stellan's son) as Hans Bethe, Michael Angarano as Robert Serber, Jack Quaid as Richard Feynman, Josh Peck as Kenneth Bainbridge, Olivia Thirlby as Lilli Hornig, Matthew Modine as Vannevar Bush, Tony Goldwyn as Gordon Gray, Alex Wolff as Luis Walter Alvarez, Emma Dumont as Jackie Oppenheimer, Scott Grimes as Counsel, and James Remar as Secretary of War Henry Stimson. Murphy is perfectly cast as the title character, and he is supported by a terrific all-star cast, including Blunt as his supportive wife, Damon as the general, Downey Jr. As the businessman, Pugh as the sultry mistress, Branagh as a teacher, and Oldman as the President of the United States. Nolan is no stranger to big scale blockbusters and does a fine job telling the true story of the scientist who developed the atom bomb. The non-linear storytelling, scientific jargon and political stuff, and the three-hour running time test your patience, and I'm not sure what the point of the bits in black-and-white were, but for the tense first bomb test scene, its fantastic editing, visuals, and sound design (the delayed explosion genuinely startled me) is the highlight. It is very long and very chatty, but Murphy and the ensemble cast are all great, it is ambitious, dramatic, stylish, and historically interesting, a worthwhile biographical thriller. Very good!"
"This is one of the most tedious boring fims I have seen in a long time. 3 hours was about 21/2 hours too long. Unless you actually knew the history you would not be much wiser. How many people know how thermonuclear fission and fusion work and why it was so important. Odd bits were good but the constant jumping about was annoying. The casting was stereotyped although the actors did the best they could in the circumstances. And why did the sound have to be so deafening? The visual effects were cliched. Real pictures of an atomic bomb going off are dramatic enough without the swirling clouds. PS I hated Dunkirk too so I guess I am in the minority. I yearn for the days of cinema when there was a good story, well told and well acted. David Lean where are you? (I gues that gives my age away!)"
"Don't get me wrong, the main actor did an outstanding effort, but I felt like the physics visions represented in particles were cheesy, the moment with Jean where he was quoting Bhagavad Gita, when in real life he was quoting it in an interview where he clearly had PTSD was tasteless to be portrayed in a sex scene, the portrayal of his wife as an empowered strong woman when in real life she had severe alcoholism and even broke bones and had car accidents due to her alcoholism was inaccurate, the scene showing him and his affair partner sleeping together in the interrogation room as she was staring his wife into the eyes, when his wife was quite detached from the whole affair ordeal, also unnecessary.Furthermore, why would you portray Niels Bohr, a Dane, and give him a vague Dutch accent when he's clearly Scandinavian. Why would you show Niels Bohr nearly biting into the apple when that never actually happened, no one bit the apple, and actually Oppenheimer was almost expelled due to what he'd done. And why would you portray Einstein as a man who behaves like a semi-homeless man is beyond me. Also, the PTSD scenes were underwhelming at best. And also, Jean was a psychiatrist, in the movie she was portrayed as a lesser intelligent younger girl he was sexually infatuated with.Great acting, but the script and production could have been better."
"Actually saying I wasted 3 hours of my life is a bit harsh. This movie did hold my attention for most of the time and I only dozed off once. Perhaps if I had been more prepared and brushed up on my history, it would probably have been better. I had absolutely no idea who most of the people were or what their actual significance was, politically or otherwise. I'm a bit embarrassed that I didn't know more about them as I am 67 years old and my dad served overseas in WW2. I went to see the movie with three friends who are in their 70's and I don't believe they got much if any more out of it than I did. It was a very disappointing movie for all of us.Maybe I will read up on the people in the film and who they actually were, watch it again when it is available on streaming platforms, and may give a better rating."
"I thought the acting in this film was exceptional, to a person. I also didn't think it was too long, and it covered everything that seemed important. My only gripe is the fact that the musical score dominated the film and felt manipulative. In that I mean that there was enough tension and excitement without hearing a thousand violins ramping up the tension. It often was simply too loud. And it made it harder to really hear the dialogue. The scenes I found most satisfying were those where the music was muted and the dialogue came through.I guess as a woman, I felt the portrayals of the two main women, his wife and his troubled lover, probably made them look less capable than they really were. The exception being the late scene when his wife faces the investigating panel."
"Being a huge Nolan fan(Interstellar is my favourite movie of all time) I had so high expectations going in the cinema for this one...oh boy was I disappointed! It was partly my fault,having listened to all the praise..masterpiece here..best biopic movie ever there..all the hype was created. For what? For a movie that just feels like a series of trailers with the music and the score,instead of being complimentary to the film and create such an important vibe throughout all Nolan film ,it ended being so distracting..always like keeping you on the edge of your seat like something important will happen. But it never does,it is just endless boring,complicated and hard to follow dialogue after dialogue. There are so many characters in the movie that you just do not care for..I didnt care what hapoens to Oppenheimer himself,Emily Blunt..Robert Downey jr.... Sure,they are great actors,but there is nothing to root for the characters they play.."
"Ok so i just watched the movie and it was like i expected: a movie about Oppenheimer and his work arround the bombs, his relationship(loves, friends). I definitely learnt more trough the movie. I saw Tenet and there was a reference to Oppenheimer in the movie pretty briefly. And there we are. So the main question in my opinion is: what liberty they took? For dramatic or plot purposes? Or they tried to get as close as the events of that man that we knew. I dont really know. I still was impressed by the visuals, the sound design and the editing. For the dramatic moments (Trinity, the revelation about who really is Teller, the interrogation by the autorities.), the sexual moments (i enjoyed that scene that where he admit that he had an affair with Jean and we had that sexual scene in the middle of the interview where we saw also the wife of Oppenheimer who realised that she get cheated on, mostly also the scenes with Jean -a wonderful body that she has.).the sound design really make the tension escalate more and let us speechless during the bomb test. Im not gonna lie; i found also some moments more intellectual, a little bit too much characters and sometimes it was more boring because of the pace (the details, the slow rythm, the physicians theories and conspiracy )that i had some problems to remembered but except that it was a kind of nice visual experience with a big deep dive into Oppenheimer's life who was pretty dramatic and let us pretty aware of the repercussions of his works for the good reasons and the bad ones. I need also to mention the performances of Cillian Murphy (it was not easy to represent such a man), Matt Damon (its been a long time that i didnt see him in the movies except for the Jason Bourne movies), Florence Pugh (for the sensuality that she brings). Rami Malek that i clearly didnt expect to see. And of Course Robert Downey JR who has a complex character with his words and his status (ally or ennemy?). I need to say that i usually like to see Emily Blunt on screen but here she was really forgettable maybe because she represented just the woman of Oppenheimer and didnt really see an interesting performance from her here but you know she did the job and let us know more trough her who was Oppenheimer at least how they decided to represent him in the movie."
"I honestly start believing that critics are bought once I see this one with a highscore. Nolan told us that we should watch it on a specific theater only to see 90% of a really lenghty movie being dining rooms and boring political/military inquest. There is no sense of real danger in the whole movie, the script feels really flat and uninteresting and it's hard to empathise with the main character when we have over a dozen of other characters revolving around him. Robert Downey Jr's entire plot is tedious and they try to give out some sort of plot twist around him that does not work well and there is also unnecessary nudity that I thought had died in the 00s. Worst work from Nolan, easily. I grant you one thing if you're going to risk wasting your time on the theaters one thing: boredom."
"He watched a movie full of good dialogues, but I did not find excitement in the story, its excitement could be historical, and I did not see the expected explosion, or even the Japanese. I was hoping that he would show what the people who were hit by the bomb suffered and tell him from the stories of one of the citizens so that we feel real grief for them. What is in the second half of the film is semi-arbitrary and limited to the security clearance, so I found that the film is not what we expected. Apparently, the film fell in front of government rules in order not to show what all countries did in World War II. Also, Einstein character was not accurate in his makeup."
"Overall I think this was a good film.The cast and their performance was by far the best part of this movie. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Had by far the best performances out of this entire roster of new and budding stars. I was a little disappointed with Matt Damon's performance as it was tough for me to believe he was a general, he just didn't convince me. My last gripe with the cast was that Rami Malek had three scenes and the first two he spoke a singular word. The last scene he was in he stole screen as was the intent but I digress.The most annoying thing to me was the pacing being inconsistent and jumping too much from timeline to timeline with each cut. If the amount of cuts were halved I feel this movie would be soooo much better. Just imagine having twice as much time with these characters and maybe getting to see some actual depth with them before jumping back and forth in the TL.Lastly, the music was horrendous. Simply put, there was no reason for the music to get so intense and loud during the interrogation at the end. I feel as if the raw emotion from those two actors would've been plenty for tension."
"Oppenheimer (2023)The story of American scientist, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and his role in the development of the atomic bomb.His struggles and emotions after bombing into Hiroshima and Nagasaki stated good....
There is no vfs in this movie...
But need to have more interest in science and history..
Otherwise u shld hv more patience to understand the movie...
I hope one time watchable movie..!The story of American scientist, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and his role in the development of the atomic bomb.His struggles and emotions after bombing into Hiroshima and Nagasaki stated good....
There is no vfs in this movie...
But need to have more interest in science and history..
Otherwise u shld hv more patience to understand the movie...
I hope one time watchable movie..!"
"In this movie you will learn nothing about history or science. Nothing about emotions. Nothing about geo politics. It looks quite nice. Maybe it could have been ok if edited to 2 hours. 3 hours implies an epic. But this movie was just not epic in scale. To be an epic, it would have had to go outside Oppenheimer's bubble. About 1 hours was dedicated to his trial of ""security clearance"", who honestly cares about that. The Albert Einstein character was kind of like a Santa Claus type figure, not an actual person. It was just boring. I feel like an idiot spending money to see this, encouraging this false intellectual movie. Let's face it, all biography movies are not actually good movies, except Walk Hard (a parody), and I'm Not Here ( didn't use the typical biography format)."
"Don't expect to be entertained while watching this movie. This film might inform you on the life of Robert Oppenheimer and might even stimulate you intellectually, but not in a fun or engaging way. It demands careful attention all the way through, with about 80% of the movie being heavy dialogue, the contents of which are hardly discernible without subtitles. Perhaps I went into the theater with the wrong expectations (and after Tenet, I probably should have known better) but I didn't expect to have to absord and retain so much information in order to not get lost at some point in the movie's 180 minutes long runtime.So why a 6, then? Well, even though the plot represented the epitome of tedium, the acting was top-notch, the dialogue was well-written (even though it requires a C2 proficiency level in English to fully understand), the score was fantastic and the cinematography was amazing. These factors bring the movie to an above-average rating."
"I had hoped to see more information regarding the creation of the explosives. For instance, I was positive that the movie would include the dragon's tail being tickled, yet it was not even mentioned. I was expecting for a movie with stuff like that. Do a search for Slotin, Daghlian, and tickling the dragon's tail if you are unfamiliar with this. In order to see what happens immediately before criticality, Slotin essentially moved two hemispheres of nuclear material slightly closer to one another. Oops! I know, big blunder. These events, I presume, weren't included since the majority of the movie had already ended by the time they occurred, which was after Hiroshima and Nagasaki."
"It felt like a very long trailer, not a movie. I don't think there is a conversation in the movie for more than a few minutes. Every scene wants to have you surprised, and honestly, it felt ridiculous after a while. Disappointing storyline. It rather failed to depict Oppenheimer as a real person and scientist. Nolan pictured him as an absolute hero. The conversation around quantum physics and nuclear physics in the movie was a bit shallow and short. There are a lot of great movies and series based on the work of real scientists, such as A beautiful mind, Chernobyl, or Imitation Game which explain their research and achievements with a simplified language for the audience and build the movie around that. The movie was very nationalistic and patriarchal. Just because he's American, there is a notion in the movie that he was the best in his field then. At the time that Einstein, Planck, Schrödinger, and Heisenberg were alive. And the most frustrating part was the representation of women. Drunk, mentally unstable, and angry at all times. It became a pattern in Nolan's movies, I think. All his main characters are men surrounded by dozens of more men. Usually, put one or two women at most in them.The acting was terrific, and almost all of the cast did a fantastic job. I really enjoyed the music; however, it was three hours of non-stop music."
"The lack of action and slow pace of the movie made it incredibly dull to watch. In the first part, the characters seemed to do nothing but engage in lengthy conversations that failed to captivate the audience. The only saving grace was the music, which managed to inject some much-needed excitement into an otherwise monotonous storyline.Fortunately, the second part of the film showed some improvement. It offered a slightly more engaging plot and managed to hold my attention to some extent. However, even with this slight improvement, it still fell short of redeeming itself entirely.All in all, I must say that watching this movie was a waste of time."
"I am surprised at the interest in this film. I doubt that most americans know who oppenheimer is. We can't find florida on a map. Of course the ads started over a year ago and the tie in to the barbie opening helped. No one wants to be left out of an ""event"". As for the film itself, it's long. The person across the aisle checking the time didn't make it shorter. And it doesn't really focus on dropping the bombs, but on robert oppenheimer's dilemma with what he had wrought. Because his ideas were not popular in the early 50's, a very scary time in the usa, they did all they could do to shut him up and discredit him. As for the actors, hats off to robert downey, jr. He steals the show. But like the movie, you get tired of him, too. So go, join the crowds and you can tell your friends you saw oppenheimer. Knock yourself out."
"""Oppenheimer"" disappoints with lackluster cinematography, bland dialogue and a poorly written screenplay. The visuals lack depth, leaving viewers detached, while wooden dialogue fails to engage. Moreover, ""Oppenheimer"" perpetuates the narrative of male hegemony, while women appear briefly and unnecessarily naked on screen.The narrative lacks cohesion, with scenes disjointed and poorly connected, leaving viewers struggling to follow the story's progression. Characters often behave in inexplicable ways, leaving audiences perplexed and disinterested in their fates.From the sluggish pace to the monotonous dialogue, every aspect contributes to the overwhelming feeling of boredom. Unfortunately, it falls short of being a compelling cinematic experience, leaving viewers counting down the minutes until the credits roll."
"Long , boring , overrated
Nolan movies lately become disappointing with make no sense loud soundtracks, literally in the middle of the scene who every one talking and these soundtracks keep going for no reason , the first hour it's really good but more than half the movie just waiting for the bomb to drop and end the movie, every think going fast even with 3 hrs movie , u don't feel any felling for the characters because everything fast , I think Nolan should not use the same style in every movies and back to the old style like prestige and momento which more normal and fell more for the characters than his late movies like dunkirk and tenet , I gave the movie 6 because the beautiful shot and directing."
"So many western bots leaving 10 star reviews here.All of this hype regarding some German nerd who created a bang? Ridiculous!There are many people in the world who are far superior to this Floppenheimer person. A truly evil man.He creates a bang and the world goes crazy to see a film based on this triviality? Ridiculous.Anyone can make a bang. Have you people not heard of fireworks for goodness sake?We all experience bangs every year at firework displays. Why should we all get excited and respectful about some nobody who made a bang?The acting is average at best, the story is boring, the costumes and period detail is inaccurate.Terrible movie.Kurt Affair."
"I have to give Nolan a lot of credit: he is one of the few directors that always manage to fill the theater. The film is beautifully shot and highlights a lot of issues from American politics during the war time, together with some questionable choices that were made, in the name of putting an end to World War II. The director managed to portray really well the moral dilemma that a lot of scientists that worked on the H Bomb felt, realizing that they basically created a mass destruction weapon. There are never particularly gruesome images, but the editing together with the soundtrack, really highlights the terrible consequences that this invention caused. This movie has an incredible sound design, and there are some sequences that are just breathtaking. Nolan always delivered technically competent movies and he is unique in his genre: the practical effects on this one are absolutely jaw dropping.""Oppenheimer"" is three hours long and it has a pretty intense and interesting story. Unfortunately at times it focuses too much on irrelevant matters, such as the incredibly intense romantic life of the physicist, or the whole communist witch hunt made by a special commission towards the scientist, in order to discredit him. There are tons of scenes that are very repetitive and that they could have just been trimmed from the final cut. I have to be honest: towards the end I was really wondering when the flick was going to finish. Even though I enjoy longer movies that take their time to develop a deeper plot, this one was a bit too much even for a cinema lover like me. It is a solid 7.5 stars out of 10 and I definitely recommend it, as I think that after the disastrous ""Tenet"", here Nolan did overall a good job."
"As a die hard Nolan fan this film missed hard.It's way too long for starters. It's basically two separate movies. The token time twist Nolan uses was nothing more than a flashback which really didn't do much other than let us watch two movies simultaneously.The soundtrack was eh. There was only one stunning visuals scene, so IMAX is wasted. The story/characters didn't really have any emotional pull for me. Not like Interstellar, Inception, Prestige, Dark Knight. No real twist at the end that makes you think. Whoa!RDJ did great and was thr standout for me. Especially seeing him get away from being Tony Stark.Emily Blunt also had an amazing scene near the end but unfortunately her role was minimal in the story.The trailers made this out to be more of a thriller espionage style film, instead we get a lot of science talk no where near as cool as Interstellar and a lawyer hearing interrogation that isn't a trial with no tension.Bummer since I was really looking forward to this one. Just wait and rent it."
"Oppenheimer is less of a movie and more of an experience. It tells the story of the man who was the head of the Manhattan project, and what his life was life before, during and after the creation of the atomic bomb.Much like the biopic of Elvis that acme out last year, this movie goes fast and throws a lot of stuff at the audience at breakneck speed- but when all is said and done you understand the story of Oppenheimer.The films strengths are the sequence that delve into the destructive nature of the weapons he built, and how that impacted the world and why he first championed them and later spoke against them and became an advocate for disarmament.The weakness of the movie is that the lead isn't that strong to hold the film together (although he looks like Oppenheimer) and it's not knock on the actor but he isn't really leading movie material for a major motion picture of this nature. You never really know or care much about Oppenheimer, more than you observe him and while that may have been the point it was hard to watch a three hour film about someone you can't really identify with.Some of Nolan's script choices in this film are kind of poor - such as he never lets us see Oppenheimer do much that makes us bond with him - and he never really establishes the relationship between Oppenheimer and his nemesis who puts the federal government against him.The great moments in the film is when Oppenheimer goes to talk to Truman - and Gary Oldman delivers big time in that scene and you really get a sense of how history transpired.Overal, Oppenheimer is a good Christopher Nolan movie and a thought provoking Biopic of an important historical character, but also a sort of spy thriller and a mystery wrapped into one. A few too many elements possibly - but it's never boring.Recommended if you like Christopher Nolan movies."
"There is a famous Einstein quote: ""If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."" In my opinion Nolan failed to explain it simply. Oh don't get me wrong I loved Inception, Interstellar and Dunkirk even though TBH I didn't understand Interstellar fully.I had great expectations from Oppenheimer, I wanted to watch it first day as it is about Manhattan project and Nolan made it. But I am disappointed as the move is all over the place. It fails to catch audiences' attention throughout the film, even I wanted to focus and try to understand but the movie was all over place. There is no doubt Cillian , RDJ, Emily and others were great in the movie, they are all great actors, but according to me the movie the fell short of what we expect of Nolan. From Nolan we expect our intellect joy and mind blown but nothing happened as such instead I got bored in few scenes."
"""Oppenheimer"" is a captivating character study that sheds light on the life of the esteemed physicist, J. Robert Oppenheimer, while exploring the historical backdrop of the atomic bomb. The film's unique perspective focuses on the man himself, rather than solely on the bomb's development, cleverly reflecting its title's significance.Throughout the movie, Oppenheimer's intriguing journey takes center stage, drawing viewers into the complexities of his personality and the pivotal role he played in shaping history. The story gracefully weaves together his struggles, motivations, and ethical dilemmas, making for a compelling narrative that keeps audiences engaged.While the film's emphasis on the man behind the bomb is a refreshing approach, some viewers might find it slightly underwhelming due to its occasionally bloated run time. Certain scenes could have been tightened to maintain a more consistent pace, allowing for a more impactful viewing experience.The film is filled head to toe with a talented cast that
bring depth and authenticity to the characters, keeping the audience invested in Oppenheimer's personal journey. The cast, delivered compelling portrayals that truly breathed life into their characters. It's unfortunate, though, that some of the major actors seemed underutilized, leaving me yearning for more depth in their roles.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a movie that offers a fresh perspective on history by shining a spotlight on the enigmatic scientist. Despite its occasional pacing issues, the film's unique focus on the man himself adds depth and intrigue to an already fascinating historical period. For those interested in character-driven narratives with a touch of historical context, ""Oppenheimer"" is a worthwhile and thought-provoking watch."
"The connection with the movie is only atomic in nature .Even an atomic blast could'nt make it click with the audience..never seen such an uni lnterested crowd..by the time the atomic bomb was tested the fuse in the theater was already blown...And the rest of the politics and board room ,the average asian viewer would'nt understand or even care . Movie made with a very specific audience American population in mind..half of don't know the basics of the politics involved and the movie failed to generate any affiliation to anything mentioned...Didn't feel any gripping.High point of the movie is the atomic.bomb test and the blast silence...
Low point : pretty much the whole movie .And the conspiracy part and all just doesn't click with the audience who really have no clue what was going on. Not a great watch for an average movie goer .. Better discovery channel documentaries are available."
"This movie feels way to fast. There are no breathers except when they are detonating the testbomb, it was a welcome change of pace. The whole movie feels compressed and rushed. If this was an 10 episode (10 hour total) series like chernobyl this would have been phenomenal and maybe even out doing chernobyl itself. The story can easily do 10 hours of fotage.Cillian Murhpy is what makes this movie reach for the higher ratings and together with Christopher Nolans excellent expertise in making outstanding griping scenes you dont even have to understand what is happening to appriciete this movie. That is why i have it an 8 even though it can be hard to follow."
"This movie should be on OTT, not theater, there is nothing IMAX worthy or 70mm justified, absolute waste of time and one of Nolan's worst, where the is guy who made exciting movies like Batman, Inception, Interstellar
What nonsense, the critics gave it 100 and such high ratings .. there is nothing in the movie that excites you
It's a boring , time testing , nonsense of a movie
I want my money back. I went with a friend and we wanted to leave 1/2 way through and we just were ready to get up but thought maybe give it a chance maybe there will be a twist or something .. nope
Oh gosh how we regretted. Trust me, save your money and go watch MI."
"Huge Nolan fan here, but I was expecting more. More engaging history, a trial? He commited a crime? I didnt get that, I needed to chek goggle to know why this movie spend so much time in the trial. Was the trial a third of Oppie life?Really?I have seen this with Oliver Stone?Was Nolan confuse with this movie?Does the book digested all of Oppenheimer issue?I get out of the cinema with more questions than answers. Was that Nolan´s objetive? Sorry for my english.I think the three parts of this movie where mot in touch in some points, I didnt know who where who. I was confused to the point to ask myself: why i am still here. This looks like a documentary or a realiity show."
"It's a huge pile of rubbish. This film is a terrible show in terms of entertainment. The two hours pass only with talking. Names, names, names... communist party, politics, and so on. If I wanted this level of detail, I would have read a book. Why am I even coming to the cinema? Because I'm looking for entertainment. Due to this guy's ""I won't use CGI"" approach, we have to watch something that looks like a photo with added sound. There are so many dialogues in the movie that after a while, you lose track of the plot, and it becomes torture. I had to leave the theater because I couldn't breathe, and my brain neurons collapsed. I've never seen anything more embarrassing in my life. I don't even know if anything was shown in the last 15 minutes, and I don't care anymore."
"The movie was incredibly well done...for the first two hours. The last hour could have been written out as post script in the credits.Great filming and great acting, but they were carrying two separate movies-worth by the end.The difference between a good chef and a great chef is timing. I think that the same can be applied to movies: it can have the best acting, the best story to tell, the best filming, but if the timing is off-the whole movie suffers.I feel if you watched it again, the second storyline might catch on better. I cannot say I will be rushing back to rewatch it though. Maybe eventually."
"Boring Boring Boring
* Christopher Nolan worst movie, I'm Big fan of Mr. Nolan direction and story.* But this movie is only same like documentary of Atomic scientist, in second half it was very hard to watch.* As only court trail was in the movie & in first half they will only show case how they created atomic bomb via theoretically and lots of discussion in room for the same.* They did not showcase any bombing how it was done in Japan and what was the consequences.* Don't watch in cinemas as this can be bearable on OTT!!!* In short (Don't waste your money and most important your time)."
"Christopher Nolan has brought us an amazing story once again, visually pleasing, as well as amazing acting in the movie. If you love history this movie is down your alley.Cillian Murphy delivered an amazing performance as Oppenheimer, loved his acting and never got tired of it during the three hour long movie, and all the other actors did amazing as well.My only major complaint was that the third act kind of dragged on a little unnecessary, at least if felt like that. But the movie was still amazing.So many actors that some would not even notice that they just watched Gary Oldman on the screen, a true masterpiece though I wouldn't give it a ten out of ten."
"Movie was too long. Lot of effort went into the production of this film though. Characters were well represented. Musical score was well done. Dialogue was overbearing. Expected the movie plot to include the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Really exhausting trying to follow all of the names and characters throughout the movie. I wouldn't put it in the top 250 of all time though. It would have been a lot more effective if it were shortened and some of the scenes were deleted. It is good to get back to better produced and directed movies after having gone through the Covid era. Yet, I probably won't watch this one again."
"While watching this, I felt overwhelmed and confused, wishing I had read a book or two about Oppenheimer before seeing the movie. I was frequently lost by the jumping around in time - without anything to clarify what year it was. And all the scientists that he worked with! I kept hearing about the ""Chevalier effect"" which was apparently a bad thing, but I missed WHY was that bad?And then there was the horrible interrogations of Oppenheimer's friends and family. There was so much in this movie that wasn't explained..... or it was and my brain was still trying to figure out what happened five minutes ago. And what year is it now (in the movie!) ????Cillian Murphy was great. Robert Downey was great, and killed any memories of him being typecast as Iron Man. Matt Damon was more impressive than he's been in awhile. The test bomb exploding was good (not great... and it made me wonder about the fallout in 1945 - any health hazards to the workers?)My brain still hurts. This is one 3 hour movie I know I won't be rewatching."
"This movie was supposed to be Christopher Nolan's crowning achievement as a director and instead is an unintelligible mess because he still apparently refuses to have a decent dialog track. The entire movie is marred by muddy dialog and requires so much concentration to understand that you can't even enjoy it. It has to be one of the worst theatrical experiences I've had in recent memory, I'd have expected it to be a technical issue it was so bad but was told by the staff at the theater this was just the way it is. Since it is a Christopher Nolan picture, I'm not surprised. He's had similar issues in the past most recently with Tenant where, according to interviews with Nolan, he intentionally covered up dialog. I had to watch it with subtitles at home just to figure out what was going on.I had recently seen Mission Impossible in the exact same auditorium and it exhibited no such issues. Both pictures were views in IMAX and yet Nolan just can't get his head out of his rear to realize that yes, people do want to hear what the characters are speaking. It is suppose to be all atmosphere.The second huge complaint is the necessary nudity. I'm no prude but if you put it in there you should have a point. I know Nolan probably wanted to show how ""exposed"" his characters were and literally expose them but it was completely unnecessary and uncomfortable in a mixed audience because of the length of the scenes. I get the impression he just said screw it, I got the R rating so let me just take advantage of it. There is a long scene with the characters talking just full out seated nude. Why? What was the point?Cilian Murphy was excellent in his role as Oppenheimer. The standout performance was Robert Downey Jr though. He was incredibly nuanced and spot on in his performance. Emily Blunt, who I love, was fantastic but her presence in the movie was sparse. Matt Damon is, well Matt Damon, and is perfect for the role he played.This is a classic overhyped movie that comes crashing down because of the hubris of its director. I wanted desperately to like this move. I had been anticipating this and love the source material but left disappointed and upset because I wasted an entire afternoon."
"In the beginning of the movie, I kinda got bored, and was bored for half of the movie, I'm kind of disappointed at this point, but, the last hour saved it, in my opinion. The moment when oppie and his crew started building the atomic bomb, things got interesting. The movie idea was very cool, people say that most don't really understand the film, but, it is in fact hard to understand it, but in the end, I did catch the idea of how they were building it. By far, not the best movie Christopher Nolan has ever made, but, it's there, I give it a solid 7, not bad, but not too great. Kinda disappointed, I was very hyped too see this movie, but it kinda screw me over at the beginning."
"With the horribly boring special effects and the stupid shuttering noises movie after movie, you think the director would try something new after all these years. The story is interesting enough but it amazes me that they put so much rubbish into the film. From the idiotic quasi-sex scenes to the over-saturated but oversimplified scholarly talk, the director lost a moment to provide an accurate and fully matured documentary and instead gives us
THREE HOURS of absolute boredom. Really don't understand how people rate this so highly. The amount of money they dump into Hollywood these days is sad."
"It's possible that this movie could win an Oscar. The subject matter impressed me, and on the whole, it was a great film. However, I did have a problem with the explicit sex scenes. It bothered me more than other things, even if some people might not think it's a big deal.Honestly, I didn't expect Christopher Nolan to include such explicit content in the movie. It surprised me because I know he usually makes intense and thought-provoking films, but this was unexpected. I think it's not appropriate for younger audiences, and the movie should have been given an 18+ rating instead of 13+.I wonder if the filmmakers are trying to normalize such scenes in public by including them in a movie for 13+ age group. It's a concern because it might influence young viewers inappropriately. I believe it's crucial to consider the impact of such content on impressionable minds."
"Over produced, but I'm sure people will love it anyway because they think they should. I love Nolan's work, so just disappointed.This could have been shot on 35mm and still been the same film from certain vantage points. I went into this with expectations quite high granted, but from shot composition to narrative structure there was nothing new here, a loud score with moments of sheer jump factor doesn't keep me entertained, when the film itself just felt completely lacklustre. I didn't feel any emotion translated across and considering the gravitas of the atomic bomb, it felt small, even in imax. Nolan is better than this."
"Unnecessarily timelines (that in memento were reasonable), too much presence of scientists (should have subtitles scientists name in their appearances)i think most viewers were from science background, they could have been comfortable if scientists name appeared as subtitles , background music was as expected, enjoyed it to fullest,cillian murphy is at his best. I expected Hiroshima scene ,should have been in to add some emotions, christopher need to learn a lot from Rajamouli in adding emotions,frankly speaking those who are admiring the movie are not rating honestly, half of viewers were leaving out in half time."
"It's so terrible and doesn't get better with time...Such a disappointment from Nolan. They could've made it much much shorter because the movie is sooo slow. The dialogues are so cringey and bad. The only good thing about this movie is cinematography. The acting is okay but since the whole plot of the movie is really bad it oftentimes comes off as cringey. I really recommend you not to watch this movie because you will only waste your money and time but also your IQ level. There are many unnecessary nudity and sex scenes as well. I was really looking forward to this, so I am very sad to write this."
"Emily Blunt acted overly vexated throughout, Robert Downey Jr was not able to deal with the subtle changes in his character later in the movie and ultimately he became dastardly and laughable, Florence Pugh deserved better and spent 60% of her 5 minutes screen time with no clothes on including a bizarre scene where she and Murphy are naked sitting opposite each other on arm chairs (as one does..), going all austin powers and covering their private parts strategically, Matt Damon was not terrible but I found him unconvincing (especially his delivery of '.. this is the biggest thing to ever happen in the history of the world!!' was most disappointing), Casey Affleck acted like he was an imperial officer in a Star Wars movieOne of the few people who surprised me was Josh Hartnett who I did not expect much from but who I thought was pretty solid. Cillian Murphy didn't surprise me at all since he was awesome as expected. Some of the younger cast were also quite good, but with a main cast like that I totally get why Murphy stayed in his hotel room and ordered uber eatsOtherwise few surprises.. predictable ever present atonal music all over the place which made sense in Dunkirk for example but not in this much more talky and narrative driven movie. Quite predictable sound design which was largely ear abuse (I wore ear plugs in the theatre and still it was too loud); crazy loud resonant dialogue all over the place, and token silent bomb detonation scene with jump scare after effect, and other random extremely loud Sauron style bass sections spread throughout the movie. The subtle elements were more interesting eg. The Foley and breaths during the bomb blast and I hope the mix for home consumption is better as was the case with Dunkirk for exampleThe nuclear detonation scene was underwhelming and needed more time, and I'll take David Lynch's version any day. Also Chernobyl was far more interesting in meshing sound and music for tension buildingA deeper movie would have been nice too, eg. More science instead of distant formulas on a chalk board, and more about his philosophical side would have given the movie more depth, instead of the legal focus and losing his security clearance etc which I'm quite sure Oppenheimer did not care about.Not a terrible movie by any means but I had higher expectations for this one. Cillian deserves to win awards for his performance, though he does not strike me as someone who gives a toss about those, maybe a bit like Oppenheimer.."
"The movie was very confusing because of two facts:
it was jumping back and forth in the timeline, God knows how many instances of time they used, some they threethey used confusing loud earthquake like sounds a couple of times in the movie just because ... well, couldn't figureI wanted to know more about the development of the bomb but that played only a side note.The focus was more on Oppenheimers political past, his love stories and that his one love couldn't stand to receive flowers.And I couldn't figure why nobody was hurt during the test-blast... it wasn't explained. Actually that was the most exciting point of the movie."
"Well played by actors, ruined by the constant sound and music, let me tell you that i had a headache after the movie.Constant jumping between past and future, litterally every 5 minutes is just too much for me.Good sides:
you can learn something from such movies.well played by actorsbeautefully shot3 hours long is plus for me.The bad side:
the music can drive you crazy, it is alwyas a sound in the background for the whole 3 hours.CHAOTIC PRESENTED.Somehow politically correct?!?!Overall good movie, but the way that is presented can give you headache, especially if you are in the cinema."
"I thought the movie was overall okay, obviously the cinematography was beautiful and the acting was great. I think the film was a bit ambitious and honestly way over-hyped. There were a lot of story lines that seemed unnecessary to include and definitely could've been shortened down. It was a little hard to follow at some points, and they mumbled a lot with very background music that was louder than the dialogue so sometimes I got lost, everyone in my group had the same complaint. The actual bomb scene as well was just extremely overhyped; that was probably the quietest part of the movie. Cillian Murphy did a great job. Some characters also just very random. It was almost like having a million little 15 second cameos of big faces. Lot's of unnecessary parts. Overall, though it was decent."
"There's much that's praiseworthy of this movie. Illuminating a key, forgotten figure whose brilliance helped end WWII, exploring his very human side, and reminding us of the damage wrought by the McCarthy hearings, all good. The fears the physicists had, that the atom bomb would ignite the atmosphere and burn the world, and then their very real horror of what they'd wrought, also good. The context, established so well in Matt Damon's general, that the American people (as well as the other allies) were desperate to end the war, is made clear. The effects are all that you expect from modern moviemaking.So, the downside. The storyline is the investigation over whether or not to renew Oppenheimer's security clearance in the fifties, which is biased by competing scientists egos, by Oppenheimer's interest in Communism, in the Spanish Civil War, begets repetition. The last twenty or so minutes could be edited to five. So many well known actors pop up in bit parts it's hard to know who to keep track of. Cillian Murphy well portrays Oppenheimer, a deeply conflicted man who built the bomb, and actively planned where best to drop it, then was tortured by his choices until he was stripped of his clearance, effectively retiring him. Robert Downey Jr might have a best support nom, if the tedious hearing scenes don't under cut him.The soundtrack is godawful loud and sometimes obliterates the dialogue. There are clever art house bits here and there, and they detonate the test well, but avoid the bombing of Japan. Interesting choices. If this movie were cut down by thirty minutes, it might be great."
"Oppenheimer is a visually stunning but ultimately unsatisfying film. The film's non-linear narrative is confusing and disorienting, and the film fails to explore the human cost of the atomic bomb. Fans of Christopher Nolan's work may find something to enjoy, but the film is unlikely to appeal to a wider audience. Literally it should be ban. Just telling about comments story of making a atomic bomb. And that thing kill millions of innocent people. This movie make no sense.Here are some specific criticisms of the film:The film is too long and slow-paced.The non-linear narrative is confusing and disorienting.The supporting performances are uneven.The film fails to explore the human cost of the atomic bomb."
"The movie barely represents the Hiroshima and Nagasaki drama. Being at Hiroshima and visiting the museum I was shocked to see some depictions with the aftermath of such a horrendous act.Briefly showing the internal struggle in Oppenheimer's head regarding the morality of it and focusing more on the politics and on the romanticized meetings is unacceptable. For sure, Oppenheimer had nightmares about the bombs, but instead we are seeing some flashbacks and a carbonized body. That is it! Nothing else.Half of the movie is pointless, nobody cares about how Oppenheimer was discredited in the public for being a spy or that his clearance was dropped. Everybody cares about the horror of creating and using of such an absurdly overpowered weapon."
"Aside from the sound design which was good, nothing here was really revolutionary. The mere length and drawn out dialogue made this film a snooze fest; the last time I wanted to leave the theater or just close my eyes was at the showing of the latest Matrix.Additionally, complex details of insignificance and multiple characters/ name dropping make it hard to follow for the average viewer unless you are already well versed on the backstory.Lastly, many scenes, in particular of the non-PG variety could have been cut out as they did not add to the story and wasted time.I would not suggest going out of your way to see this film. With 3 hours of a viewer's attention, you should walk away with something."
"The volume in the Imax was set so high i missed half the dialogue, especially the mumbly Oppy. If he had much of importance to say I missed it and it made following the jumping about in time even harder to follow. EXCEPT Matt Damon. His enunciation is clear as a bell. He knows how to speak. Wish other actors had been to the same school. It is probably a much better film than i experienced, the visuals are stunning and ther is some science mingled with the human stories. So, disappointed. It would be so easy for directors to ensure their films are audible and for actors to address their audience."
"Here are some points to consider that also includes some spoilers.Toned down explosion where no one even seemed concerned about the potential effects. It also includes absolutely no build up to the point the bomb explodes. No tension on the outcome of the explosion or the ""morality"" of what was built. If you are going to brag there was no cgi used for explosions at least have more than one and make one of them big and some what threatening.Oppenheimer is loyal to his country but not to his women and takes advantage of a woman with a mental illness. He is loyal to his wife to the extent to excuse poor behavior such as drinking instead of caring for the baby.It's really hard to have any sympathy for a man who has no moral compasss for himself and then in the end wants to interject his beliefs of the right thing to do. At the very least make his past discretions and growth part of the story of redemption but no redemption was even hinted at. He never apologized to his wife. He never hesitated. He never came back on screen to address his abandoned son.This was just a biography on an a-hole who continued down that path with help and support of his friends and family. This could have been summarized in 90 minutes instead of 3 hours. The effect would have been the same. This dude was a jerk and I really didn't believe he cared in the end about a nuclear arms race."
"It definitely didn't need to run for 3 hours but for the most part, I was really impressed by this film. I didn't find my mind wandering or thinking ""how much longer"", the storytelling pace was on point and gave you plenty of detail of how things developed for Oppenheimer. It was fascinating and the size of the cast and big names impressive. Maybe I missed something but it took 3 years to collect enough material to build the first bomb then suddenly after the successful detonation, 2 new bombs are ready to go. How? The film depicts the unfortunate outcome of working with Government, it's not about you but it's all about them."
"Great story. Great expectations . Awful cinematography. Badly told story. The interesting and important parts interrupted by endless awful music and loud pointless explosions and noises interrupting the dialog which would've made the movie good. To much going on at once in an uncontrolled chaos of epileptic visual display . The music for this movie was incredibly poor. Any part of the movie that I can think of , be that visual sound or story , was always eclipsed by unexplained chaotic take over by something else. If it's a story then music. If it's a scenery then epileptic display. Never thought I'll make it though. Bad experience."
"I'm an admirer of Nolan's movies. He casts or selects someone for his movie with utmost care, which he has done the same for this movie as well. Particularly C. Murphy, he is the best choice to play Oppenheimer's character. He lived in the character and has given his best. R. Downey & M. Damon were great supporting actors too. Nolan's display of Oppenheimer's life was spectacular and at times were outstanding. The bombing scenes or the trauma scenes or the flashback scenes, they were outstanding for sure.Coming to the negatives, the movie is not at all gripping. Most of his movies gives edge of the seat kind of experience namely Inception, Dark Knight series etc., but this one actually is not at all entertaining in fact it made me boring at times. I felt it like a documentary. I feel, Nolan's standards have gone down.Sorry this is in my opinion, but others might like the movie a lot or intact they might call it entertaining."
"A Film of 3 hours that somehow uses fast cuts the entire way through? Yep. Music all the way through? Yep. Just an overall loud soundtrack that had people put in earplugs around me? Yep. Let's just say it can be a little bit exhausting. At the same time, I can't help but feel like it could have been a better film had it been narrowed into 2 instead of 3 hours. It seems like it just contains too much information and overuse of dialogue to really keep you in your seat. Some of the characters just feel bland and emotionless. But maybe that's the way Nolan wanted it to be? That being said, it obviously has fantastic camera work, a great soundtrack and a couple minutes that were well done ( the speech scene and explosion). I just don't know if I could commit 3 hours of my life to watching it a second time..."
"For most part, the rendition of dialogue is finally improved in this film compared to the last few Nolan outings. We're not yet back at Memento or Prestige fidelity, though, in dialog or the rest of the film generally. Those were his seminal greats, in my opinion. Sorry, but even The Dark Knight was not a truly great film overall if you deleted Heath Ledger from it.Back to the rendition of voices, though, while most of Oppenheimer is fine, there are still a few too many scenes that are ludicrously mixed with the droning swath of the music obscuring them. There are some basic concepts in sound mixing, of keeping frequencies separated, volumes conservative for certain elements, or even panning the music to the back channels while the front is left for the voices that Nolan still refuses to adhere to enough.Combining the persistent occasional sound issues with the misuse of ADHD-style editing that Nolan first started abusing in the third act of Batman Begins, this montage-like, cutty speed where now even dramatic scenes of intimate dialogue and developing relationships are subject to this. Too much of the acting is drowned not only in the music & sound design but in this frenetic, impatient, abbreviated quality... for what, to shave 10 minutes off the total run time? Absurd. To improve the pacing and rhythm? It doesn't; exactly the opposite. It didn't work for the third act of Batman Begins' action & climax or his other films since, and certainly doesn't work for scenes of barely comprehensible dialogue in a romantic relationship. Let the performances breath, for crying out loud!It's not every scene, though, and as I previously said, there's more of Nolan's older films in this than many of his other recent films. Some segments of Oppenheimer were wonderfully edited, great sound, and the problems didn't destroy the rest of the movie for me. It's still definitely worth seeing. Heck, finally, one of my biggest pet peeves addressed: we've got a depiction of the speed of sound in film or TV. That's practically an historic moment. The Star Trek & Star Wars franchises, war films, and terrorism/spy genres take note!A few more caveats before I end this:It's too hard on Truman, who was portrayed better by Gary Sinise, anyway. Truman was duped by people around him who did not accurately & fully relay to him the prior peace overtures and terms of surrender the Japanese had offered, which required such things as their emperor remaining, which eventually were essentially accepted anyway after the detonations on two targets chosen for 1) having real humans to check the effects of the weapons on, and 2) to test on two geographically-distinct cities for future planning purposes. Truman was also not told that the Russians were positioning to assault the islands and the Japanese were desperate to surrender to the USA and not Russia. Truman later in his life admitted he'd been deceived by those around him in order to cause POTUS to make a decision his underlings wanted.The film is too easy on Teller, who had much more to do with the attack on Oppenheimer's character than is even shown here. Teller continued to have a deep connection to extremely sensitive and compartmented programs that he wanted Oppenheimer to have no connection to, and was instrumental in the assistance to the nation of Israel in the development of their thermonuclear weapons.Finally, and this is not a caveat but a defense of the film, the Hindu stuff needs to be put in proper context: life, death, pleasure, pain. The little death, as the French call it. Not to mention Hinduism did not notably become puritanical until it had to start competing with Islam in the region. In its early days, they had temples of prostitution, and the Kama Sutra is in fact a compilation of older Hindu 'holy' writings & instruction on sex."
"I dare to say what some people might want to say but darent.In my opinion a film that is around 3 hours long, with unnecessary prolonged female nudity, possibly to spice up a very long boring movie is very disappointing.Some lingerie would have done the trick and not made people feel uncomfortable being there with tbeir partners as was seen by the fidgeting and heard in the coughing.Not what I expected at all. My husband and I enjoy intellectual movies but this one was not easy or enjoyable. Confusing at times with different characters and jargon.People were fidgeting throughout the film.Trailers at 8.10 and got out at 11.35. Far far too late for a week night.Very very disappointedToo tired to write anymore."
"The movie isn't what I would call dramatic, but it does portray Oppenheimers life fairly accurately.And while I don't believe I'm giving a spoiler as this is history saying that Oppenheimers troubles post war were with his associations in the past with people who were communist or extreme left leaning during the McCarthy era, the movie brings out the fact he was guilty more of bad judgment than political sympathies.Even so I just changed it to ""it contain spoilers""Peggy Noonan wrote a great op-ed in the WSJ today on the movie saying that she wishes the movie had delved more into his reaction to the damage at Hiroshima.I believe that a movie of the immediate damage was classified until the early 70sI am giving my personal opinion here but based on what I have read, with the casualties at Okinawa, which was actually the first stage of the invasion plans to the island of Kyushu securing the airfield, that the bomb was necessary. Even with Nagasaki bombed it took the intervention of Hirohito to affect a surrender.Well I will not further delve into this but stay with the movie and it is true as the movie portrayed that a group of scientist tried to petition President Truman not to use itAnd it is true that before the test at Trinity there was actually some fear that the atomic reaction would burn the atmosphere completely around the world.My one criticism of it was the time they spent after Trinity delving into all of the investigations of Oppenheimer. To me any way it was all minutia and the movie would've been better served Shortly after Trinity (that was the first atomic test in New Mexico), as ending the movie with a few paragraphs explaining what was happening. 10 or 15 minutes of this minutia for me and I left the theater. I left the theater before the end but still enjoyed the movie.Which is a first for me.I thought Matt Damon even portrayed general Leslie Groves well. He's a pretty good actor going from Carroll Shelby to Leslie GrovesAnyway with the average of 8.7 on IMDb I gave it a ""7"" so I know my opinion is not shared by the majority but I am sharing it nevertheless."
"This is an extremely pathetic movie.... Christopher Nolan has lost his touch. Is he brain dead to show Bhagwad Gita in a sex scene. Do indians mean so less for Nolan in his mind?I hated every scene of the movie after going through that sex scene.In my mind he insulted 1.5 billions hindus around the world who follow the most ancient religion on Earth.The whole reason for me and my family to go and watch the movie of a World class killer Mr Oppenheimer whom Nolan has tried to portrayed like an ailing and suffering daughter in law under the Nazi type rule of Mr Strauss.Give us a break, he was a killer, nothing else...
But just it was a Nolan movie we went, but every one with a colonial mentality wants to earn from India by insulting India. Pathetic. Such a waste a money and time."
"Don't get me wrong, Christopher Nolan did a great job making this movie. It was a suspenseful, historically important movie. However, I am very disappointed that a movie that probably has cost a lot of money to make, did not even bother to check whether the Dutch (scene which was shot in Leiden) actually made sense. It was in fact, not Dutch, but German. This, especially considering that the timeline was during WW2, is shameful. WW2 was a difficult time for the Dutch, of which survivors, including my own grandma, are still alive. Older generations can take offence to this mistake, and it is just very sloppy."
"Story is slow, characters are randomly referred to by partial names at different points (randomly referred to by first same, or last name on it's own).Lots of boardroom / inquiry scenes that were just not really all that interesting.Watched in 70MM IMAX and I noticed the film artifacts a lot more than I noticed the much higher resolution.In our screening we had a weird blob about the size of an up close character's pupil in the middle of the screen for 1/3rd of the movie. It was super distractive.The massive resolution is also partially offset by the jaggedness of 24fps whenever anything moves.Not a big fan of the constantly swapping between aspect ratios / black and white and colour."
"A group of men in suits in different rooms arguing about the ethics surrounding the invention of the A bomb. The music, sound and absent of sound are marvellous depictions about the stresses of working on projects that are bigger than the ego. Yes the A bomb was awful and catastrophic but perhaps it served as a greater good invention required at the time. Was Oppenheimmer a good man? No one is truly good but just as in all businesses especially government, people can make you just as much as they can also break you. The symbolic ripples throughout, matched with the fast paced dialogue and glimpses of foreshadowing will leave you pondering did I just watch another rendition of Macbeth?"
"This movie is from start to end the most boring movie I have ever seen, there is no tension whatsoever. So many unnecessary scenes that dont add any value to the story, the tension towards the headlight of the movie "" THE BOMB "" I almost had to force myself to keep watching. When they tested the bomb ( after 2 hours of endless/boring conversations ) I was like "" thats it? "" I have seen bigger exploisons in a fast and furious movie. I thought come on this is not going to be THE EXPLOISON of the movie?! Atleast they are going to show the drop of the bomb on Hiroshima or Nagasaki?! NOOOOO just a radiomessage they dropped the bomb and it was a succes and Oppenheimer crying/nagging like a baby all the time. After the radiomessage I held on for about 10 min but left the theatre. Watching someone feed the ducks at your local park is more entertaining."
"I want to preface this review with the notion that only Christopher Nolan could turn a topic like this into a 3 hour work of art.The first two hours of Oppenheimer were simply incredible. Nolan has an amazing way of keeping an audience engaged while also keeping the suspense high. I throughly enjoyed the drama and thrills the first two hours brought with itThe reason this movie isn't a 8 or a 9 is the last hour. The scenes with RDJ were quite boring and didn't contribute to the topic (IN MY OPINION). I know the last scene with Albert Einstein is sort of the cherry on the top of the plot, but I didn't enjoy the dragged out court case. RDJ did great but his characters' historical importance is subliminal compared to the rest of the characters.Cillian Murphy played a perfect J Robert Oppenheimer. It's not easy to play one of the most intelligent men in modern history. One of the most prolific scenes was the end where you could feel the pain and resentment in Murphy's eyes. He was truly able to capture the toll the production of the bomb took on Oppenheimer's moral compass.Oppenheimer was an amazing theatrical experience. For me, I hold a Christopher Nolan movie to high standards given his past work. I think Nolan did as good of a job as he could given the subject matter at hand.10/10 would recommend watching, but I think a 7/10 rating fits this film."
This is a movie much more about politics and conspiracy than about the development of the nuclear bomb. The trailer is very misleading. The incessant music drowned out the dialogue and the non-chronological edits were very confusing. No charcter buildup. No emotion. A visually provocative biopic that seems less interested in character study. Hard to care about this movie. People and critics are saying they like this movie more than they do because they want to think of themselves as smart. Disappointed. This director is highly overrated and the false genius satus must have gone to his head.If you wanna see a good movie in the same genre watch the imitation game instead. Oppenheimer is not worth your time.
"Literally a three-hour documentary! The pace was quite good till the end of the Trinity test, which was shocking and exciting! However, the rest part I think it was just redundant! (Also because I almost can't hold up my pee so I can't really enjoy the latter half) Maybe Nolan thinks the later part was just echoing the right beginning, with due respect, I don't think so, to me it's just another hour's torture cause the rest of the plot is no longer hooking me and makes the ending chaotic. Yes, as the atoms and neutrons in an A-bomb would be, the 'great' Nolan adds his pacifist, anti-nuke ideology ingredients till he's done. I'm done, too."
Its only for people who understands and are seriously involved. If you want to watch a movie to relax or get entertained this is not such movie. That bomb scene is like 10 secs and whole drama is vey boring. Another disappointment of directors movie. Like the movie tenet what the hello is going on there...similar feeling... get to the point took looong and the drama feels like I watching a documentary. But Robert and Murphy were good especially in scenes towards the end. All the enthusiasm on watching the bomb scene lasted barely 10secs and is not even a big scene... It's like any other bomb in any other movie..
"The first half has very strong buildup to the big explosion, but the delivery is severely lacking. Just search images of 'nuclear explosion milliseconds' and see what wicked visuals and dramatics were possible. Instead, you could set a can of gasoline on fire, scale it up a bit and you'd get the same result as in the movie.The story was very interesting to me though, as I was not very familiar with Oppenheimer. It's a bit hard to keep track of the characters and timeline, but it's manageable.Personally not a favourite movie, but you should definitely see it sometime, because it's a important story laid out in a good movie."
"The movie was really bad.I think the only people that like this movie just are big nolan fans. This movie was so incredibly badly written it was hard to watch. The dialogue was so bland that you could not pick apart the characters. The timeline was dumb and did not add anything to the plot. The plot was not clear it was like they wanted to mostly talk about the bomb but ended using 70 percent of the movie to an uninteresting trial. The bomb was not a good climax it lacked the scale of a real atomic bomb. It looked like a flash bang with an gas explosion. They excluded the 2 bombs on Japan which are basicly the climax of the manhattan project and end of the war. Like how do you not include that. Really disappointing. Instead of calling it oppenheimer they should valled it ""is oppenheimer a commie?"". Absolute trash movie."
"Oppenheimer is very long movie. Certainly, while he (Oppenheimer) may have been cast in the media as central to the success of the Manhattan Project; clearly, it was a collective effort of scientists, not just one.Sadly, what is missing, unexplored in this dramatization, is the Japanese victims' perspective. We see, post WW2 uphoria, with Japan's surrender, in the American public eyes.I am not convinced this movie really comes to grips with the ignominy of the American political decision to use nuclear weapons on the Japanese general public. Rather, the story seems imbalanced. Surely, the key issue with nuclear weapons is not their power but their indiscriminate mass destructive capability. I'm not sure this victim orientated view is really given voice in this drama."
"This movie cramped too much story, even it's 3 hour run time is still not enough. It rushed every single scene with dialogues, dialoges, boom, moved on to the next scene, dialogues, next scene, boom, next scene, without letting the audience absorb or process the scene.It's like doing a marathon while holding an explosive diarrhea. This movie can't wait to see the finish line.Nolan should just focus the story about Oppenheimer and the bomb, leave the story about his communist past, his messy love life, his trial and that strauss rdj story. This is a movie not a documentary. Focus!Imagine if better filmmaker made this, like Paul Thomas Anderson, Scorsese, Coen bros or Dennis Villeneuve. They would focus the story and let the scenes breathe. Nolan is technically brilliant but he's just an artsy Michael bay. A noobie film snob favourite. People love to sniff his farts because it made them think they are snobby film connoisseurs."
"I've been a HUGE Christopher Nolan fan. Every movie he's made, Momento through Interstellar, I've loved. Flawed maybe, but loved them nonetheless. Movies that not only wow'ed me as a technical achievement, but moved me emotionally too. But lately...Nolan's films have taken a different trend. Stories that were once a perfect ratio of spectacle, plot, human drama and fascinating character work, have now been replaced with spectacle & plot-driven pieces devoid of character and heart.And Nolan's latest 3 hour historical epic, Oppenheimer is no exception. Mostly. Indulge me for a moment:Oppenheimer was of course competently written & directed, ie it hit all the historical story beats and had consistently great performances...but for me, the human touch was missing. The soul, if you will. To reiterate, It was a massive technical achievement: Great music, great cinematography, really unique tone. But that's mostly all it had to offer for me. And pair that with a grueling 3 hour run time, I have no desire to ever watch it again.Credit where credit is due, there are some excellent scenes. For instance: (slight spoiler alert, I guess? I mean, this all happened 80 years ago) The moment Oppenheimer gives his 'Victory' speech after the successful Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombing. The way they depict his inner turmoil and anxiety attack is beyond excellent. It's unique, it's heart-wrenching, it's beautiful. More of that, please.Additionally, I definitely loved what the movie had to say, it undoubtedly covered many profound ideas (though it'd be hard not to, due to the film's subject matter). HOWEVER, and this is my biggest critique...for a movie called ""Oppenheimer"" I never felt like we fully got into the headspace of our titular character. What was his true drive? What made him tick? (To clarify, Cillian Murphy's performance was phenomenal, this is only a dig at the writing).I think there's a great comparison to be made with The Imitation Game, the Benedict Cumberbatch-led WWII film from 2014). Our main character in that film, Alan Turing, is up against a near-parallel circumstance: a scientist/mathematician is hurled into a military setting he's not familiar with, to invent the world's first computer to decrypt German codes to help win the war before time runs out.But in The Imitation Game...I actually understand who Alan Turing is, and cared about him on a PERSONAL level. With both Alan Turing and Oppenheimer, I know they're doing what they're doing to WIN THE WAR. That's important. Obviously. But on TOP of that, in Imitation Game, I know what the task at hand means to him PERSONALLY. How he's been second-guessed his whole life, how much of an outcast he is. So if Alan Turing fails to invent the computer, not only do we possibly LOSE the war...but it's a PERSONAL loss. He's failed to prove himself in a world that's rejected him. And despite being a near-parallel storyline with Robert Oppenheimer, I didn't feel for him the way I should feel for a protagonist. And I'm confident all the historical ingredients were there. Just not utilized.Switching over to the external stakes: there was one core issue for me: Lack of urgency. During most of Oppenheimer's runtime, I nearly forgot WORLD WAR II was actively happening. Now I totally respect Nolan's decision to contain the story's perspective into one, small bubble. HOWEVER, it took away all the context for the WWII milestones that were occurring around the world! Excluding the marbles on the desk (reminding us about the enemy's plutonium supply), a few BREIF lines mentioned in passing, and one newspaper headline that said ""HITLER INVADES POLAND"", everything the enemy was doing during the war was out of sight, out of mind in this film. And because of this, I did not feel the urgency. I did not feel the stakes. Even though I knew, objectively, there was a TON of urgency, and a TON of stakes.... I didn't *feel* it. And that's the difference between a narrative story, and a history book. The audience shouldn't just logically understand something, they should feel it too.To play devil's advocate, because this film is a retelling of real historic events, it might not need to hit the audience over the head with those things to the degree I'm arguing for for. Most people are familiar with the events of WWII, so dropping a little blurb every now and then is often more than enough. But for me? Didn't cut it.Lastly, There were a lot of weird, borderline lazy instances of character intros and drops. The most egregious example being the character Rami Malek played (David Hill). The character was so subtly introduced in the briefest of scenes, then ended up becoming THE GUY who saves Oppenheimer during his final trial. And THEN, no follow up as to why. Maybe that was historically accurate? But unsatisfying and unresolved in the context of a narrative.All in all, these culminations of problems went up against my overall enjoyment of the film, then exasperated TENFOLD with its 3 hour runtime. Which is why Oppenheimer for me earns an underwhelming 6.9 out of 10."
"There are two types of biographical films that can be made: one is a dry, realistic history lesson, and the other is a more exciting, though somewhat fictionalized, biographically inspired story. Oppenheimer is the worst combination of these two films. Based on the story, he is much more like Icarus than Prometheus, as he rose so high in his scientific career only to be burnt in political struggles.Unfortunately, it lacks everything that sets Nolan apart from other directors: the psychological game, symbolism, narrative symmetry, visual aesthetics, and dream-like cinematic experience. It's a typical creation that tries to compensate for its weaknesses with a star-studded cast. Even after three hours, we can't grasp the character, but at least we learn that nuclear weapons can destroy the entire planet. Who would have thought?"
"Acting, editing, writing, pacing, and character study are all top notch, and when the final scene arrived, it solidified its' status as one of the greatest biopics of all time.The ramifications and discussion are endless with the parallels between not only arms races with WMD's, but obviously also AI and how the current dabblers in AI are also leading to the destruction of not only hundreds of thousands of people, but now millions or billions. Just like the A-bomb, current AI workers are dabbling in perhaps even more catastrophe and destruction of lives and worlds, yet we know they will not wake up to it because they need a job, want to succeed financially like Oppenheimer, and want to pay their bills. Yet, their work, along with the Super, will inevitably lead to the extinction of humanity.Nolan has created a biopic timely masterpiece that many people cannot comprehend. And Einstein's appearance along with Teller, Heisenberg, and Bohr- chef's kiss.Nolan hasn't been this detailed and meticulous since Memento. Expect Nolan to take home Best Director and Murphy to win Best Actor at the Oscars next year.7/10."
"I watched this 3 hour long movie which was mostly dialogue based with some very stunning cinematic moments. I felt the last hour was a stretch that could've been wrapped in half the time. Obviously the movie is relevant to regions of the world that were involved in WWII and revolves around an American figure who was able to produce the atomic bomb in remarkably record time. The controversies that surround his carrier and personal life was the center of this movie. I walked out feeling not being able to relate to most of it, except for the impact of his discovery on the nuclear proliferation in our current times.Not worth the 3 hours of watch in a theatre."
"Oppenheimer is a very typical Christopher film in that it features many of his routine trademarks, strengths, and weaknesses. It has the loud, intense score and sound design that he is known for, which I found effective here. It has beautiful production design and cinematography. It has a wonderful and very deep cast. Cillian Murphy is fantastic. However, that wonderful and very deep cast includes very few women, and Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh are largely wasted.Oppenheimer isn't so much a history lesson as it is a portrait of the man. Yet in that regard, it still feels incomplete. Some aspects of his life seem quite clear: we can see that he is an engaging teacher and leader. However, the film doesn't really explore his personal relationships. Throughout the film, we are told that Oppenheimer's important personal relationships include Jean (Florence Pugh), Kitty (Emily Blunt), and his brother Frank (Dylan Arnold), but we are never really shown anything meaningful about them. In particular, we are never shown anything that illustrates why Oppenheimer is in love with Jean and Kitty. They were two very intelligent, complex, and interesting women, and it's disappointing that they are given so little to do. Additionally, you never see him actually interact with either of his children.In part, this movie is about the internal conflict caused by creating such a powerful weapon. In one sequence, Oppenheimer has a vision of people affected by the atomic bombs. Christopher Nolan's daughter has a cameo as a young woman whose skin is peeling off her face. Nolan explained the casting decision saying ""...if you create the ultimate destructive power it will also destroy those who are near and dear to you. I suppose this was my way of expressing that in what, to me, were the strongest possible terms."" However, Oppenheimer never seems to have that moment for himself. This destruction is never reflected back onto the people he loves. The people he sees in his visions are strangers.The film has so many really wonderful elements and some powerful sequences, but I found that the avoidance of his personal life left a gaping hole. Even though it's a three-hour movie (with good pacing), it still only scratches the surface.I do feel like this is a movie best seen in a theatre, largely due to the sound design. It's hard to recreate those big rumbling sounds and powerful silences at home."
"Unfortunately for me this film was a total failure.I can't fault the actors who mostly do a good job (apart from RDJ who despite the prosthetics never convinces that he is anyone expect RDJ.) The blame here lies solely with Nolan who in his signature style creates an overlong, convoluted, poorly edited, tedious slog of a film.Although there are good scenes, they are a few and far between. Most are over in a matter of minutes and erratically jump to the next, sometimes spanning across multiple timelines, causing unnecessary confusion. We never spend enough time with any of the characters to learn much about them or form any kind of connection, thus leaving the film devoid of any kind of emotional impact.The main focus of the film is also on Oppenheimer's trial and communist connections post-war rather than the actual building and detonation of the bomb. A complete bait and switch from what was advertised to us. This would be fine if any of it was interesting but it's really not. It's dull as dishwater and it lasts for THREE HOURS.The score is too loud and overbearing, often drowning out the dialogue and not fitting in with the scene. Many have commented that the first 30 mins feel like an extended trailer, of which I agree. It really doesn't get much better after that.We actually left the cinema half an hour early because it had become completely intolerable at that point (having already contemplated leaving around 90 mins in). I should point out, I've been going the cinema for 25 odd years and I've only ever walked out on one other film. Can you hazard a guess as to what it was? Yep, Nolan's previous effort...Tenet.The mass praise and hysteria surrounding this is clearly unwarranted. It is a BAD movie no matter how you look at it, pure and simple. A snoozefest that will send even the worst insomniac to sleep. I'm astonished by all the positive reviews.After yet another dud, I personally will never see anything directed by Nolan again."
"It was ok... I learnt some history, however, with the hype and Nolan I expected more. This movie felt lacking in cinematic creativity. The scenes of Oppenheimer experiencing internal turmoil whilst holding a tough exterior were great. I really liked the editing and effects during this speech scene and was wanting much more of it. I also hoped for more from the sound design throughout. It had beautiful cinematography as expected and the story is interesting enough but I don't think it will be a rewatch. It definitely didn't blow me away.With the marketing I was also looking forward to more of Pugh's amazing acting but felt her character was severely underdeveloped, especially with how important her eventual demise was.Murphy did a fantastic job and I adored seeing David Krumholtz on the big screen. I do feel like the film was slightly over saturated with famous faces and Nolan's friends. It was often a fun surprise to recognise so many people but with such small roles being taken by big names, I would have liked some up and coming actors to have that opportunity. In saying that, Jack Quaid will always be my favourite nepo baby.Towards the end it felt less like Oppenheimer and more like Strauss, however RDJ did a fantastic Stanley Tucci rendition."
"I'm a movie buff. I love quality storytelling and Character development. This movie had none of these qualities. It was laden with music & sounds that were way too loud and completely distracting. Even to the point where, when you wanted to care about a character, you couldn't because the constant noise distracts. The acting and cinematography was good but if you don't know the story of Oppenheimer you will not understand. I recommend watching a biography of his life first so you can get a sense of what happened. This movie only touches on what actually happened. It's more of a courtroom drama.."
"I wanna start this review by warning you: the movie is long; there are long scenes of silence, contemplation and instrospection. A person who's not used to watching slow movies can still enjoy it, but there are plenty of senes that added very little and coulda been trimmed to make the movie shorter and more emphatic.My second complain is the over indulgence on Hans Zimmer's grandiose composition. This is not exactly a bombastic movie, yet there are at least 3 montage which do no progress the plot or show any substantial development on the charactersand are clearly there just to insert Zimmer's music. I found that very off putting. This isn't Inception or Interstellar where the music compliments the spectacle and creativity of the scene.This is still an awesome movie. Of special note is Robert Downey Jr.: The man can act. This is the very first time I see him actually act in a movie and he was great! The whole supporting cast is so good. A lot of known faces and other not so well known giving excellent performances. I'd like to also give credit to Emily Blunt, reminding us why she's such a household name.For the most part, this is a courtroom drama, but the little ""action"" there is in this movie, you'll get your money's worth of ""Nolan"". There's one particular scene where I felt really immerse and even started getting anxious to see what came next, the whole room felt it too! At that moment you are right there by Openheimmer's side hoping for the best. That was an awesome movie experience.Don't let my criticism fool you into thinking this is a bad movie. This was still the best cinematic experience I've had in the past 3 years. I just wished these little complains could be improved and turn this into a 10/10 movie."
The trailer and promotions of the movie seem to be about Manhattan project but on contrary it has too many sub plots pre and post Manhattan project. The political drama aspect explored in the movie remain very superficial and don't really grip the viewer.The viewer need to have knowledge of the political environment of 1950s in the USA. The movie doesn't give background before describing the events that occur during McCarthy era.There was also not much in the movie for big screens and iMax. The movie is more an abstract autobiography of Dr Oppenheimer.It is one time watch movie on the OTT and fell short of movies associated with Christopher Nolan.
"I am a big Christopher Nolan fan and went to see Oppenheimer with great enthusiasm. The marketing campaign presented the movie as something innovative, something you should definitely see on IMAX to get unforgettable emotions, but unfortunately the movie didn't live up to my expectations. The movie is good, not a bad plot, very good performance of actors. But going to the movie by CRISTOPHER NOLAN, you expect more than 3 hours of dialogues to a tense melody and 1-minute scene of the ""Test"" atomic bomb explosion.Objectively speaking, the film is not bad.But subjectively - not the kind of film that you want to watch over and over again, like Interstellar, Inception or Tenet. In terms of cinematography, I didn't see anything new, and it's hard to come up with a beautiful picture when the setting is a small room with 5-6 people talking continuously.My verdict, if anyone is interested, is 7/10, for a good story, editing, and excellent acting."
"Much like in Interstellar, at the most crucial moment Nolan's movie is fully dependent on false realities (station axis of rotation, not the black hole). In Oppenheimer they had not found any story with flesh in it, unless they did the following:1. Every physics scene is picked to only lead the viewer to think about Doom's Day2. Strauss is a villain. But not only that, the movie claims he is a villain that got played good by the hero Oppie. As everything in both the main interrogations and their results is about him preventing the Doom's Day. Successfully, although nothing worked, did it.3. Every other governmental career event that would show other methods of handling H-bomb matters, or with other people than Strauss, is not shown.4. They did not mention in any way that when Strauss wanted to block the trade of the so called 'isotopes', with other countries, that theese are medical imaging isotopes. Which do not form any part of a nuclear device, fission or fusion. This way it seemed that also on that day Oppenheimer was in work only to affect the superweapon balance of the world. In which Strauss was his main opponent.(Actually they also changed the original statement Oppenheimer made to the senate. Original ended mentioning vitamins, or another health product.)5. David Hill's hearing is shown as the pivoting point in Strauss' career. Script is doing everything to lead up to this moment by claiming that Strauss was always worried about 'who is the physicist' coming here. Hill is such a far-on-the-side character that he is just an extension of the Oppenheimer-blast-zone. In real life, he said particular words about the man in the other man's trial, but in the movie we watch it with the idea that he talks about what we know, about all the backstabbing.6. I don't know anything about Oppenheimer, but I read somewhere that we did not get the real person at all when it comes to his thoughts and solutions at specific moments of time. Or his skills with people and so forth.For some reason the movie shows that the hero's strength is in proportion to his visibility in media. Because it completely ignores the meaning of the politicians and government workers of all time who are in support of him, for say rational reasons. There's also somekind of a shroud over why after his defeat Oppenheimer wasn't active in academia. The comparative discussion with Einstein seems out of place. Because he thinks he is talking about academy, when actually the winner of the Enrico Fermi Award is chosen, in its last phase, by the whim of a cabinet member and then by the president.In general the movie has basic problems when it focuses on the communist trials. But every kind of viewer can tell from the start there is no trial mystery whatsoever. Main character is not expressing himself in a concrete manner and it looks like they avoid letting him show anything about himself. Even if we think the expressed man should be the thing in the above numbers, there is very little. Instead there are plenty hallucination, or that kind of, scenes that should tell us what kind of a person Oppenheimer is (not to mention what kind of a person everyone else is). Also we get to see more Oppenheimer's feelings after a personal loss, than in the job. I'm not saying that covering it differently would have been simple, and it would turn him into a complicated character (where the way it comes out, as exact dialogue or his reactions, you should have written as a fiction. Based on what you think a person that is actually like the Oppenheimer from historical record would be like).I would have made a more in-depth Manhattan Project movie, with different people's point of views. To make fiction there should be something (else) writen about why he got the Project. Would have also made a Trinity test from many camera angles and different slow motions, where for example the desert sand jumps up 10 feet and buries this camera. The Bomb itself seemed small even in a theatre. You need to push the camera right into it. When someone is listening to it or something.Rating is the lowest possible because, what I recall, the feature doesn't start with a 'some scenes are fictionalized for a dramatic effect' -warning."
"Oppenheimer is a film that boasts amazing directing and clean visuals. Cillian Murphy delivers an amazing performance, one that truly deserves an Oscar. The dialogues of the movie are particularly noteworthy.However, the film is not without its flaws. The use of black and white shots doesn't seem to add much to the story, and the fast-moving timeline can be difficult to follow. It might have been more effective if the story was told year by year, with the trial and future scenes in black and white for better understanding.Additionally, while all of Nolan's films come with high expectations, Oppenheimer doesn't quite live up to them - with the exception of Interstellar.Overall, it's still a film worth watching for its amazing visuals and Cillian Murphy performance."
"I simply can't like this movie. It wants to say way too much and says way too little about way too many things. It can't decide what it wants to be, so it's not really anything - not just for the viewer, but for the creator. And that's a problem. It's not good as a biopic: there are serious historical flaws in the story, which irritated me. I'm a huge fan of John von Neumann... anyone, who knows who he was understands why I mention him. As a drama? The movie can't decide the centre of the drama. It's too weak as a spy-story, too weak as a political drama, too weak as a personal drama. Not one aspect is worked out to carry the film. The strongest aspect was how many times in american history the ""what you did 20 years ago is more important than who you become and what your expertese is"" ruined people's lives. Or at least was used as a political rethoric against opponents. And I appreciated that, hence the 5 points. As a moral/personal evolution the moral conflict isn't built up, the ""evolution of a scientist"" dies away halfway and doesn't really connect with the ""organizer scientist"". The ""science should or should not have moral boundaries"" isn't worked out and built up, just comes and goes without a purpose. The only detactable personal evolution is the ""man of future becomes the man of past"", but somehow that remains too weak in the end, too. So the movie falls apart and not even the brilliant actors and the massively impressive explosion scene can hold it together.I couldn't help feeling how Nolan this time couldn't feel the fine line of balance... that ""sometimes less is more""."
"Saw Oppenheimer last night! It was a lot to unpack so I'll try to be super direct:
1. The acting! Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey, Jr. And Emily Blunt will ALL get Oscar nominations, and may even win. This was by far Cillian Murphy's best performance, you can tell he dove into this character and really did his best and it shows. Robert Downey Jr. Played his character Lewis Strauss as well as he played Iron Man honestly. Emily Blunt played the extremely rough bitter wife and that was some of her best work I've ever seen her do. Even Matt Damon did great as well.2. I think this is the first time I've ever watched a Christopher Nolan movie where it had absolutely no action for three hours, really the only action moment was the bomb going off and that lasted for maybe five minutes. Disappointed that the biggest moment was not long enough for all the hype it was. It was amazing though.3. WAY too long. Like I said the fact that it had no action made the three hours really last. Movie could've been shortened by probably at least 30 minutes.4. Random nudity and sex. There were two scenes that had nudity/sex, one was maybe a minute, the other was maybe five minutes. Lots of boobs. Maybe it was trying to keep people entertained? I don't know but it was pointless and really random. Would have been better off removed so that it could've been PG-13 so millions of more people could've watched it. My sister and I actually had to go to the bathroom and missed the second five minute scene, perfect timing! Lol
5. Other than maybe Interstellar, this was hands-down, the best sound I've ever heard in a movie. It will win at the Oscars as well as every award show. It was absolutely amazing the sound of the score combined with the sound of brief moments you see containing explosions.It definitely is a well-made Chris Nolan movie, the guy doesn't know how to make a bad movie. It's not one that you would watch over and over again like Inception, Interstellar or the Dark Knight trilogy, but more like Dunkirk. Once in a while, where you can have the remote in your hand to fast forward, some of the extremely long dialogue and brief slutty scenes and turn on subtitles."
"You will get a 3-hour movie that is not entertaining, not edifying, and not intellectually informative. The plot can be summarized in less than 5 minutes, therefore, you will get a lot of filling time when nothing really happens. Half o the movie is a combination of a boring meeting that never ends - you get one of these every day at work - and a mock trial. Moreover, add to it a lack of intellectual depth in all the conversations. The movie really misses the mark on all the aspects of plot/action, a shallow to no conversation/dialog between actors, unmoving/ordinary scenes, and a lack of character development. Add to it a continuous annoying sound that is meant to fill in stridently for the lack of emotion because the movie never gets going. If you don't like it, don't be afraid to recognize it because there is almost nothing to like. My recommendation is not to spend the time."
This movie was HUGE on dialog and nowhere near enough real action. Probably afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. The layer of music over top of the voice track was too much and made for too many missed words. All along I kept wishing for closed captioning so I could follow the story. For a 3 hour movie I completely expected more action. Sound decibel level was impressively loud. I expect some cinema grade loudspeakers got blown and probably startled a few Barbie movie goers in the theater next door. Time will tell if this was a hit. Might catch more streaming views so we can follow all the spoken words.
"This film should not exist: bad storytelling, awful casting and boring concept. I have a degree in physics and I like long deep movies, but this movie is nonsense. Story could be told in 15 mins, not 3 hours. Wasted my time on 50 identical man in old hats arguing about nothing in desert. It is like a bad documentary. How did you spend that amount money on this? Maybe if you are a fan of Oppenheimer's life, you can find this movie interesting. And everybody from the movie crew is faking successful start - I am sure all of them are laughing at the audience who have to watch this movie for 3 hours. And I wish Christofer Nolan good luck on the next episode - ""Oppenheimer 2: Oppy cannot decide what sauce to buy in supermarket"" - it could be 4 hours. And ""Oppenheimer 3: Oppy arguing with his neighbours"" - ideally for 5 hours. Peace for all - I don't want to start a nuclear war in comments - just dropping a little thing :)"
"I'm not an action junkie, i said Schindler's list was good. But i asked once again? What is the real struggle in oppenheimer's life? Because he made the trouble himself. His womanizer behaviour, he makes fun of strauss making strauss framed Him. He's making a bomb that could kill millions of life but then regret doing so?When i watched this movie, all i think is ""oh God, when will this unimportant drama ends? "". I thought this movie will end when America dropping bomb to Japan but no, all i see until The end of the movie was the hyperbolation of not so interesting life of an oppenheimer.And Nolan, you don't need a sudden high volume sound to demonstrate the "" Experiment"" or the ""theories"". You already get the point across. Or is this is an attempt from you to wake up the people who's sleeping on this movie? This movie is equivalent of watching tall girls on Netflix, both of the MC don't have a life struggle worth picked on the Big screen.My conclusion is, just like President Truman said, Oppenheimer is a crybaby. And so is Nolan, who picked an uninteresting life of an oppenheimer."
Everybody is pressured to saying that Christopher Nolan movies are great. Same happens for this one too. I had to sit through 3hrs of boredom and agony trying to figure out what this is all about.Average population is used to linear story telling and this movie made it so complicated to follow along. First 45 minutes was clueless. Last 45 minutes was politics. Somewhere in between they made a A-bomb.That's all I can say about this one. You have to follow the dialogues so closely to make any sense of it.A good percentage of reviewers are forced to give a high rating because they feel pressured to express their true opinion.Average movie goer is not going to understand the high rating of this movie nor the movie.
"Why IMAX? Contrary to all of the previous Christopher Nolan films that managed to deliver intelligent stories and visual spectacle at the same time, there is nothing visually spectacular to behold here, yet they are announcing this as the ""must see in IMAX experience"". The movie is a political drama of people talking in rooms that has too many gratuitous nudity but almost nothing of The BOMB in action, which is what most people expect to watch on the giant screen given its premise and because it's a Christopher Nolan movie after all, the marketing clearly exploits those factors.The other factor going against the movie is its rating. The movie is R rated; a rating that could have been used to justify the showing of the destruction and horrors of the bomb that people expected to watch, specially during the scenes when Oppenheimer imagines them; just like Terminator 2 managed to do it splendidly over 30 years ago, but instead it is used to show those unnecessary sex scenes that could have been removed in order to get a PG-13 rating and sell more tickets to profit from the IMAX expense. I have heard that they decided to not be explicit on such destruction and horrors in order to ""not offend anyone on the audience"". Sorry, but it's a movie about making a bomb, that's what bombs do, create horror and destruction, and the movie clearly knows it, it's very well explained in its dialogue but it decides not to show it. When you choose to make a movie about such sensitive topic it is already too late to care about offending someone, everyone who is going to watch it already know what they are getting into anyway, so why not to remain objective and go all they way showing what you are supposed to show in a movie about ""Oppenheimer""? Spielberg knew what to show and what not to show in ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", both deal with sensitive topics and fulfilled audience and critics expectations.Talking about Spielberg, this movie it's like if ""Jurassic Park"" focused on the creation of the dinosaurs and the people who created them, they hatched, then the movie jumps in time until people return from the island and talk about what happened when the dinosaurs escaped, instead of showing us.""Show don't tell"", Nolan and Spielberg were great at it.Would that ""Jurassic Park"" version be interesting? Yes, but if you care more about genetics than entertainment, just as Oppenheimer is interesting if you care more about physics and politics, which is not many people among the general audience.But the movie was shot on IMAX, so it's clearly intended to the general audience but what is shown on it doesn't justify its IMAX format, and is R rated.So who was this movie for?The movie is long and there is not enough spectacle to keep the interest of general audience that come to see the explosion.It is also too expensive to have been made just to please a small audience that only cares about the politics behind the bomb creation.Christopher Nolan could have find the right balance to satisfy both audiences, he proved he can do it for almost 20 years in a row, but he had to eventually fail at some point, this is that point.It worries me the box office of this movie will put IMAX and film in general in a bigger risk of disappearing. It was meant to be the one to standardize it and Nolan was the one who knew how to do it the best.So in conclusion... Is the movie bad? No, but is definitively a lot less of what everyone is expecting when they see the words ""Nolan"" and ""Oppenheimer"" together."
"Yes, it is a very average movie but hyped by the audience. Nolan fans have rated movie very well because they experienced the placebo effect. The movie is nothing special. I must acknowledge that the acting of every actor in the movie is top-notch. What I felt was bad, is the way storyline was presented; nothing creative was tried. Also, the movie is very dialogue intensive. At the end of the movie, I just felt that a lot of facts were poured into my head. Direction is slightly above average. From the perspective of students persuing science in graduation, the movie doesn't have much part of science; they could have showed how great Oppenheimer was in terms of his academic achievements and what all he did, instead, they choose to just say in a one-liner through dialogues!!!"
"Murphy is excellent and will obviously be nominated..rest of cast are also very good ...However movie is abit too long and a bit too melodramatic for its own good .Several sections of film could have been ""excised"" or at least shortened..I wont describe them but they are obvious ...Jump cuts ( im not sure what to call them) are distracting and
create some confusion ( some other viewers felt same ) .The focus on building bomb was interesting as was the attempt to ""railroad"" Oppenheimer.Typical Nolan ...over blown ... very noisy and hyperbolic...
However the ""message"" of film is well intended.Oppy was a very complex Man !"
"""Oppenheimer,"" Nolan's new film, is 4 stars maximum. And Cillian Murphy doesn't save the situation, only constantly widening his eyes in close-ups.It is a very difficult cinematic task - to film how people do science, so that there were no hackneyed formulas, sudden insights, complex gender relations and other banalities.And with Nolan, all these buffers follow one after another, and the result is a film about a typical conflict of professional ambitions in a closed research institute. In that sense, ""Nine Days of One Year"" rises head and shoulders above it.The only bright spot is Gary Oldman's two-minute role, in which he shows who is a great actor and who is not."
"Christopher Nolan per usual produces a great film. The sound design is mesmerizing and shocking, and he depicts the madness, moral turmoil and hypocrisy of a very dangerous, erratic genius extremely well, and with stunning cinematography.Cillian Murphy does a good job at playing Oppenheimer, although I felt like there was too much riding on the back of his performance, which made its imperfections more visible. This isn't really shade on Cillian because he is a great actor it feels more like a directing issue. Emily Blunt does a wonderful job as Kitty, she does a great job of conveying the role of a woman who has lived so many lives and is beside herself and holding people accountable, without simply coming off as hysterical.Similarly all the scientists are well depicted, even though these are comparatively minor roles I found their acting convincing and engaging.Regrettably this movie is way too long, and becomes fairly confusing as it covers 2 separate hearings in tandem, and huge sections of the film are in black and white for no clear reason. It feels much like two movies cut together, rather than a cohesive whole.There are 2 scenes containing nudity, one of which is a sex scene, neither of which really contribute to the plot in any way other than informing us of the fact that those people have a relationship. If I'm going to be in a movie for three hours I'd rather my time were better spent.The sound design also suffers from some of the common issues of modern films: characters often mumble, or their speech is drowned out by the backing track.This film is also missing major characters, for example Fermi is mentioned only in passing. Nothing of Germany or Russia's work is shown from the inside, although this isn't necessarily a bad thing, the film is very much fixated on the perspective of the Americans looking out onto the world stage, it's just worth mentioning that you won't really get a global view of things."
"One of the most excruciatingly boring films I have seen in a long time. No stakes, no dramatic tension, no investment in the characters. Just endless dry dialogue often overlaid with very loud music so it was hard to even hear what was being said a lot of the time. I fell asleep and was unfortunate enough to wake up again with still 2 of the 3 hours to go. If I hadn't been there with my family I would have left. Christopher Nolan seemed more intent on proving his own intelligence than being a good storyteller. The messing around with the chronology was an example of this, as for me it detracted from the story rather than enhancing it. A very important and potentially gripping subject but this film did not do it justice at all in my opinion."
"Well, I am spoiled with 'The animation game'. Compared to that movie I give 'Oppenheimer' a six. Oppenheimers character was not as sound displayed is Turings... Cracking the German code is also not so controversial as developing an atombomb... Mixed feelings.Somehow the English dramaturgic effects works better then the USA effects. The impossible love story in 'The animation game' was also more clear. The background everlasting dramatic music was a little overdone. Is it so hard to do something without music? The interrogation was complex, long and perhaps near to reality, but for me it made the movie unnecessaraly long."
"The film is a dull and tedious affair, with no sense of drama, emotion or insight. Nolan's direction is uninspired and bland, relying on clichés and exposition to tell a story that has been told better before. The cast is wasted, with no chemistry or charisma. The film is also too long, dragging on for nearly three hours, with no tension or excitement. People were literally sleeping in the hall, and I don't blame them. Oppenheimer is a disappointing and boring film that does not do justice to its subject or its audience. It is a waste of time and money. I give it one star out of five. I regret wasting my time."
"This is a mini-series treated as a 3-plus hour movie. The direction, special effects, scenery, and editing are great. But the movie bogs down early with tedious, boring dialogue, pretentious posturing and emotional sterility which bleaches any life out of it. This is a tale about the creation of the atom bomb treated like episodes of Days of Lives. Murphy is flat and two-dimensional as Oppenheimer, though he looks the part. He has two or three expressions which are over-used.. Robert Downey Jr. Easily walks off with the acting honors.The script veers of into scenes that are not essential to the story telling. The high point is the test at Los Alamos but the movie plows on for an hour move giving us chapter and verse about how Oppenheimer was later abused by people he trusted.The film is over-stuffed with characters you struggle to keep straight and bitty scenes that add little to your understanding. For all its length, Oppenheimer remains something of a mystery at the end.. There is no reason for this film to run over 3 hours. You will be checking your watch by the end."
"Looking at the review I was really excited to go and watch this movie.I shouldn't have bothered! So many historic fact missing, so did they not get radioactive effect from watching the explosion in the US of course they did never showed or mentioned, little mention of the impact on Hiroshima but no details, once again a film that portrays government has coward and need scapegoat to justify their actions, one question is how can you be Jewish and communist?Who cares about the love story and the cheating, it wasn't that relevant to the story.I had high expectations it didn't deliver I feel cheated."
I should not even mention anything about direction as we know the director and that's why we go and watch his movies. The story revolves around oppenheimers inner fight of need to create the bomb and guilt of after effects. He is passionate about what he is doing but after the test he goes to guilt and hence wants to stop the escalating and research on making more bombs. Please do not expect any mind boggling action and adventure from this movie. It does not even show how the actual bomb got dropped. Once the test was done the work got over for oppenheimer.I would however rate rocketry over this movie.I also am strongly against the sex scene having gita shlok and it should be removed immediately.
"Starts off quick and awkward. Very hard to figure out what timeline you are in, throughout the movie. Apparently the future is in B&W, Totally not necessary, just confusing. I kept thinking ""geez, we are not in your head, Christopher Nolan, get some details in order"" Watching the documentary on Peacock was more enjoyable, and explained a alot. I can't imagine seeing this movie without watching the documentary first. I would have been completely lost, with it I was just merely lost. Too many, way too many characters to keep straight. If I had to choose a best character actor, I'd go with Matt Damon, although his first spout if anger was a bit off. There is much more to Oppenheimer the man, than what is portrayed. If I was streaming this 3 hour movie, I wouldn't have finished it. As it is, 4 people walked out of the theater before the 2 hour mark. Save tour time and money, and watch the documentary on Peacock."
"Quite disappointed. Story and timeline were all over the place. If you have never hear of Oppenheimer, you are still quite lost because the story line missed connecting to the audience. Really felt like I wasted 3.5 hours on a nice Sunday afternoon.I'm really surprised that the story was missed so badly. I Mt feels like the writers strike had something to do with this but sadly it doesn't.What a great opportunity it was that was missed to bring some important history to those that have forgotten or were just unaware.Movie was 3 hours + the previews. It made it feel like I watched an old baseball game before the pitch clock."
"I have really liked all of Christopher Nolan's movies so far, but I guess that had to end sometime. This movie is dreadful. If you think Oppenheimer's atomic creation is the biggest bomb you've ever seen, this movie will prove you wrong.You know when you're at a lecture and someone in the audience puts up their hand and says, ""Well, when I was dining at Elton John's chateau in the Italian Riviera with Fran Lebowitz and Neil deGrasse Tyson ..."" and you instantly hate them? That's the kind of person who gives this movie a 10/10.In practically every scene, Nolan introduces a new character for you to not care about and forget by the next scene. There were so many characters, all referred to by last name only, I couldn't keep track.Also, the music is incessant! I'm all for movie music, but it doesn't need to be constant. Plus it was SO loud, sometimes you couldn't understand what the people on screen were saying. In fact, it was so loud and in your face that it kept waking up the couple sitting next to me.Save your money on this one. Watch it when it comes on TV - if you have insomnia you need cured.Contrary to the popular adage, I WOULD recommend this movie to my worst enemy."
"I love a Christopher Nolan film as much as the next fanboy and I was definitely intrigued. I haven't been this excited in a while that I purchased an Imax ticket months ahead of time. A 3 hours film length doesn't frighten me as long as the film flies by which only happens if a movie keeps you engaged the whole time. Unfortunately, I feel it was a little too long and should have ended soon after the atomic bomb was a success and Oppenheimer comes to grips with the powerful self-destruction creation he made. Instead Nolan chose to drone on about Oppenheimer's bureaucratic problems he encounters and beats a dead horse on the moral problems he comes to grip with. I felt it was answered enough in the previous 2.5 hours and I admit I was beginning to clock watch and wondering when it was gonna wrap up. All I can say is that Nolan is indeed the greatest director of this generation but peaked with Interstellar for me which was truly a top 10 film. That movie deserved multiple viewings with a similar runtime but keeps you engaged the whole time. This I feel comes up way short behind his other masterpieces such as Interstellar, Dark Knight, The Prestige, and Inception."
"This movie was LOUSY. The scenes were ALL too dark, as in not bright enough to see much. The sound was not always clear. There were way too many characters to keep track of. We didn't know who these people were supposed to be. The time that events took place was all jumbled up. There was much to much jumping back and forth in time. The characters all looked alike. The physics information was geared towards 2nd graders. Sex scene at the hearing? Why was there a need to show naked bodies out of context? There was no focus - The bomb story, the science, the wife and girlfriend relationships, the hearings, background stories, the communist angle, Los Alamos. Too much touching on something a little bit but not enough."
"I love most Nolan films including Tenet but Dunkirk left me disconnected resulting in a tedious experience. I much preferred Oppenheimer yet this emotional disconnect from the characters and plot was present at least to a lesser extent. The film is evidently meticulous in its production with outstanding acting yet it felt somewhat mechanical and disconnected amidst its pummelling of events. I was riveted by Dark Knight, Interstellar and Tenet yet Oppenheimer and Dunkirk far more so saw emotional resonance with the characters and care for the films outcome lacking. I've definitely had films belatedly connect with me on subsequent viewings, however, I am concerned personally with this and Dunkirk's style yet most including the Oscars are likely to say otherwise."
"The title speaks for itself. I was very much looking forward to this movie. It took only 45 minutes for me to be ready to walk out. The only reason I stayed was the hope for the movie to get better or at least progressively come close to expectations. What we got was a directors personal interpretation and failed attempt at ""art"" that became painful to witness. A confusing plot that even at the end gave little insight to what was trying to be portrayed. This film tried so hard to be the Citizen Kane of it's time. This attempt fell far short of everyone's expectations at the theater. A quarter of the movie was bearable and the rest, downright disappointing. The whole movie is fixated on telling a confusing story of 2 peoples perspectives of events along with a personal vendetta, and a kangaroo Court. Oh, and I think at one point they actually talked about making a nuclear bomb or something but that wasn't the main story line to what the film was about. At the end of the movie I heard a fellow moviegoer say ""What did I just watch"". This film took 3 hours of my life I will never get back, Although it's probably going to win an Oscar."
"The movie drags and drags until your last two brain cells stop working. It was painfully long. You even consider stepping out of the theatre. Apart from that the casting was great. Acting by Cillian, Emily, Florence, Robert Downey was exceptional. We actually feel that we are in the 1940s as the costume, makeup, set was perfect.The bomb making and testing scenes were awesome and it makes us feel everything is real. (Literally it felt the ground was shaking during these scenes)The storyline was simple. It followed personal and professional life of Oppenheimer also involving characters that were in and out of his life. Must watch in IMAX if you want to experience the cinematic beauty of this film."
"The first hour of this film in particular has every cliché you've ever seen in a biographical movie come up again and again. What I found most annoying is this assumption that the audience can never understand any of the science involved in the story, so the makers substitute writing frantically on blackboards, cutting to sparks on a black screen, and the character being described as ""brilliant genius"", presumably because he can see the sparks whereas other people can't. Without any sort of context, the science is a meaningless abstract reference and the real story is lost. As for Cillian Murphy, he could have had a great career as a half forward for Nemo Rangers if he'd played his cards right and now look at him- sitting on an armchair stark naked in front of millions of people like an eejit."
"First, it is a good movie overall with great actors and an interesting story. Second, it is highly overrated and most people (americans) out there see ""Nolan"" and start screaming it is the best movie of all times blablabla. This was adapted from a book so dont expect anything mindblowing in the story, it's just what it is: a biography.I was very disappointed in the fact that Nolan did not bring that amazing view of things as he did in interstellar or tenet and I was let down by the scientific details. I would have loved to learn more about the engineering challenges behind the project and also I was expected an original view of the atomic explosion. I really felt I learnt nothing new about that part of history and the movie was quite simple to understand without any big surprise at the end. But again it is a good movie, well made and interesting. I was just disappointed and I had much higher expectations mostly fueled by the high rating this movie received which is not justified."
"This film has everything laid out. I have been looking forward to it for months. Like others, Nolan is one of my favorite directors, nay, probably my favorite director of all time. All the critics raved about this film. The trailer made it look like something that I could take my kids to for the discussion I expected we would have afterward - even if I had to cover their eyes during the nude scenes. I was expecting to come out of this picture blown away and I even paid $25 to see it with a friend in IMAX first just to double check it was tween friendly enough. Well, I am sorry to say it was an enormous let down. Was it a decent flick? Sure. The cinematography was good, the story is interesting kind of, but let's be real here, Oppenheimer himself is not the interesting part of the story, the bomb is. The fact that you have to murder tens of thousands of people in order to save tens of thousands more. What the bomb does to people who aren't vaporized when it goes off. This was just barely touched on in the film. There are no scenes of mathematicians working feverishly, no real feeling of how large of a project this must have really been. There are snippets of things here and there about the project, but this really is JUST A BIOPIC of Oppenheimer. And somewhat of this Strauss guy that history pretty much has forgotten. And truth be told, none of it was really that interesting to me. Feynman would have made a much more interesting film, IMO. So, was it OK? Yeah, it was OK. Am I glad I spent $25 to see this in the theater? Nope. This is a rental, if you have nothing better to watch. But do yourself a favor, go get The Dark Knight or Interstellar and watch that again - you'll be happier in the end. If you want something kind of along the same vein that's a better movie, see The Imitation Game. If you are looking for.a thought provoking movie, watch The Fog of War."
"Oppenheimer - 7/10Saw this on opening day at a sold-out BFI iMax with James Acaster in attendance. Proper bombs of dread.Lots of anticipation for this one and I've long been curious as to how it justifies the 3-hour run time. I assumed that running that length would mean that we have multiple set pieces, but it really does just focus on the Trinity test. Hiroshima and Nagasaki happen off screen, and we instead focus on the Manhattan project and 'court room drama' that unfolds in the aftermath of the Trinity test.This is Christopher Nolan's JFK, with a healthy dose of The Social Network and a sprinkling of abstract imagery. I would have liked a bit more surrealism, but I guess Nolan would be well aware of what David Lynch achieved in Twin Peaks: The Return episode 8 so he keeps it restrained. It's more history lesson than blockbuster and I'm sure there are many people out there that expected a completely different film. The marketing made it look like it could be an action-packed race against time but it's much more academic and dialogue heavy.If you're interested in exploring Robert Oppenheimer's story in forensic detail, then this is the film for you. Just don't go expecting an all-encompassing retelling of the ending of the second world war.It's a very well-made film, but it's intense and a lot to take in. You must be in the right mood. I won't be in a rush to see it again and I certainly wouldn't be raving about it and recommending it to everyone. A slog, but an interesting and worthwhile slog.It will SWEEP at the Oscars."
"I don't grasp what's all the fuss about this movie. Three damn hours of talking blah blah blah.. and one terribly shot nuclear explosion. I wish Barbie was not banned in the Middle East.Besides, its so funny that everyone was fighting to watch this BS film on a real IMAX! Come on guys, i wouldn't play this sheeyat movie on my old Panasonic radio. It's just so dumb film to watch. I'm pretty sure Nolan has no clue what's this film about. He probably thinks it's about WW3 or smothing LOL.Having that said, with all due respect, Nolan is not a genius and someone had to stop him from doing more garbage films."
"So today I watched Oppenheimer and it was good. I was extremely excited for this one and my expectation meter was quite high but it turned out to be just good, not extraordinary or beyond expectation, it was a good movie.A lot of the things Nolan did right in this one: to begin with he remained very true to the source material. Also, he made everyone acted their hearts out which was quite an astonishing feat.Acting on the other hand was amazing, Robert Downey Jr. Will definitely get an Oscar for his performance so will Emily Blunt. Matt Damon was also outstanding but Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer was the star and his acting was beyond outstanding and it makes sense because it was a movie driven by acting and the script and Nolan made it look quite captivating.Now we'll come to some of the things I didn't like: I'm not a fan of Nolan's style of directing, although he did some thing differently in the first hour of the movie but then got back to his old roots and it felt like a sequel to Inception or any one of his movies.Also, for the life of me the way his characters talk. Dear Lord, no one talks like that in real life, he's got so much plot within a plot within a plot going that every single character tries to explain what's happening and what direction the film is taking.I guess I would've enjoyed the movie better if it wasn't that hyped to an extent where some people I know were saying ""that was the darkest movie they have ever seen"" which was clearly not the case.Anyways, I would recommend you to let the hype die a bit then watch it and you may end up enjoying it a lot more than I did or if you're really impatient then catch the hype train and see for yourself what I'm saying.Apart from a few things he did differently it was just another Nolan flick that people were dying for (including myself but I was roped in sadly) I came home a wee bit disappointed because I watched a lot of interviews on him taking a different direction and all but nope, walked right into that one.My rating 7/10
Peace."
"Oppenheimers SnoozefestShort points
Pace is to slow
After the bomb goes off, movies drags on for
Another hour...
Constant back and forth without a hint of an
Explanation is exhausting
Overall boring inattentive filming
An Exercise of, Because I Can, from Nolan
What's imax worthy here?This story would have been better and had made more sense if all of Oppenheimers moral qualms would have been dealt with before the bomb goes off in the test. This way in the final act, the explosion could have been the bell that has been rung and can't be unrung. Adding Gravitas to the story. Instead, after the test bomb goes off, the movie grinds on for another hour...Although it is Oppenheimers story, as such the movie failed to portray the wider implications of Oppenheimers doing. The effects on Japan itself. With that, Nolan failed spectacularly to deal with this subject matter in a critical way. It deforms into a merely pseudo intellectual exercise of vapid grandeur.Imagine Germany produced a Movie about the concentration camps and merely brushes off the wider implications with, We needed to do it to end the war, like it's done in Nolan's latest work as justification for the US to commit this heinous crime, twice. Therefore, the attempt of portraying Oppenheimers guilt falls flat on the face for me, a mere afterthought, a noisy one at that.Soundtrack:
As seems typical with Nolan's efforts the soundtrack tends to drown out everything else in parts. Towards the end, when Oppenheimer is questioned by Strauss goons, there is this cacophony of noise so annoying and unnecessary it actually is painful. I get what Nolan tried to achieve. However he choose to submit the audience by literally have the movie shout at it and beat the audience into submission.The story telling here requires the viewer to pay one hundred percent attention for all of it. Even then a second viewing is needed. Haunting imagination that...The acting is great, shame about the scriptThis is a snooze fest of epic proportions, not for everyone."
"The movie itself is not about the Manhattan Project. Its merely depicted. It instead heavily focuses on Oppenheimer himself. The movie is tasked with answering a single question throughout the entire movie: Is Oppenheimer a man to be trusted? The development of the movie is very well designed. Oppenheimer is a complicated man, with strong beliefs and who is entitled to those beliefs, and yet he is constantly interrogated for not just being the man who invented the atomic bomb, but for whether or not he is being loyal to America. Forces beyond his control and people who plot against him, but he has the wit and strength of a scientist who must prove to no one that he is in fact human.The plot since it tells the story of Oppenheimer is very well written. Its highly intelligent and has many twists. Its told in the past, present, future with referencing each many times. The beginning is a bit slow and theres a lot of science knowledge everywhere so any audience members that dont know a lot will end up being confused. But the dialogue is very intelligent and theres lots of it, frankly sometimes there too much of it to where it gets boring.However, the camera focuses mostly on Oppenheimers perspective, shots can be seen from multiple angles. The sound was thrilling, startling, loud, and suprisingly powerful. It captured the movie. Not just the bomb itself, but its like we are in Oppenheimer's mind breathing in his sights and hearing thoughts. The graphics are just as powerful that captures the attention of the audience.Overall, the purpose of this movie is a hidden message-to determine if Oppenheimer is trustworthy to science and to America. He is tasked with building a bomb, and he feels the weight of not entirely being thrilled about it. He is convicted of the humanity of killing a death weapon, that would at that time possibly destroy the world. The task is difficult because Oppenheimer is put into a difficult position for the sake of the war.But once the war is over, he feels the fear of others against him. Oppenheimer is after all only human. He expresses remorse and makes mistakes in the movie that shatters his family. He grieves for those who the bomb killed. He advocates for the freedom of having strong beliefs such as his. And so the movie must then answer the question, should America give him security clearance? Is he a good citizen?"
"Is it a movie about the Manhattan project?Is it a movie about regret and transformations that ensued in Oppenheimer when he made the bomb?Is it a courtroom drama?Is it a young physicist's transformation into a genius manager who brought everyone together to achieve the impossible?Nolan tried to make it about everything and well none of it hits the mark.The affairs of Oppenheimer don't really add anything to the movie.The music score is so constant that it gives one a headache - if a scene warrants a score like that then it complements the film. Here the happenings were not so intense as the music score was hinting towards.Nothing was at stake for Oppenheimer ever. His reputation was being shown to be something that can be tarnished - but I don't think it was gonna be a big slander or bother. His reputation was just not as big a deal or rather the film failed to make it a big deal.And yeah I really couldn't care much about the antagonist. Strauss? I don't care really, he didn't have a personality as big as Oppenheimer. I mean I just couldn't perceive him to be a credible threat."
"Like other Nolan's movie ;
it's not for everyone. If you aren't willing to be forced to think for 3 hours straight, this movie aren't gonna suit you.Though it's a historical movie about inventing the atomic bomb in world war, it's totally different from ""dunkirk."" there's a lot of debates and trial, so it's more political than i thought it would be.Nolan said the audience will able to feel the explosion through the screen. Well, it's loud enough to gave me a new and intense experience that i never had. (girl beside me was covering her ears all the time)the cinematography was great as always. Though the best experience is on imax, but they're not provide any of it here. I guess that's why the screen isn't fully filled but no big deal.Also, you already know Cillian would totally rocks his role. This man just *chef's kiss*"
"This might be a controversial opinion, I thought the movie was boring, I felt this movie could have been a 30 minute YouTube documentary than 3 hours feature film. I felt the sound design was lazy. I was a bit underwhelmed by it.I feel that if we were to wind back time and re release this movie as directed by another alias, this movie wouldn't have this much rating.I had found a YouTube video of Robert Oppenheimer story by veretasium more entertaining than the Nolan's movie.On positive note, all the actors were exceptional. May be it's a bit unfair on Nolan that I had high expectations and the movie did not deliver."
"Oppenheimer was an experience.The film, in many ways, was exceptional and clearly made by Nolan. However, compared to his other films, this one is a mixed bag.1. For a stacked cast filled with actors such as R. Downey Jr, Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt, and Cillian Murphy, you would expect the characters to be connectable. Well, not the case. There is no real emotional depth or storyline in this movie, which in succession caused it to lose intensity the farther you progress. Characters are rapidly introduced, all seeming to process some importance by the end in reference to Oppenheimer's final Security Check. However, during these final testimonies it is extremely difficult to feel any sympathy or connection with these characters. Though dramatized events in Oppenheimer's life are constantly explored, he still remains a distant protagonist. Emily Blunts character is one of the only characters to show emotional expression. I feel the point of historical bio-pictures is to make the characters more connectable, dramatized even.2. Though I see little to no one pointing this out, I feel like both nudity scenes in the movie were entirely avoidable. Both scenes added little to nothing to the plot, besides the reveal of Oppenheimer's affair, which could've shown without such,.3. Personally, I feel this movie doesn't quite convey the significance
of the events it follows after the initial bomb test. The non-linear typically Nolan timeline downplays the events. The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki we only hear Truman over the radio? The announcement of the bombings almost initially passed over me due to the quiet audio during this scene as well. After watching a 3 hour movie centered around the atomic bomb, selfishly, I would've at least liked to have see at least one of cities get actually bombed. Flashing scenes between alleged communism and choppy dialogue left a quite boring and rather confusing second half. A whirlwind of heavy dialogue and different timelines/perspectives that ultimately conveyed a rather confusing story of Oppenheimer. For a viewer going into this movie with little to no previous knowledge on the psyche that came with the atomic bomb, you will be confused. This movie provides little to no exposition for characters political sides regarding the bomb or general morals. Typically, I understand not having a large amount of exposition for the sake of keeping the plot rolling. However, for a 3 hour movie this courtesy was not granted.4. Overall, the soundtrack wasn't stellar, though it was extremely loud. The constant intrusion of music and loud noises took away from the film itself. In many cases I found myself reaching to gasp bits of unintelligible dialogue.5. The cinematography in this movie was amazing, along with the set designs, and hidden details. Granted, there were your traditional terrific Nolan details which made the film gratifying, but overall maybe little to no impact."
"This was such a disappointment. The movie was unnecessarily long for no reason and could have told the identical story with the same, if not better, impact in an hour less. It was generally just boring and not engaging. Full of old white men just talking and talking with little or nothing to say. The only two females in the film feel like token women with no personality or story other than 'mistresses'. The black and white felt gimmicky and made an already drab and boring film even more dull.I really wouldn't bother and actually regret spending my evening on this. And don't go out of your way to find iMax, it makes no difference at all."
"By no means is Oppenheimer a bad film - in fact I would recommend anyone looking for an experience to go check it out. However I do believe the film is a bit unorganized and is largely saved by good performances and great cinematography, at least up until the last one-half to one-third. After that, the story takes a more ""traditional"" route and cleans everything up nicely, barring a few things which I wish were done differently.Again. I highly recommend this film to anyone who is looking for an alternative and perhaps a bit more ""high roller"" drama in the same category as ""The Theory of Everything"" / ""Goodwill Hunting"" / "" A Beautiful Mind"""
"Contrary to Christopher Nolan's advice, the ""ideal"" way to watch this movie is in a concrete bunker with gun range headphones. It is absolutely too load to watch. As a veteran of Hendrix, Who, Stones, and Pink Floyd, I left after 10 minutes and got my money back. Thank goodness I didn't travel to one of the 30 theaters on the PLANET, that have the full IMAX experience. Frankly, while the visuals of New Mexico are wonderfully done, the story itself did not need that film quality. But, I'm sure the Hollywood crowd will applaud and award an Oscar that I see as blatantly bought. It's really no different that the campaigns companies put on to drum up support at Oscar time."
It's the first time I have this thought about Nolan' a movie . This movie I just feel disappointed. The movie wants to make like a combination of documentary and story. But it just don't go . Einstein is not an old retired old man walking around the river to tell u what it's right . And I don't get any point about those two naked scenes. Literally it doesn't help anything but make the film level to R . Oppenheimer is one of the greatest scientists ever . And he doesn't know if he made this the government wouldn't throw it out ?it's so joke when they said cuz culture they don't throw it to Kyoto. Like peoples life are nothing than culture.
"I was so very bored. They should have made 2 movies the making and detonation of the bomb and the persecution of Oppenheimer I would not see either. A plethora of dialogue that really did not interest me, however there was obviously much research done on this story so if you are a fan of government conspiracy, physics, math and endless discussions then maybe it's for you. The character of Kitty was just annoying, her 4th marriage, drank like a fish, couldn't handle being a parent almost giving up her child and then proceeded to have another, allowed her husband to cheat I just wanted to slap some sense into her. I definitely would have rather watched this at home so I could fall asleep in the comfort of my own house."
"For me this film felt like a disappointment in comparison to the trailer. I understand that trailers often show a glimpse of the film, and it is difficult to say whether it will actually actually meet the trailer expectations.One of the main things that stood out to me, was that all scenes were very short. They jumped from one place to another, within a matter of 30 seconds or less, without giving some time to the audience to fully immerse themselves into the experience of each scene. This experience reminded me of watching some Tik Tok short videos (too many transitions and scene cuts), and giving users a little shot of high stimulation. For me, this also created some difficulty to follow the storey along during the film, since every little scene was somehow created to be ""relevant"" on its own and made it distracting.It is a bit sad for me to reflect on this, because I felt that by bringing some high stimulation and short scenes to a film does not help our society to come down and relax, but instead to feed our society with more high stimulation, which already exist in so many places and I find to bring that forth even more to films is unnecessary.In terms of the duration of the film, I felt that it was very long, and some parts could have been cut out and still convey the same message.However, there were definitely some positive attributes, such as arriving at the period, when this actually took place, really good actors, amazing costume design and beautiful sense of aesthetics and cleanness. :)"
"This movie pretentiously tries to be intellectual and intelligently made. However, it was over done. It is a struggle to not fall asleep during this film.This film reminds me of 300, Last of the Mohicans, and the Last Samurai. Possibly we'll made if you invest in alternative and Eurocentric ideology.Over-hyped is the best way to describe this film.This film pulls on the heartstrings of those that yearn for another Gladiator, Schindler's List, Godfather 1 & 2. This is far from it. Yet, it was advertised as if it was a groundbreaking film that deserves to be of the ilk of classics.The Autobiography of Malcolm X was by far a better biopic. However, would never see the light of day such as this film because it was done on a black."
"I wanted to rate this higher, but it was a struggle to watch the first two hours. We saw this in a Regal RPX theater and the musical score was deafening. I don't know if others feel the same way but there were many parts where I didn't make out the dialogue. The jumping around between scenes combined with the booming soundtrack underneath made it extremely difficult for me to understand what was happening at all times. I'll have to watch this again, at home, with the subtitles on. That being said, the third and final hour of the movie absolutely blew me away. Wow. We already know Oppenheimer made the bomb. We know the bombs were used on Japan (and WHY didn't Nolan show us that!??) But the AEC security commission review ""trial"" and the Senate nomination hearings for Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr's role) could have been a standalone movie all by itself and I loved it. I read a lot of people didn't like the third hour but I completely disagree. It's the other way around for me."
"I was so excited to see this movie since I am a big Nolan and Murphy fan, but I am hugely disappointed, the movie was too long and boring most of the times, they just glorified the act of making and dropping bombs(same usa propoganda).No doubt the visuals and acting was amazing but to sit through 3 hours and watch people just talk and arguing was not entertaining at all, they didn't even show the scenes or real bombing and what happened aftermath the bombings in Japan, there were too many characters to keep track of. Yes it has some scenes which will amaze and awe the viewers but overall it was disappointing for me😒"
"I am contemplating a biopic.. my own. At 62, I have grown larger than I could have, had I had a hurdle free life much larger than I could have envisaged when I arrived in a new country at 25. And I was researching movies that I would rate 10, or some thing I could watch over and again and still find domethong new to take home. And kept a log of my research through imdb reviews.Oppenheimer doesn't quite cut it there, and I want to document it, just keeping me honest in my own objectivity at this point in time, no more, no less.It's hard to place my hand what but the movie left me with several unresolved data points, unintentionally, that its unacceptable to me given there were so many hours to resolve them."
"Too long, too much boring dialogue. There is more than an hour of film left. They forgot the primary objective of cinema, which is to entertain, and they got lost in cinematography, editing, sound, etc. How is it possible to make a movie about the father of the boring atomic bomb? The first hour and a half is so heavy. Unintelligible dialogues. Scientists sitting at the table boring us to infinity. The Florence Pugh part is so inconsequential. Luckily the last half hour with a brilliant Robert Downey Jr. The movie was better. Best: Robert Downey Jr. Worst: Overrated Everything. We need better stories."
"Personally this was the most anticipated movie this year, if not the most anticipated in the last 5 years. Considering the pile of ... subpar production that is overflowing the industry lately it definitely deserves your attention, however I was left with the feeling that it could have been so much more, and sadly it wasn't. Since I am not an expert, I am not going to delve deep into the cinematography and I am pretty sure there aren't many people that are in position to criticize or evaluate Christopher Nolan when it comes to that. For me, personally, the action felt too fragmented at times, which disrupted the flow of the whole movie too much and left me with this unsettling feeling that the story could have been told better. I understand the logic behind the retrospection and I know that this technique has served Nolan beautifully on previous occasions, nevertheless I reckon it was exploited too much here. Moreover, the soundtrack was too intrusive at times and it was forcing your attention into the moment instead of guiding it.Robert Downey Jr. Was great, probably one of his best works so far. Cillian Murphy also did a nice job in portraying the complex and disturbed nature of the person who brought to existence the deadliest weapon known to man.As a science and physics geek I did expect the story to be more centered around the science breakthrough and philosophical implications of the nuclear weapons, but unfortunately it was more about ideology and political maneuvering within the Atomic Energy Commission.It was a nice cinematic experience as a whole, but I wouldn't rank this among Nolan's best."
"The story was great, we got a typical nolan screenplay cillian murphy, RDJ and matt damon acted brilliantly. The other stars like emily blunt were wasted they could have gotten more screen presence. Personally I think some scenes should be better especially Oppenheimer's university days and his mental health. The VFX was simply stunning,Nolan was not kidding when he said that he is gonna detonate a real bomb. The pace was giod but some scenes felt rushed especially the beginning. I like the fact that Nolan did not glorify the main character or make him likeable like most biopic directors tend to do. The ending was simply superb. Overall this is not Nolan's best movie but arguably one of his movies to be remembered. Now, coming to the point why I gave it 1 instead of a 8 is because of one scene. Yes it is the bhagavad gita scene. I don't know if Nolan wanted to convey something by keeping a holy book in midst of a sex scene or just wanted to do introduce bhagavad gita and he did not care about the significance of the book, be it any reason keeping a holy book of a religion in a sex scene and not less near a women's private parts is just not accepatable and is disrespectful to the religion. Just imagine if it was bible instead of bhagavad gita would'nt it be mortifying. The director and actor should respond to this or delete the scene from the movie itself."
"So... saw the movie ""Oppenheimer"" last night on opening night. Happy to see that against ""Barbie,"" a movie about history was doing relatively well-theater packed. But this movie was done in typical Christopher Nolan film, most shots lasting 5 seconds or less resulting in a jumping narrative style, that when combined with the technical jargon and the too loud ""Hans Zimmer-like"" soundtrack made it difficult to understand, even for a physics-degreed guy wearing hearing aids.Warning: spoiler alerts contained below!BLUF: they get the history mostly right, although they attribute certain conversations to the wrong people. Nolan says he did this for clarity in the reduction of number of characters, but in a movie with more than 30 main characters you are expected to track, I can't see how adding one or two more to correct the history would have hurt.Did I love it? Well, I liked it a lot. I loved the presentation of the physics. Brought me back to my two undergrad courses in quantum theory. Loved the discussion of whether the bomb would set the atmosphere on fire. That was one of the conversations attributed to the wrong guy-the actual guy who did those calculations was one of my grad school profs Robert Hamming. In the movie Oppie asks Einstein in one scene to do the calculation (never happened) and in another scene it was an unnamed character (likely my old prof) who tells Oppie that the probability is ""near zero."" Fun note: in one of my grad school courses ""Hamming on Hamming"" he went through those equations with us.And I loved seeing Tom Conti's portrayal of Albert Einstein. Having read all of Einstein's books in my undergrad days, Conti plays him exactly as I have imagined him.Another fun scene is when Oppie starts teaching his first class (Berkeley?) and tells his one student who is trying to understand quantum, ""You're looking at it the wrong way."" I wish I had that prof. I was looking at it the wrong way in undergrad too, but nobody was ever bold enough to tell me that.But I did not like the gratuitous sex, which added nothing to drive the story forward and seems to have been inserted just because it's what British filmmakers do.So back to the movie: It ran for 3 hours and didn't feel like it. There were slow parts but I never found myself looking at my watch. The chronology was difficult to follow despite jumping from color (paradoxically, for the sequences happening in the 1940s-1954) and black & white (for the Senate scenes with Admiral Lewis Strauss-played by Robert Downey Jr- mostly taking place in 1959). Strauss is the antagonist who never attended college, made enemies of Chester Nimitz, yet gets a Navy reserve ""graveyard promotion"" to rear admiral right after WWII and insists on being called ""admiral"" for the rest of his life. He has a giant chip on his shoulder throughout the movie, which apparently was accurate.Was the movie accurate from a historical sense? Very much so. Even some of the more contrived and unbelievable scenes (such as the ""more useful than a sandwich"" scene which humiliated Strauss) actually happened.If you put differences in Nolan's jumpy, distracting narrative style aside, his biggest miss with the movie is his failure to recognize that something can be ""regrettable,"" yet one still may not regret it.This is the matter Nolan goes back and forth with Oppenheimer at the end. Does he regret the Hiroshima bomb? Oppenheimer does not say. Yet Oppie clearly feels that the need to drop the bomb was regrettable. Nolan goes back and forth with this as if it is a paradox, but it's not. Any sane human being regrets the fact that something substantial had to happen for the war to end. And as we cover in our episodes of ""The Unauthorized History of the Pacific War"" podcast, dropping the bomb was the least bad choice of many really bad options, one which actually minimized the loss of life necessary to end the war. Anyone who thinks otherwise has to ignore the facts of the conflict and many contemporary statements, most notably from the Japanese leaders themselves.Is ""Oppenheimer"" worth seeing? Absolutely- if for no other reason than we need serious movies to compete in the box office with comic book and toy movies else they will stop making serious movies.But whatever you do, stay to the end, that final scene with Oppenheimer and Einstein. The closing line of that movie may be one of the best lines for film ever written."
I was so excited to watch this movie. My dream shattered and it's one of the most boring movie. First flop of Christopher Nolan.I won't trust the ratings anymore. It's just a scam I think. There was nothing in the movie...please save your time and money. Don't watch this movie. I am Nolan fan but it doesn't mean that I am going to like a messed up movie. After watching for over two hours. I decided sleep is better than watching this movie.1 star only for music.. they were just babbling in the whole movie. It's awful experience and I wasted my night. I am writing the review to save time and money of the people.
"Christopher Nolan is a mastermind at coming up with novel concepts like in Inception, Memento and Tenet. That's what makes him Nolan in my humble opinion. He has also proved to be a genius when it comes to action fantasies like in The Batman Trilogy. Nolan is also the best when it comes to thrillers whether they are sci-fi thrillers such as Interstellar or war thrillers such as Dunkirk or psychological thrillers such as The Prestige and Insomnia. So he experiments with different genres and here he is, yet again, embarking on a whole new genre, biographical movies! Most biographical movies are boring, lame and empty but this one is the best biopic I've ever seen. I mean, the black and white scenes, the loud bombing in the IMAX theatre, the storytelling and the phenomenal score in the background, all of that fits together really well in a 3 hour screenplay that takes you away from reality and makes you lose your sense of time. When the credits rolled I was in shock knowing that 3 hours had just passed by because to me it literally felt like 30 minutes. It was unbelievable. However, I think Chris Nolan is poor at writing drama. It's his biggest weakness and unfortunately Oppenheimer is only about personal drama so it doesn't have any aspects at which Nolan could show his strengths. The drama in Oppenheimer was not deep enough and didn't hit hard enough. I would give it 7.5/10 but this website doesn't allow fractions so I can only choose between 7 or 8 and I went with 7 haha. I think you can find poor drama in all Nolan movies as well but that's not always obvious because most of his work is not about drama alone unlike Oppenheimer. The most obvious example is Tenet, it doesn't have any emotions or drama and If not for the brilliant concept in Tenet, the whole movie would have been a total waste of time. I don't know how can Nolan improve in drama writing. It's the only flaw in Oppenheimer. Nonetheless, I'm a big fan of Christopher Nolan and I enjoyed watching Oppenheimer."
"Really? Guys you really believe that? IS Oppenheimer Understood bhagwad geeta?& Accept with pure heart? No..he used Bhagwad geeta as Tool kit. & to get over regrets & guilt. & christopher nolan bloody conservative you made it intentionally bcz all western conservatives,hate hindusam & hindu culture. You shown bhagwad geeta in intimate scenes! I appreciate christopher nolan in technical way. But your thinking about as it s very wrong. Narayan hari. I offer my obeisances to the cowherd boy who holds the cow's garden and who is in the form of a cowherd boy.Gokulatsavamishanam Govindaam. Madhav."
"With a decent screenplay and camerawork, Oppenheimer stands just above the surface of the worst. It's Cillian Murphy who makes you wanna sit and enjoy the 3 hours with his acting. The other cat members are also supportive to Nolan's good direction. There are certain scenes which are quite different from Nolan's previous movies, that's because it's a biopic. The first person experience and the court drama would make you feel bored but the sudden adrenaline of senses the music triggers just want to make you sit and watch what's gonna happen next. This movie and not for action lovers. It's kind of an new direction experiment film to Chris Nolan."
"I went to the theater with very high expectations, but sadly enough they were not met. Especially from Christopher Nolan I would have expected something better.The choice of telling the story out of order made it very difficult to follow especially if you do not know anything about Openheimer in advance. So I would really recommend to do a small research in advance to enjoy the movie more, since I had more questions in the end than answers.This movie also introduces so many people and names, which makes it almost impossible to remember them all and follow the story easily. In this story they could have easily left some people out that had no sufficiently large role. This movie would have been better for a series, to flesh out the characters that are there better. Or I would have removed everything about Strauss, because it made this movie way too long and did not really add anything to the story of Oppenheimer.The score and cinematography on the other hand were fantastic. Also the actors on screen are doing all an amazing job."
"The pacing will take you aback at first; Oppenheimer meets and divorces his wife within 5 minutes, but it's the price to pay to set the context for the two big moments later in the film.Understandably, it's hard to tell someone's entire life story in 3hrs while also creating enough drama to keep an audience hooked. Nolan chose to tell two stories, which is definitely engaging, but it ends up feeling like there's a first act, but then 2 3rd acts.There's also more ambitious filmmaking, but it comes off as a little self indulgent, especially with 2 awkward sex scenes posing as ""art"".With that said though, Nolan knows how to keep you engaged. There's a literal minute long countdown and I could feel my heart building with each second. Even after 2hrs, I still refused to allow my attention to slip thanks to the engaging cutting between scenes in multiple points in Oppenheimers life and building to a second crescendo.Last weird technical thing to note: the camera loses focus a lot, especially in the last hour. Clearly they were running at a low aperture on a medium format camera, but that meant even the slightest deviation on the focus was noticeable. I saw tons of shots where someone's ear or nose was in focus but not their eyes, because with such high ape rather you can't be off by a single cm.Definitly check out the film though, and obviously in IMAX if you can since I saw it in standard cinema and felt like I was missing out on something better."
"Like other reviews, I was really looking forward to watching this movie. The trailer looked great, there was a fantastic lineup of actors and the plot was an important part of our history.Yet an hour into the movie, I just got up and left. I found the movie jumped around continuously (to multiple different scenes) which made it hard to follow.There was little flow or continuity between some of the scenes, yet this constant (often dramatic) music played in the background, which I found irritating.I had high expectations for Oppenheimer, yet this was a flop in my opinion. I wouldn't waste my time or money on it unless you like arty or boring movies.Sadly I watched some bad ones in the past and this is right up there with The Lobster.What a disappointment, especially after all the hype."
"Christopher Nolans Filmography is one of the most respected of all time. And I think it´s deserved. But this time Nolan did not nearly reach the level of his previous movies. Oppenheimer starts so confusing you can not grasp what is going on. The timelines switch almost randomly and scenes that feel important are stopped just to pick them up again at a random point later on.In addition to that, Robert Oppenheimer ist portrayed as a maniac-like man, who is obsessed with atoms and quantom-physics, which is shown through trip-like sequences. This man shown in the movie is nothing like the man I know from the interviews he gave post bombing. I do not see the man who spoke with tears in his eyes, regretting what he did.And to add to all of that, Nolan (of course) has to build in a twist. But this twist is so useless, it actually bothered me. Not every great movie has to have a twist but seemingly Nolan thinks otherwise.The movie does get better after the first one and a half hours. The skipping between the timezones declines a bit by then. But towards the end, when all the times finally come together, for me all hope was already lost. The end for me almost feels like a teaser for the cold war. The building of the rockets is seen and Oppenheimer constantly tries to prevent a arms race. That is not how Nolan used to work. And I know Nolan can do better. But he didn´t this time.Sadly, this movie was not was I expected. But you can´t always get what you want, right? And atleast all the actors did a great job, especially Cilian Murphy."
"The whole movie builds up to the final scene being a propaganda message about mankind destroying itself with the bomb. We have had nukes for over 50 years and has not happened. Hollywood should pull its head out of its asd and just stick to storytelling. So sick of every movie turning into propaganda, gone are the days of Hollywood putting out anything worth watching. I am done watching anything on release day. I will want to hear a review of a film before going to watch it from now on. On the upside at least it accurately portrayed how self serving narcissists step on anyone they can to get a position of government power."
"6.5 at best. I'm mid-60's in age and grew up with the fear of atomics. I've always been fascinated with this era and at some level, very interested in the technology used to develop and test the device, and the politics and military's demand to use during war-time. This movie did touch on some of the thinking present during that time leading to the decisions. I enjoy learning, reading, and watching anything to do with WWII. My father was in the war, so I have some ties to this. Growing up on the West coast (of CA) I was in close proximity to many of the research areas, such as Stanford, and Lawrence Livermore Labs.I tried not to fall into the over-hype of this movie prior to its release, but really looked forward to seeing it. The Regal ""RPX"" theater was maybe a third full (Sunday at 3:00p). The filmography was not necessarily impressive - top notch, but not outstanding or superior. Some of the edits were annoying, constantly flipping between different time lines, and using B&W vs. Color to help show ""artistic license"", I suppose. It was more annoying. I do like B&W, however and when done well, it's very impressive.The sound quality was the most annoying part of the movie. It was very, very loud at times. I noticed my 20-something son sitting next to me covering his ears perhaps 3 different times. Several others in the theater were doing the same. The music was unfitting for this movie. It really felt like music that would be used during a two-minute film trailer to advertise a new movie, however the music lasted 3 hours. It did nothing to add ambiance or mood to the scenes. It was a distraction at best. Some dialog was rolled over by the music and was missed.As a comparison, ""Fat Man and Little Boy"" (staring Paul Newman) is a much better story - compelling, sufficiently detailed in the technical aspects, and helped to tell the broader narrative of the teams that worked on this project. The scene showing the Trinity test was, frankly, a letdown. Others have commented here, so I'll let that one go.Matt Damon had some terrific moments early in the movie, but it wasn't sustained. Emily Blunt's character was muted, and somehow lost in some of her impact. The most moving scene was when she ""watched"" her husband with the other woman. Although the scene told a story, it was unnecessary. Better writing could have brought the audience to resonate with her despise and hate. Cilian Murphy's performance was terrific, but not Oscar worthy. Robert Downey Jr. Did an outstanding job and took me for a bit of a ride early on. I ended up flipping on his character, which at the end of the movie, not so subtly illustrates his motives. Not a good look for the man, but it was finally addressed in the way that the average movie goer could understand. It was refreshing to see Einstein portrayed in this movie, but I'm not sure if that was closer to reality or just the clever inklings of a writer.Overall, I'm glad I saw it, and it is still drifting around in my head - which is one good sign that it made an impact. I'll probably watch it again when available to stream at home....with sub-titles."
"Exaltation of the character, where other physicists of greater importance such as Einstein or Heisenberg remain in the background. The references to Hiroshima and Nagasaki are very light and the effects of the explosion on the Japanese civilian population are not described at all. Made-in-USA product.Exaltation of the character, where other physicists of greater importance such as Einstein or Heisenberg remain in the background.

"This was an exhausting movie. While Nolan shows respect to his audience by providing a challenging plot to keep up with, viewers must actively listen to all the dialogue to follow along, a task which lasts the entire 3 hours. While the music and some of the visuals are great, the characters were not likable. Their complexity was evident but somehow non of them were relatable. The plot was detailed but seemed somewhat revisionist. The communists, the Japanese, and the protagonist himself were shown to be unjustly victimized. The movie is full of tension but never quite delivers. The payoff was entirely un-atomic. I don't see myself re-watching this movie.My ears are still ringing the day after. Perhaps that was the point."
"Capturing a wide array of historic events, characters and themes into one all-encompassing movie proves to be a difficult challenge for any director, and this one is no different.The audiovisual spectacle and certain performances (Robert Downey jr. In example) aside, the majority of scenes felt chaotic, sudden, and lacked length, leaving you with a constant sense of getting outpaced and needing to catch up. It's not necessarily the complexity of the chosen themes, but directional choices in how to portray them, that makes Oppenheimer feel like an overextended film trailer. Watching this is a Sisyphean task if you ask me."
"In the middle of the ""over the speed limit"" pacing of the movie i was pretty much annoyed by all the lound music and jumpy cuts and moving your focus with lightning speed from one thing to another .I unfortunately felt that i needed to get over with it already . The acting was impeccable both murphy and robert were amazing .All i thought about was "" if only they just slowed it down and made it like chernobyl"" i wish i have loved it as much as everyone else but it was not the nolan movie i wanted to see .The story is amazing and how it was told was good also . It's such a shame that i felt the need to run out of the theatre as soon as it was done ."
"By the hour and a half mark I was fighting to stay awake, this film is over hyped and convoluted. A good portion of it is just unnecessarily loud sounds for no reason and people yelling at each other. The entire thing felt like a poorly put together indie film festival entry. The explosion that was so hyped up was mediocre at best, I heard it wasn't cgi and that I should be impressed by it but that was not the case. I goto movies in theatre to be wowed, I don't care if it's cgi or 'real' as long as it's impressive and well done.The only way I recommend this movie is if you're looking for something to fall asleep to with it playing in the background. I would give this movie 0/10 if possible for the absolute waste of 3 hours. With all that being said it will probably go on to win academy awards and Oscar's."
"Christopher Nolan's obsession with hyperbolic noise and graphics comes to a head in 'Oppenheimer' in a long-foreseen bang, but the aftermath is short lived.Cillian Murphy and, really, everybody's acting in this film was excellent. The set pieces, dedication to maintaining the historic aesthetic, and aging makeup were all awe inspiring. But why the mediocre score? The story didn't marry to Nolan's vision as well as he'd hoped.We all know that Christopher Nolan loves to try and strike a chord through loud moments (warranted or not) and breakneck pacing. Perhaps being limited to a 3-hour cut made it more difficult to follow and find relatability. Perhaps it was the uneasy feeling that Nolan tried to make a mountain out of a molehill. Do you remember Strauss and his ""trial""? Do you know who he is at all? Do you care?The scientific and engineering focus left me wanting greatly. There was so much potential to explore the process of how the other 40,000 people attached to the Manhattan Project contributed and aided to help the U. S. create the atomic bomb. Instead, we're stuck suffering through all the low-key misdeeds of Oppenheimer to build up our internal conflict with the man and his actions. It's fun to see so many stars in various states, but is it necessary to tell a good story about the ""Father of the Atomic Bomb""?A spectacle of sorts can be found in this film which many of us have craved since the summer blockbuster took a long absence. However, many of us were sated with Top Gun: Maverick last year and can do without the incessant preaching on how ""war = bad, politics = bad"". Were we supposed to feel tricked by an internal struggle against rooting for the success of Oppenheimer and his team's objectives?I'd rather not give credit to such fabrication. Nobody walking out of the theater was talking about how intriguing it was to be a fly on the wall for a board review of a security clearance hearing or some guy being raked over the coals on his relationship with Oppenheimer. No, they were talking about the very short (but sweet) bomb we waited 3 hours for and Florence Pugh's boobs."

"The kind of movie which peaked at the moments leading to the main event rather than the main event. Honestly, was a bit disappointed considering the hype it got . The politics , which is there substantially in the film was kind of boring and lengthy . Not a fan of the explosion or the sound effects considering the hype the film got in that partCinematography was next level , just as what to expect from a Christopher Nolan movie .Acting was outstanding. Suprised by how well Emily blunt did the scenes and instilled a whole new wow factor to the movie . Also the Black and white IMAX shots were also beautiful which gave a different feel to the movie . Also , try to understand basics of atomic reactions and bombs to grasp the scientific aspects of the movie better before you watch it ."
"I was entertained and amused. But the judgement from the judges who made this film was questionable to say the least! I was promised Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice doing a track but that never happened I was promised a Heated Oppenheimer remix but that never happened. I was promised a Albert Einstein did the thing, Kitty Oppenheimer my woman king, Oppenheimer JR you are a genius and Tatlock Jean you are all of us! But no not even Ariana Debose or Ariana Grande what is this behaviour stop licking donuts and men that have no right belonging to you! I was promised Gigi Hadid in the film in Manhattan with Ganja but Miss Hadweed failed! Not even Cher bothered showing up to play a seductive Harry Truman desperate for a role as Seymour in Little shop of horrors! Somebody lied to me several times about what was in this film I took my grandma and she agreed that she would rather watch Barbie and she once threw a whole KFC bargain bucket at Ryan Gosling and told him he had a Crimson Chin in Crazy Stupid Love! Even Matt Hancock a history nerd is at home lockdowned in the bed with his missus! Cheers folks Alexis Michelle is crying again cause she had to watch this! Team Barbie folks I tell it as it is if you want a film that is all cat and no mouse then Barbie is the one."
"Another Christopher Nolan masterpiece, as it started out, but was quickly changed the tone when nudity was added in for no real reason at all. It honestly took away from the overall character of the film and ruined getting a pg-13 rating which would have been able to be seen by even more fans. It felt like something added in by producers to get more views or add something spicy to the content. It film was unreal, the acting was amazing, and the overall feel of the movie was left confused by the length and seemed drawn out more than his other films. It could have been a hour cut off in just unneeded dialogue."
I was disappointed in this Nolan movie because it's such a departure from his string of intense and cerebral movies. It's Mostly about politics during the time period. Great acting by all the cast but it has completely unnecessary soft porn that ruins the story line. Don't bring young kids! Good stuff includes the history of the creation of the bomb and how Oppy struggled with the consequences once it was built. The story line about how Strauss was involved was very interesting. I would bet that very few people know about his struggles after the WWII ended. This is a long one so get comfortable.
"Oppenheimer is a good drama and biopic, but not an extraordinary movie like Nolan has done previously. As a fan, I would highly encourage him to return to his unique genres.This movie has good drama and music, as we all expect from Nolan and Ludwig, along with good twist in second half. Oppenheimer also captured the post- and pre-events of the Manhattan Project. However, I was expecting another Inception, Interstellar, or Tenet. I guess it was my naiveté that, even though I knew it was a biography, I was still expecting those things. However, I would expect the next movie from Nolan to be another Inception, Interstellar, or Tenet."
"Nolan at this point is a kid, who was given a toy and wants to play with it day and night.If the screenplay and editing are compelling, then it doesnt matter what format we watch the film in. Whats the point of IMAX and your so called immersion, when you give me boring, under developed mess. I went to the movie, by just watching the trailer alone and what a boring mess.I understand, since it was shot on film and tightly bound to screenplay he wrote, so i dont think he shot extra footage or scenes or angles to choose when editing. I undetstand the criticism towards the editor and she was completely hands tied.NOLAN should understand nobody cares what format you shot, you didnt use CGI or what ever, we need a compelling drama true to its story. I was baffled to see the inverviews by him and by actors after watching the movie. Fact Nolan calls this a thriller and scary, may be he meant our situation after watching this movie coming out of theatres.Whats the point of N*** scenes or persay R rating for this. Absolute garbage. Emily blunt is seriously irritatting, I'm not sure if she read the same script before acting. Problem with RDJ is, he creates RDJ version of any character he plays and that charisma might not be suitable for every role. Chilian - better not talk about him.Music and Cinematography - Nolan's insistance on IMAX and specific way of structure, putting pressure on these two guys. For a score to flush out, you have to give some setup time, and if you constantly change the perscpective, what do you expect from any music director. Due to the extreme tonal shifts, either he was tied to irregular tunes or stuck with one and hoping that it work. DOP using hand held camera to create a tension or anxiety or what ever, should stop. Let us enjoy the image. I dont understand this madness in every movie, regardless of the genre.Finally, before approving Nolan's script, producers and studios should scrutinize him properly, and should definety stop over-usage of IMAX cameras. If your arrogance to stick with IMAX alone, instead of giving better visual experiance using CGI, is no use. Most of the scenes inside oppy's brain are some filters used for a wedding video or something. Half of the theatre walked way after 1 hour of the movie."
"To be honest, i watch this movie yesterday at IMAX cinema. But find it disappointing with the bombing scene only ""just like that""? I can have better visualization in Discovery Channel or National Geographic or other in Youtube. It is to much exaggerate the Kodak 70mm feature in this movie, while 4/5 of all movie duration wasting on the discussion, court scene, and talking session. I must be honest, what for the IMAX or Kodak 70mm for this movie?And most of half duration movie is debating about he is communist of not? So tired. Whilst the bombing in Hiroshima and Nagasaki is not even seen.This movie is overrated and overhyped. It is decent biography movie, but don't exaggerate it to much.Special appreciation to Cillian Murphy who try his best to live up the character, and also for the Einstein."
"Cillian Murphy acting is exceptional really , but i found the movie is so long and boring at several levels. This movie could make a great documentary movie really.Nolan is a great director, but for me still his top movies for me are ( interstellar, memento, the prestige, dark knight, insomnia)
its funny how social media can control everything these days , from day one of shooting this movie, everyone was talking about it.But in the other hand its good to see these kind of movies as almost all movies in the last few years are all about SciFi, superhero, sequel movies.Sorry for my bad English, its not my first language."
"Maybe I'm getting old, I don't know.. Im 31 so I guess that's not the case probably. I love love love love Nolan's movies. But this one didn't quite get me. Of course really good acting and the story was intriguing.But I really don't like the fastness of the cuts. Same as Elvis (weird comparison, I know) It's like they fill in for us viewers, that we are bored really easily. Slow down!! I want to see real people, dialogue, so that the big gestures really mean something. I found it almost a bit boring because the story went so quick and fast. Like I was missing the point all the time (what was probably true;)"
"Any art is a kind of medium that conveys an exciting idea in a mind to millions of minds. And if part of this attempt is successful, it would be a great masterpiece of art. Nolan has failed to convey that excitement since ""Tenet,"" and Oppenheimer has also clearly fizzled out in that endeavor. The most disappointing aspect is the screenplay, which will not give you a sense of excitement at any point as the movie progresses.The movie is brimmed with endless dry dialogues, boring meetings in closed rooms, and frequently veers off into uninteresting subplots. But Nolan was successful in not letting the Oppenheimer character become supernatural throughout the movie.You will be shown the amazing dialogue between officers behind closed doors to discuss which cities they are going to bomb rather than how the dropping of a bomb affected the unlucky cities of Japan in reality. Nolan preferred melodramatic events on the surface to the deeper story nobody knows, which made the plot dull and boring all the way.The continuous saga of office discussions put me to near sleep, and that's when Nolan comes up with very loud music every now and then so that I don't have a chance to have a nice sleep.As a final word, the screenplay was very flat, and I didn't feel excitement at any point. But if you are a fan of endless closed room dialogue and drawing board discussions of making a bomb, this is the movie for you. If you expect some upbeat twists in the screenplay, sit back at your home, grab any book and coffee for a more enjoyable day."
I imagined those people face who went to watch explosion but end up getting their own head explode.I wouldn't recommend this movie to go watch in imax because isn't there anything to watch in imax at all movie is too political and less sci-fi so much tension that will explode your headIf you are expecting a little action then you are going to be completely disappointed like i was. This is first Christopher nolan movie that disappointment me very bad. Soundtrack was amazing all the actors performance was so top notch especially Cllian Murphy and matt damon hands for both of them but this movie totally different from any other Christopher nolan movies to be completely honest it's borring.
"I went to see this movie without any expectations and also hoping it was something different.At first I quickly saw the movie poster, I thought it was a marvel movie. I was like omg excited to see this sci-fi /fantasy kind of movie with fire 🔥 on the background.As I started watching (so excited) the first 30 minutes i quickly became disinterested, what the hell are they talking about for hours and never get to the point. Not only that my gosh the first hour! It was about oppie having sex with a girl and getting a wife! Talking and having sex and talking and having sex. I rather watch porn.I got so stress watching for 3 hours! Worst experience ever. I ate pop corn and i forgot ot buy water! And popcorn was so salty that made me so thirsty! I was so thirsty during the 3 hours of movie plus I needed to pee but afraid to get up (because I don't want to be the center of attention)As the best part of the movie is when they finally test the bomb which i said in my head 'oh my gosh finally! That was the whole point of the movie, isn't it' that last about 30 minutes bombing in los amos whatever they called.Then I thought it was getting better! Believe or not oh hell he got into court then they start talking AGAIN! The whole movie was talking and talking, it should not be 3 hours! It should have been 1 hour movie.I was the only person in the cinema saying out loud 'omg this is so boring and stressful' omg mosquito bites me in the cinema, I was thirsty, I needed to pee as well. And the movie was horribly boring.Tho I believed people worked hard for this film but I'm sorry I probably the only person in this world that don't like this movie. I'm sure everybody loves it. It's me, it's not you. I rather watch Barbie movie."
"I expected more to be honest , I was all hyped up for this film just for it to be 3 hours and I didn't even understand anything , all talk and the bomb just explodes in like 20 minutes or sum , you should never ever mix between future , present and past . That's what he did , Gave it a 7 because filming was good so were the explosions also comedy in it is kinda good , I was happy that it didn't contain CGI , honestly if I watched mission impossible it would be better . I really am sad and that is the reason , after all the hype and they say its gonna be the best film in history,best film of the year,etc..."
"This movie is a long drag, worst film made from Master and Commander.If you expect any special effects or the detonation and impact of the atomic bomb over Japan you will be highly dissapointed. Nolan's worse. There are better documentaries about this subject on YouTube with better special effects. It feels this film was shot on a very low budget using stock imagery of what the wanted to represent an atomic explosion, so save your money for other cinema projections of this year. The movie bombs in all aspects including sound. I see why they released it at the same time as Barbie, could not stand a chance to Mission Impossible and i am not a Tom Cruise fan but that was a good film."
"Hello guys, first of all I'm sorry for my bad English I'm using my translator microphone. Hard to understand because it's going very fast. People who don't know about history, probably won't understand anything about the movie. Some scenes took my breath away.. I cried. At the beginning of the movie, I felt like the whole film is like a trailer. Because 80% of the movie is with background, music and talking. I liked it, but I wish it was a little bit easier to understand the actress also was perfect. Laughter you can see famous actors like from Drake and Josh or Mr. Robot. Have a nice day and sorry for this English."
"The first two hours are fine. By the final hour, the time period had jumped so many times that I lost the plot. As a result, after three hours, we still don't have a sense of who Oppenheimer was.The characters were not developed fully, and I'm wondering why the Robert Downey character was in the film at all. He added nothing to the story.The story was over after the trinity test, but it kept going...and going. And then without telling us why, suddenly powerful DC people are trying to ruin Oppenheimer.The film isn't bad, it just doesn't tell a story that is easily followed. But that's kind of a Nolan trademark."
"The acting and production values are up to Christopher Nolan's standards. Cillian Murphy was a great choice to play J. Robert Oppenheimer - that said, there were long stretches where his deadpan portrayal evoked little emotion (in me) regarding his complex character.If anyone stole the movie, it was Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss. RDJ moved seamlessly through the time shifts and was ultimately perfect as a foil to Oppenheimer. I won't get into any of the rest of the ensemble cast, but they all played their supporting roles quite well.So, why the six star review, then? Even at 3 hours, the film and character development felt incredibly rushed, and there were many aspects to this expansive story that weren't adequately fleshed out. To me, it would have been much more engaging as a 6 or 8 episode biopic mini-series. Oppenheimer didn't need to be IMAX film. The story was about his life's work and personal idiosyncrasies.At the end of the movie, I walked out of the theater to my car & never once said ""wow!"" While it was technically flawless, and was well cast, it never emotionally engaged me. YMMV."
"As an admirer of Nolan's work, I am very disappointed. First of all, the soundtrack sucks, it's just random ""bombing"" sounds that hardly fit in the movie. You can tell it's not Hans Zimmer. Second, it is an extremely confusing movie. It's as if the director had a million different ideas and just mixed them up together in a disorganized, completely random way. The timeline of the scenes is very random and hard to follow. Also, 3 hours was too long and after 2h I was bored. I feel like I just threw away 3h of my life. This movie is a very boring, confusing and soulless mess. I felt no emotion whatsoever from the movie, unlike with Nolan's other works. I wish it was more organized and concise."
"Nothing Christopher Nolan makes is easy to watch. Which I guess is one of his biggest charms, while also being his biggest downfall. You can't just sit and enjoy his movies, you have to surrender yourself to the fact that he wants to make you earn it.This starts with his refusal to make a film with understandable dialogue. Oppenheimer was mildly better than Tenet in this regard. But seriously, if he wants us to have to concentrate and think, at least let us understand what the actors are mumbling, or add subtitles.Having said all that, I'd still recommend seeing this movie once. It is a very good story, brilliantly acted, and incredibly shot. I saw it in a standard theatre, not Imax. But considering 90% of the movie takes place inside, I don't know why you'd need to film it for Imax anyway?As I said, definitely see it once. But probably no need to see it twice...."
"Firstly i would like to say i am not being harsh. I am being completely honest and with that, i think this movie was extremely dull and boring. I should've researched it before hand because i didn't know how dragged out and boring the plot was going to be. It was a type of movie where you have to have a high attention span & just have to be a smart person in general. The movie is based around science & history but the wording and everything about it just wasn't it. I found myself dozing off multiple times and if i'm being completely honest the only part i understood about that movie is when they actually set off the atomic bomb. Other than that it was shocking😂😂😂"
"I went to the movie with an expectation to see a Nolan movie. In Memento, he stimulated our brains to ask questions about human memory, in Interstellar about the dimensions of the universe, time and gravity, in Tenet about time, in Prestige electricity and teleportation, in Inception... you got my point. Even on Batman series, his touch was able to make it the most grounded comic movie and achieve intellectual stimulation.Oppenheimer, could make us think about the structure of the universe, time, space etc... no it's just a good US history and politics movie. The PR to watch it at a IMAX saloon is totally fallacious. IMO, just wait to watch at home on Netflix."
"In this film, the scene where he is shown to be having sex and reading the Gita is totally unwarranted. It is an insult to the Gita and our civilization.So I don't like this film. It has come to notice that the movie 'Oppenheimer' contains a scene that makes a scathing attack on Hinduism. I recommended every Hindu don't watch this Faltu movie.In this film i like every scene but where he is shown to be having sex and reading the Gita is totally unwarranted.I know the film maker work hard but pls don't insult any holi book.So that why i don't like this film and i am not recommended any one to watch the movie."
"Side note: I loved tenet. A spy block buster palindrome. Total mindfuck and most of all. RE-WATCHABLE!!!!!Okay,
I began to realize to realize the underlying unique structures of these films. Dunkirk was literally if you converted a Shepard Tone into a movie. Tenet is really if you converted a palindrome into a movie. And with Oppenheimer, it feels like the whole movie is a bomb. Everything just builds and builds and builds and builds and then the bomb goes off and you still don't feel any release. The real bomb is the ending. It comes full circle.The movie was great. It felt unique, complex, and it shone a light into how complex human nature really is. Death and Life. At the same time. Great storytellers know when to pick a story that has that special something. Nolan truly does has that intuition. He even said in interviews. He heard the story, heard some details. Felt the dramatic nature. And kept investigating.My points on the board have been said, points against would definitely be how the use of nudity felt. It just didn't feel right. That's all I can say. It just felt weird to me. Felt like it wasn't needed. Felt like nudity for nudities sake. The bomb explosion was a little anticlimactic for me because I could feel that the movie wasn't done. So it wasn't a showstopper for me. Doesn't make it bad though. But yeah that's about it.Not being able to keep track of all the characters and details don't detract from the film for me. As I plan to see it again. It only plays to its rewatch ability. Some people say that would be points against. I disagree. Just rewatch the movie. And then watch it again. And then watch it again. And again. And then one more time. And then another time just cuz. Get the point?No? Okay listen to me contrast the following.I want to rewatch Oppenheimer so I can get all the details straight. During my rewatchINGS of this 3 hour film I don't feel like I'm bored at all. In fact, I feel like I have to go see it again!To this,I left Barbie 30 min before the end of its 1.5 hour runtime because I was so bored and I already knew what was going to happen. I left the theatre not wanting to watch it again.Get it? Got it? Good!"
"The new film 'Oppenheimer' by Christopher Nolan premiered in big-screen cinemas worldwide. The biopic by the director, starring Cillian Murphy, has drawn a lot of attention in India as well, particularly for bringing up the sacred text Bhagavad Gita.J. Robert Oppenheimer, a physicist who is credited with creating the atomic bomb, is the focus of the movie. Oppenheimer was the head of Los Alamos Laboratory and a key player in the Manhattan Project, an initiative by the government to carry out research into the making of nuclear weapons.While Florence Pugh portrays Jean Tatlock, Cillian Murphy plays Oppenheimer. Murphy stated that he had read the Hindu holy scripture for the movie before it was released. Unexpectedly, it appeared in an intimate scene in the movie.The sequence didn't sit well with viewers, who questioned the CBFC for allowing the release of this movie without removing a scene that would offend religious sentiments.Source - ABP News."
"Oppenheimer is truly a complex character and it feels and reflects in the Christopher Nolan's adaptation. The film largely works and the 3 hour run time doesn't bother you too much. Acting masterclasses are on display in Cillian Murphy and RDJ and excellent support from Matt Damon.Only gripe is that the film only explores only one side of Oppenheimers character. Some of his real brilliance hasn't been shown at all and assumed the viewer would come prepared.Also the film, even though dark, doesnt quite bring out why the Truman govt tried to defame their national hero at the time. Its probably again left on viewers to educate themselves."
The original was more about the making of the bomb. This movie left out a major part of the movie. Watch the original movie first. Fat man and little boy. I worked with a son of a man that actually worked on the Manhattan project. The acting in this version was good but the story line was not. Please everyone watch the original which most people never heard of. I can't say this enough watch the original I mentioned I think it was made in 1989. Thank you. I hope more people watch the original because of my post. I would never watch this movie again.You will see what I mean. Total disappointment !!!
"Yep, just watched it. The whole 3 hours of it. True, it is a nice film. But man, the first hour there is not even 3 seconds to breathe. Just dialogue over dialogue over new character over new character.That leaves you confused and bored. You are really trying to make sense but some part of you thinks to leave the cinema.I think Mat Damon brought some positive feelings to the film. A little comedy, or a little ""out of order"".Towards the end there are some conclusions, hints of truth, feelings which will fulfill you.But it's not enough. IMAX is not needed at all. Half of the film is B/W."
"Nolan needs to be reeled in by the people around him.While parts of this film were interesting, beautifully shot and thought provoking, others were honestly very boring and felt like filler out of an anime. The whole movie is 3 hours and could be cut to 1.5 hours and could the use an extra half hour about how the atomic bomb works, what the build up to it was (showing the people that warned about Germany's development and the attricities Germany was commiting), and fleshing out Oppenheimers relationships more and himself as a person.The whole part about the trial and some scenes in middle part movie contained some scenes that made me sleepy and had people in the theater (quite rude I have to say but still) yawning loudly and sitting leaning forward to keep themselves awake, sometimes rubbing themselves in the eyes. It's a shame, because this movie certainly has some amazing parts, such as the development of the atomic bomb in New Mexico and the colleges at Berkely leading up to it. Also the communist gatherings in the early parts of the movie were relavant for the small part of the trial that I would keep in and also gave an interesting view into the zeitgeist of facism and communism in the years leading up to WW2.The movie is very hard to rate due to variance in it's quality. However, I simply cannot recommend to watch it in cinema's becuase you would not have the option the fast forward through the sleep inducing parts. Therefore, I have to give the movie a 5/10. Were the movie to be severely cutted so that te good parts remain it would be a 7.2/10."
"So let's start with the good bits: A fascinating story well told and easy to follow despite the usual non linear format of Mr Nolan. I also thought it ended well and had great acting and a brilliant cast. I would have given it more stars had it not been overhyped so much which left me with my expectations too high. Now for the bad bits (with spoilers!): Watching any film on a Cinema big screen with surround sound is a nice experience. However, I am not sure why this film was a 'must see' on a big screen. I am guessing for the overhyped bomb detonation taking place two hours into the three hour film. I was expecting so much more from the detonation sequence, I did not time it, but it seemed to be over so quickly with a flash, fireball and some shockwave bangs. Mr Nolan missed a trick here as he could have made it last so much longer with so many more effects. Then it was back to the slow but well told drama for the last hour. So, with the exception of a couple of minutes in the middle a big screen is no more a required for this film than for a courtroom drama."
"""Openheimer"" was meant to be a captivating exploration of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life and the atomic bomb's development. Unfortunately, it fell far short of expectations. This is not a movie for fans of Interstellar or Inception. This is a very long and very boring movie about a guy in a suit who figured out how to kill other people in an spectacular way. The amount of meetings and discussions going on reminds me of corporate calls on teams. Nolan jumps around timelines. Getting caught up in this maze is difficult and tiring. It was a terrible movie. In the end I left the cinema after two hours."
"Great movie, but with a great fault; not a minor, but a major historical failure to show the central role that president Roosevelt played in the first years of the relevant period. Einstein and others convinced president Roosevelt that Germany was in the process of developing an atomic bomb and it was Roosevelt who decided to launch the Manhatten Project. It was also Roosevelt who sent a letter to Oppenheimer thanking him for leading the successful work in New Mexico. A film about Oppenheimer and the atomic bomb without a role for FDR is like making a film about The Battle of Britain without Winston Churchill.Yours Gideon Zlotnik."
"Just this just as I thought is just another typical world war 2 movie The fascist and the national socialist movements are the bad guys and the Communist are the good guys and we have to help certain group of people
Then we have to end the war by any means necessary and by any means necessary that we had to drop atomic bomb
Just we didn't meant to have destroyed two cities and I have more than hundred thousand people killed and don't get me started with the main character the protagonists Who belongs to the oven he created a weapon of mass destruction and he didn't know that the government will use it to end the war yeah right
Overall long story overacting and the good guys won the war."
"I will keep my review very simple and absolutely honest.The movie is a biopic in its purest sense. Don't watch this movie if you think the Trinity test will be spectacular with great special effects. Nolan tried to achieve the blast with practical effects and that took a major toll on the seriousness of how violent Nuclear explosion can be. Basically there is only one explosion people go to the watch the movie. If someone is telling me they watched the movie just for the Dr. Oppenheimer's pov of life, I would say they are lying to themselves. Everyone on this planet have some philosophy of their own and a sob story. Oppenheimer's doesn't make him any special or more vulnerable than us. That's the essence of life.I did not go to the movie expecting it to be an action flick. Also just because I am a long time Nolan fan doesn't mean I can lie to myself convincing that's it's a spectacular movie. The movie is just blant. Over 90% of the movie is distracting with its cutting and showing different timelines while lacking consistency in story telling. Nolan is know to cut scenes and show past and future back to back without giving the audience gap to breath. This style of screenplay will work only for some movies but not all. I totally understand why Nolan had to do what he did, but it simply didn't workout that well.I am from India, and usually I know when it's a great movie by seeing our Audience reaction. 70% of the seats were full and I thought people would usually blast the theatre with screaming like monkeys do, like we do in all good movies. But this time, I watched a soul-less, exhausted audience. Most of them were not even bothering to stay and give the movie some attention.The other thing I want to talk about it's the sound track. As gorgeous it can be, it's frustrating and irritating to see Nolan using the same Dunkirk theatrics like the playing the foot stomping rail track sound again and again. To summarise what I saw1. A loud monotonous eerie sound track.2. Characters yelling half the time to make the movie look serious.3. A failed Trinity explosion practical effects.4. Too much screentime about the protagonist AEC hearing and potential indictment. (Honestly, who in this day and age would give a damn about how the guy who made the atom bomb coped with Govt Committees for a stupidest reason that he could be potential Communist? I mean, how could the director think people who are watching the film know how big of a deal it is to talk communist ideas in a Capitalistic nation during WW2?)5. An unapologetic scientist in real life, which the movie did a fantastic job to not give a F or care about him and why he had to do what he had to do. Nolan literally failed to make me feel sorry for Oppenheimer. Just, seeing him read a BS sankrit phrase, ""Now I become death, destroyer of worlds"" is meant to convince he is really sorry for killing 210000 people?6. A movie which seriously lacks flow of story telling.7. A 3 hours, loud, serial type of drama.Atleast to do some justice to the people who are about to watch this movie, I would say, try to learning the names of the characters in Oppenheimer's life and how influential they too are. This movie is not for an Average Joe with zero knowledge about scientists and their respective contributions. And the way Nolan introduced them like a high speed train into the movie is seriously bad.All in all, it's a good movie, but not spectacular."
"Title: Oppenheimer - A Misguided Fusion of Themes [⭐]As a movie enthusiast, I approach films with an open mind, appreciating the art of storytelling and the diverse perspectives they offer. Unfortunately, Oppenheimer left me deeply disappointed and disheartened. While it attempted to delve into the life of the renowned physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, the inclusion of an insensitive and inappropriate scene involving the Bhagavad Gita during a sexual encounter was an utter misstep that marred the entire film.The movie itself had the potential to be a captivating biographical drama, exploring the complexities of Oppenheimer's life and the moral dilemmas he faced during his work on the atomic bomb. Regrettably, the film veered off course, resorting to shock value by including a scene that was clearly intended to provoke controversy rather than add any meaningful depth to the narrative.To further exacerbate the situation, the scene in question incorporated the sacred and revered text, the Bhagavad Gita, into an intimate moment. Such a disrespectful portrayal not only trivializes a profound spiritual scripture but also demonstrates a lack of cultural sensitivity. It is crucial to understand that religious texts are sacred to millions and should not be misused for sensationalism or shock factor in any context.As an audience member from the region that the Bhagavad Gita holds significant importance for, I felt deeply offended by this blatant disrespect. It is essential for filmmakers to be responsible and thoughtful about the cultural implications of their work, especially when it involves elements so deeply intertwined with people's faith and beliefs.Despite any positive aspects the film might have had, the inclusion of this offensive scene completely overshadowed them, leaving a bitter taste that is hard to overlook. As a result, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend Oppenheimer to others. It is a shame that the potential for a compelling exploration of a remarkable historical figure was overshadowed by such careless and harmful choices.In conclusion, Oppenheimer had the opportunity to be a thought-provoking and respectful biopic, but it failed to live up to its potential. The inappropriate use of the Bhagavad Gita during a sexual scene has deeply insulted our region and undermined the credibility of the film. I urge filmmakers to exercise caution and sensitivity when handling religious and cultural elements in their storytelling, as such irresponsible decisions can alienate audiences and tarnish the reputation of otherwise promising works of art."
"Going into the cinema I had really high expectations for this movie. The movie lacked the ""amazing special effects"" in where it was loudly marketed, (watched it on IMAX) and because of this, I felt cheated of an amazing visual experience. Another issue I have with this movie was the weird tangling of events, it felt like the movie was trying to show so much, thus making it boring and uninteresting. The actors did great, but that's about it ""great"". I also despised a lot of the cinematography, too many close ups and ""average"" angles. The storyline was okay, acting was okay, cinematography okay."
"If i could give zero i would. Boring, long and waste of money. I was expecting more about how was the bomb designed and how he actually did. But nothing. I understand more from Wikipedia. I'm afraid the film ""Oppenheimer"" fell flat in more than a few areas. The most noticeable issue was the pacing; the movie was an exhausting, drawn-out affair that rarely managed to hold my interest. Rather than focusing on the most poignant parts of Oppenheimer's life and work, it was bogged down in needless minutiae.The characterization of Oppenheimer himself was another major flaw. For such a complex and historically significant figure, the movie offered a disappointingly one-dimensional portrayal. The acting was passable but lacked the depth and nuance necessary to truly capture the essence of this troubled genius.Finally, the storytelling was lackluster. Crucial historical events were glossed over or presented without context, leaving the viewer to grapple with a disjointed narrative that failed to communicate the significance of Oppenheimer's work. All in all, ""Oppenheimer"" missed the mark on several counts and ended up being a disappointing depiction of an otherwise fascinating historical figure."
"Perhaps the first Nolan film that could have potentially benefited from computer-generated effects. Nolan is a master at narrating a visual story through traditional means, but this time the wonder of splitting the atom remained somewhat remote. Traditional explosions and spark showers, created with pyrotechnics, even seemed naive in depicting the incredible power of nuclear fission.The film was long, but not tediously so. The complex navigation of Oppenheimer through the jungle of human relationships and political connections was skillfully executed. The only thing that distracted in the story was the excessive focus on Oppenheimer's interrogations - this could have been trimmed down."
"This film has a few exciting elements, but it is two hours too long. Most of it is just uninteresting talk of boring men. We expected a masterpiece because of the reviews, but definitely wouldnt recommend. There is a clip out there of oppenheimer doing the 'i am become death, destroyer of worlds' wich truly captivates the darkness of the reality he lived and created. This film does not create anything more profound than this clip to be seen on youtube or wherever online. It said it took three hours, but it felt like six. I wouldn't spend time kf money on it looking back. I hope others enjoy it better."
"First of all, I am a big fan of Nolan's works. I like most of his movies and The Prestige remains one of my favorite. I wish I liked Oppenheimer too but the movie came as a big disappointment to me. Probably because I expected to see an epic drama about the intricacies and difficulties of building an atomic bomb (something like The Imitation Game or biopic like There Will Be Blood about personality of Oppenheimer) but instead I saw ""Michael Keaton"" walking around and smoking pipe performed by Cillian Murphy. I like Murphy's other roles, but I don't think this one was his best performance. The moral dilemma Oppenheimer had been going through was not convincing at all in Murphy's play. I didn't see that something was really eating Oppenheimer - Murphy even after he realised the scale of his destructive creation. No obsession with atomic bomb or quantum physics was shown. So disappointing. I wish the role was played by Eddie Redmayne or Benedict Cumberbatch. The movie is unreasonably too long. Too many unnecessary scenes. More than half of the film is devoted to the interrogation with predilection whether Oppenheimer's clearance will be renewed or not. Is it a joke? Was it the most important thing in his life? Really? No chemistry between Murphy and E. Blunt's characters, so it was pretty surprising that they got married. However, I gave the film 6 stars because I absolutely loved Robert Downey's performance. He was stunning from start to finish. Casey Affleck should have had longer screen time. I also think that Florence Pugh's character was underdeveloped. She is so talented and beautiful and could have brought better sense and scenes to the film."
"Hello...I did not watched it in IMAX cause in my city it wasn't available. But I had some better hope in respect of visuals and a powerful story. 2 mins of explosion was great but visuals weren't so impressive after and before that, I mean nothing unusual and story ah..a very very very ordinary story. A very normal story and the plot we have seen many times in many movies.So if you are going with some great expectations which I had you will not be satisfied and it is not the thing you are looking for.Music as usual good as u expect in Nolan movie but one tune was same like every movie of Nolan you will find it.But in the end I want to say that I was not expecting that shallow movie. Normal."
"Both visuals and cinematics where great, also the acting is spot on. You can see Nolan really showed his skills. To be short: a great imax movie without CGI. But it's very long (3 hours) and a lot of time is consumed to intensify scenes, rather than explaining how hard it was to let an plutonium bomb work at critical mass and the accidents with it was not shown. Also the detonation of the device where a little bit underwhelming consider the trailer, besides it's hard to reduplicate without cgi. Some documentaries online are more accurate but as a movie it's great. Also the ""Dutch"" he spoke is not understandable as a Dutch person myself, it sounded more like German."
"Arguably one of Christopher Nolan's worst films. It amazes me that the person who wrote Interstellar and Inception could be so lazy in writing a biopic. The dialogue is atrocious. Character introductions were cliche. The subjective black and white story line was unnecessary. It's tough to make a three hour movie feel rushed and empty but Christopher Nolan managed to pull it off in Oppenheimer. Sadly, it seems as though this Barbie/Oppenheimer scheme Hollywood pulled to get us all back in the theater to see these movies (at least from my perspective) failed. Oppenheimer's only shred of decency is it's use of sound and some scenes cinematography. Outside of that this movie is not worth seeing in theaters."
"The movie was a bit hard to follow the dates(yes black and white scenes helped to follow the different) and I watched all the Nolan's cinema but in this movie there was no impact. I didnt experience that impact I found in the interstellar or in the prestige. Still a great cinematography and great acting's but its not enough for better points in my opinion. The scenes I can call I feel like I was watching Nolan's cinema the ones was after the starting the build the test field and the progress of building the atomic bomb. There I found that tension and impact. Then we saw the regret on Oppenheimer and he tried to change atomic future,there I found the impact I want."
"It was an incredibly boring with a story that's 98% dialogue that leads almost nowhere. It's very hard to follow because they fail to grab your attention enough to care about any of the characters or what's going on in the film.A single bomb went off the whole movie, and not a single scene showing the impact of the atom bomb of the victims in a Japan.To call this movie a movie a documentary is a farce, there are no true accounts survivors or any accurate details, the whole thing was embellished and felt like a larger than life drama that had no plot. Don't waste your time or your money. It's absolute garbage."
"It's a Dialogue heavy Movie, Centered on court room trials with almost no Action, just a single Nuke Scene, which was good enough. Nolan's forte is Action Sci-fi Genre, but here he became more Artistic, trying to Achieve an Oscar. Visuals were great, every actor performed in excellence, Sound score was fabulous and direction as always was superb.But don't go thinking that you'll see the actual Nuke dropped in the Anime Nation, like in ""Grave of Fireflies"", Rather it will give you a more Social dilemma, a 70 year long debate, if it was necessary to drop a bomb and kill Millions or was it just the ego/revenge of the US for Pearl Harbour or was it the only was to end the war and save Billions of lives by sacrificing millions. Definitely it's demands a discussion.Last dialogue of the Movie is the Nail in the Coffin, I will not Spoil it for you. Go watch it in IMAX for an experience. It's a good one time watch, a Documentary. Unlike The Dark Knight trilogy you won't rewatch it again and again.P. S.: Sex scenes were kinda unnecessary, and Movie could have been half an hour shorter."
"If you have enough bucks buy you a nice sandwich instead of watching that boring simulation. The acting is the only thing is good in that movie, I can't even say it's the best but not bad at least . The bang moment was muted, the story is redeculs. I recommend you to get a job and pay taxes instead of watching this . Waste of money, even Super Mario bros better than that,All I can say is recommended you to watch anything better even local Arabic movies like Elboaboa . 3 hours of filling empty stuff. Nudity scenes without any profits. It was born to be bad. I wish there is -10 out of 10 I would be glad to put it."
"The movie was very long. The build up for the bomb was enjoyable, but not significant. Felt like the movie started when the test bomb was exploded. The final sequence after the explosion had some really good scenes. The talk with the president that shows the ruthlessness and corruption of the government and president. The internal conflict Robert had between saying what the people wanted to hear and the feeling that he caused the death of millions. The whole interrogation thing was pretty lame and and the result didn't affect me. None of the characters were very interesting. Strauss was a character that seemed cliché a guy that hates someone and wants to bring him down and has a breakdown saying that the guy is evil and wants the fame and everything. Dr Oppenheimer was also a very average character and probably was the best as well in the whole movie. Not too much focus on the morality of making the bomb as much as it was on the interrogation room.Usually in movies where the character is being trialed or interrogated you would have a an attachment to them and want them to succeed in the trial. The result of this interrogation didn't have any affect at all on me because they threw it out and nothing happened basically. The ending twist didn't really hit the way they thought it would because no one believed Einstein was talking about strauss with Robert. Felt like if we seen this movie in the 60s the plot and the ending would've been much more powerful as really everyone today has nuclear bombs and wars aren't happening. So the crazy chain reaction doesn't feel as powerful as the destruction of the whole world in the future.There was great acting for a lame story pretty much. Loved some scenes, but overall it's really not that great of a movie as I would've expected my main complaint is the story felt a bit uninteresting."
"I had high hopes But it was over. I think it doesn't give much about Oppenheimer's personal life, but a lot about his political life. For which I find the movie boring. And it would have been better if the movie had ended sooner rather than having an episode about politics at the end of the movie.Moreover, the acting of the movie was very good, the casting was very good, but I did not like the story very much. I feel boring because of the repetition of one incident in the movie. And the time of the movie is too much. It would have been better if the movie ended sooner.So It's my Opinion.Thank you."
"It's the first time in years I wanted to walk out of a movie. The fast transitions between scenes tied together with constant background music makes it almost unwatchable. The first 90 minutes felt like going through some IG reel where everything had to be hyped up to keep people interested. Not each and every line the character says has to be epic. Not each and every scene needs epic music building up to create tension. The movie feels flat from this point of view. It keeps running on high octane. Where are the moments of calm that help build up the tension? It's just tension in almost every scene. It feels so unnatural and out of place. The second part of the movie feels a bit better. Robert Downey Jr. Does an amazing job, so does Murphy. It's the pace of the movie that's the problem. I would have had no problem watching this as a mini series like Chernobyl. You would be able to present all of the important information without trying to capture everything in 3 hours and rushing things. It could have been something great. But it's not. 7.2/10."
"The movie was fail to educate people about the process of the atomic bomb, where the source, how it done. A single osciloscope? Come on. Even there was no B-29. Nolan did not want CGI? Thats why it make this move cheap. Even the transporting of the ore has movie, the ship that carry that bomb has a single movie, process dropping it has a movie, I expect movie like unbroken (CGI? Yes but clean)
You know what they use to picture the uranium? Marbels, hahaha. And you know what the bomb was lego. As I know the bomb was solid iron.The movie just expensive camera that shoot over a face like tiktok for 3 hours."
"I like Chris Nolan movies, biopics, and the subject of this movie but score was over the top and gave me a headache. Think people would have been falling asleep if not for the exaggerated score that makes you feel like you're having an anxiety attack for 3 hours. Topic is interesting but more befitting a documentary and would have been way more relevant if someone made this movie in the 80s when cold war and nuclear holocaust were still a concern of people. Felt like they didn't explain Robert Downey Jrs' character enough for him to be the antagonist they used him as. Not a bad movie, just not the masterpiece people are calling it. Kind of movie you may never rewatch."
"Trying to insult the Bagavat Gita by reading it in the middle of a sex screen shows contempt and hatred to Hinduism (though bagavat Gita is a not a religious text (more a philosophicaltest), the intent in the movie seems religious ). The dirty mindset of the maker is obvious and the purpose of movie has shifted from entertainment to brewing hatred towards particular sect of humanity. Either the makers should apologize or the movie should be banned in my opinion.All the money and efforts into making a movie is worthless when the intent fails. I cannot hence appreciate any part of the movie - acting, directing, cinematography, bla bla."
"Christopher Nolan looks more like an indie director making movies in Hollywood. He breaks the traditional recipe of the blockbuster popcorn movie with a plot rather interested in breaking up the story of a WWII character, than in making a story of high intensity and drama, as is the type of Hollywood cinema. I'd say the movie is OKAY, but people and pop culture aren't ready for 3 hours of Oppenheimer getting in trouble for his ""uncertain"" communist party relation, and his bad vibes with his boss.I think it would be better if he had cut it and had kept just the final hour and a half. It would had been perfectly understood.If you havent watched the movie, this might be a great slogan: a Feature Film of a man Struggling with his Colleagues."
"Adding my thoughts while the experience is fresh.I think Nolan is getting tired. This is his 3rd movie in row that is totally lackluster. Dunquerque was just a pointless melodrama, Tenet was confusing, underthinked and rushed, this movie I think is worse than these prior 2 were.Definitely biographical movies are not his thing so it became extremely long, the drawn-out plot was just pointless. Seemingly he wanted to give 1.5 minute stage for every single non-busy Hollywood face and they were eager to have such a blockbuster beside their names. (Yet a positive thing to add is that there was now black-washing, female-washing, goyim-washing attempt here)The movie never got to tell what was its focus: the commie bounds, the political affiliation, personal life, his guilt, his relationship to other scientists of the era? None of these and all of them at the same time.Even with the extremely rushing cuts the movie became a ""bladder-killing"" 210 min long...
Also his guilt was kind of totally odd and the ""evil commission's"" questioning seemed totally legit: why rushing to build a mass destruction tool and 3 years later becoming the advocate against it?Either this or that, but this way they just delegitimised each other.As we say in my first language: One cannot stay virgin and **ck at the same time...Nolad should stay at the sci-fi section because that fits him undoubtly more."
"It was like vanilla ice cream: not too bad and never too good. A very interesting topic, one of the biggest historical event but there was never a great moment in the movie. A very boring take on a larger than life topic. This could have been a movie that could inspire millions.There was potential for several goosebump moment at many different points but it turned out to be a very okayish. Guy on my next sleep was sleeping. I never thought that a movie about bomb can be so bland. I wanted to like this movie but there was never a moment that i would take home.Nolan is just taking significants world war event and turning them into forgettable average movies. After Dunkirk this is strike2."
"Because what I, and assuming most, find it fascinating about Nolan's work is his brilliant ability to tackle the reality by twisting the rarely evoked imagination. Usually after watching a Nolan, I spend days to think about what I experienced and how it is feeding off my own muse. Unlike this, Oppenheimer dissappointingly, is a flat, uninspired, rushed but deadly long movie. Most characters had inadequate acting range. We all know what Cillian's acting range is, honest to goodness, do you think he gives even the half of it? I do not believe that its his inability but the limitations put by the long and non-linear scenario. All those good actors, which i find the casting so overwhelmingly loaded, scattered around the movie to give a five-minute glimpse without any depth.I am used to non-linearity of his scenarios, and enjoy it almost lividly, but this one seems dispersed and disorganised. The scenario must have been divided into different movies even if they wanted to. Oppenheimer and his relation to communist party, oppenheimer and his private affairs, oppenheimer and his academic affairs, oppenheimer and the politics etc. However, audience expected to get all this aspects in three hours in an amorphotic way. This is the reason why it felt so rushed and flat. For example, strauss and oppenheimer's relationship as interesting to begin with. This conexion loosely presented at the beginning which anyway ended up beig the main arch of the scenario. Not the bomb. I find robert downey jr's acting better than most only because his character was enabling him to put some range, he and emily blunt will get an oscar nomination for this same reason and it should be but not the rest. Also, i am failing to understand how florence pugh's name made it to the poster by only less than 10-min screentime while having very little to add the overall story of the movie, even if there is, that connection already made it to story by his relationship with his brother. I find this quite annoying. In contrast, jason clarke (roger robb) portraited a very well constructed acting and feed the main story grandly but not made it to the poster. He should deserved better.Lasst but not least, I find the scene where oppenheimer climb the tower to have a private moment with his bomb, incredibly underwhelming. I believe nolan very well has the ability to put out a twisting scene there to show the duality of a creator and his creation. Rather we saw him under shadows. Not enough. Almost felt like falling of a climactic moment.For all these reasons, the ending left a dry taste in my mouth and overall this movie will stay as a nuisance for me in his filmography."
"If you like biography movies, you gonna enjoy it even though it's a bit long & suddenly gets complicated for no reason other than it's a Nolan movie so it has to be..
One thing I'm sure about is that Oppenheimer will win the Oscar for any sound related Awards..
The visual side of the movie is great and you can tell it's a Nolan movie, so if that's something you like you gonna enjoy it..
For the casting I think Cillian Murphy did a fantastic job he wasn't over the top as some other actors in a biography movies, although she didn't have much screen time Florence Pugh as usual proves to world that she is be the best actress right now.."
"My first review ever. I'm a science savvy person. This was so boring movie. Thanks god there was a good internet signal and I had a sofa seat. I'm sorry for my wife who watched it with me. It was so f* slow, boring, jumping from topic to topic. It was so hard to understand for someone who didn't know the real story and science. Some facts like: the poisoned apple was presented with no context.It was a typical american b*s*it. I'll never claim back lost time. Fortunately I watched it in a country where 2 sofa tickets were super cheap. $10 for 2 sofa tickets. Glad I didn't go to see the other s*it hype: the barbie movie."
"It's really great and important story.The filming and the sound's was so impressive also the cast was perfect
its one of the things that making staying in the movie because i think i know all the actors here in this movie and they did great.So know I will tell you why i didn't enjoy in the movie it's because i was expecting that we will see a lot of explosions and more action but it was literally one scene and it wasn't even in japan they were just trying the atomic boom in the desert and i was expecting that we will see what will happen to the people in nagazake and Hiroshima after the explosion.Anyway I'm sorry for my language because i don't know english so good
and i don't want to use the translator."
"The movie itself: casting, Cinematography, soundtrack- all that was good. As an art-form, yes it was good. However, probably at my fault to watch it, it's a daughting, terrifying and uncomfortable. Most people will say that's the point, but I had no warning how distressing this movie would be. Yes I know , again, ""it's a movie about a bomb, what do you expect"", well
I didn't know how deep this shit would go and how they would interpret certain scenes.As someone who has anxiety this isn't the movie to watch, at all. All of the above applies, but the movie was put on the list to never-ever see again list (with Into The Woods). A warning really would be nice.I had to cover my eyes at a certain scene while sobbing because it was too much.Actually, as I reflect back I would say the movie was long-winded, and the dialogue was lost on me; I wouldn't be able to tell you what happened appart from them making a bomb.My experience after this movie was a panic attack for 5 minutes in the bathroom, worrying about the world and the women on it, and having seen something triggering.Watch this movie if you're a history buff, don't watch this movie if you believe ignorance is bliss."
"...or a TV show in 5 parts.+ Cillian Murphy is amazing, though. He should get an Oscar nomination for this.+ As a non native English speaker, I hate the fact that some of Nolan's movies are a bit hard to understand due to some questionable sound editing choices.+ It is definitely one of Nolan's most conventional movies so far.+ It came to my attention that the upsetting story of Los Alamos wasn't told in its entirety. Apparently hundreds of families living off that land were ressetled and their livestock killed. People living in the surrounding areas got cancer and leukemia in the years that followed. Same happened with the people of color - mostly hispanics - who worked in the area without the appropriate gear.I think Nolan lost a good opportunity to show some of the implications those other Americans faced (and apparently are still facing.) Oppenheimer is portrayed as a victim during the second half of the film, but going beyond his inner circle to show how that whole thing affected other Americans in New Mexico would have benefitted the film greatly. Without that, it's a veeeery long odyssey about a bunch of white men playing god and making questionable decisions, which is fine, but it's 2023 and we can do better, no?"
"When I first heard about the film ""Oppenheimer,"" I was genuinely excited. The subject matter, exploring the life and contributions of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, seemed like a promising premise. However, my enthusiasm quickly turned into disappointment as I endured what can only be described as a dull and misguided cinematic experience.First and foremost, the pacing of ""Oppenheimer"" was excruciatingly slow. The film stretched on for what felt like an eternity, with lengthy scenes that added little to the narrative or character development. The director seemed more interested in showcasing their supposed artistic vision than in creating a coherent and engaging story. The result was a plodding and monotonous narrative that failed to hold my attention throughout its unnecessarily long runtime.Furthermore, the character portrayal in ""Oppenheimer"" was uninspiring at best. While J. Robert Oppenheimer was undoubtedly a complex figure, the film failed to capture his essence and instead reduced him to a one-dimensional and uninteresting protagonist. The script lacked depth and failed to delve into the inner conflicts and moral dilemmas that Oppenheimer faced. As a result, the character felt detached and distant, preventing any meaningful connection between the audience and the protagonist.The supporting cast, unfortunately, suffered the same fate. The talented actors were given little material to work with, and their performances felt wooden and lifeless. It was as if they were merely going through the motions, lacking the emotional depth and nuance necessary to bring the characters to life. This lack of character development left me feeling disconnected and uninvested in their fates.While historical accuracy is not always the most crucial aspect of a biographical film, ""Oppenheimer"" took too many liberties with the facts. It seemed more interested in presenting a distorted version of events rather than providing a nuanced exploration of Oppenheimer's life. The film played fast and loose with the historical timeline, distorting significant events and omitting crucial details. This disregard for accuracy undermined the film's credibility and left me questioning the validity of the story it sought to tell.In addition to the film's pacing and character flaws, the visual presentation was also underwhelming. The cinematography lacked creativity and failed to capture the grandeur and significance of the subject matter. The drab color palette further contributed to the overall dullness of the film. It felt as if the filmmakers had little interest in creating visually striking scenes or memorable imagery, which ultimately made the viewing experience even more forgettable.Lastly, the thematic exploration of ""Oppenheimer"" fell flat. The film failed to engage with the ethical and moral implications of Oppenheimer's work adequately. It barely scratched the surface of the profound questions surrounding the development and use of nuclear weapons. Instead, it seemed content with a superficial examination of the events, leaving me longing for a more thought-provoking and intellectually stimulating experience.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" was a tedious and disappointing film. Its sluggish pacing, lackluster character development, historical inaccuracies, uninspired visual presentation, and superficial thematic exploration all contributed to a movie that failed to deliver on its promising premise. I cannot recommend this film to anyone seeking an engaging and meaningful cinematic experience."
"This was a great film. The writing, characters and acting were fantastic, but I couldn't get over the feeling I was watching a three hour movie trailer.The music was so loud and overpowering I often couldn't hear the dialogue; the scenes were so heavily cut together, there were few pauses in dialogue, no reaction time for the actors to play on and very little time to absorb what they were saying.It felt that I was watching a 5 hour film, hastily cut into a three hour viewing. I almost came out of the cinema thinking ""I'd really like to see that film"".What a shame for a film that is so poignant; a story that hasn't been told on the big screen before, and a subject that everybody should be familiar with.The performances and cinematography were breathtaking; I felt as though I was a living witness leading up to the events that forever changed the world so radically.What a terrible shame it was let down by the most fundamental filmmaking aspects: editing and music."
"Regarding Christopher Nolan,
He has insulted the Bhagavad Gita by depicting it in an inappropriate scene related to intercourse. The Bhagavad Gita is considered a holy book in Hinduism, and it should not have been portrayed in such a manner. This depiction is a disrespect to the sacredness of the Gita. Even though openhimer have taken inspiration from the Gita, there was no need to include it in that particular scene.Nolan should apologize to the Hindu community for using the Gita in such a manner and seek forgiveness from the followers of Hinduism.Say sorry nolan, you can insult gita,Say sorry."
"Nolan's Oppenheimer is a marvelous cinematic experience with stunning visuals, wonderful audio, good pacing and amazing acting performances. However, the film falls short in its underlying theme and story.Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece and should be considered as the new standard in the technical aspect of film making. The overall audio-visual experience that the viewer can experience in a proper IMAX cinema is without a doubt one the best movie experiences ever created. With stunning cinematography and a soul gripping score, I was fully immersed in my theatrical experience from the beginning of the film, right up until after the Trinity launch. As the Trinity launch was the culmination of the build up from the first two hours of the film, I was left wondering how the story would unfold further and what would it entail as we learn more.To my slight annoyance, the third act revealed that the theme, and therefore the lesson of Oppenheimer was, that even the most brilliant minds cannot break from the shackles of governement control and must succomb to the necessities of the society they live in and the power that controls it. And yet, our most estemeed academics can forgive themselves for what they have created due to the fact that if they wouldn't make it, somebody else would and after all they only provide the gadgets, not use them as Truman told Oppenheimer. This theme echoes throughout the film and left a discouraged and sour taste in my soul.As Oppenheimer was working to create his gadget, he was becoming more and more tormented by his own creation and what it would unleash upon the world. As a side note, Murphy has perfected his craft in playing a brilliant, yet tormented soul that draws you in his melancholy and pulls on your heart strings effectively, while still liking the character even through his many flaws. As a I was saying before however, this inner torment of Oppenheimer was not enough to make him stop his work but on the contrary, he pushed on to create the most dangerous deterrant the world has yet to see. The most he did to try to stop the making of these bombs was protest a little against the H-bomb. And even then went on to work on that protect. A brilliant physicist just could not stop working on atomic weapons. Now if that doesn't break down your spirit, I dont know what will. In addition, the sisua of responsibility is bridges of with the simple act of Truman telling Oppenheimer to get over it. As if scientists are not responsible for what their creations do to the world. Add to that the fact that the film demonstrated just how crooked and corrupt the American government is and I just can't make myself feel good about this movie.From a Nolan fan I have to say that this film has the most grim message out of all the Nolan films and while the theme is important especially in these times, it would have been nice if the film would have offered some encouragement as well."
"I wish I didn't see this movie.It was better in my imagination, fantasizing about what it could be.I can't even understand the advertising and marketing pre-release campaign.Both misdirected the average viewer but also the random Nolan's fan (even if they will never admit it).Soundtrack wasn't good.Why do you have to let me know that everything is dramatic with this constant noise in the background ?Is like listening to fake laughs in Friend, put there to remember you to eventually laugh.Storytelling went totally random in the last part, ""the Lewis affair"".Even if actors did a good job, at one point everything become confused.And not for lack of viewer's brain cells, but because of rushed storytelling.The climax to get to Trinity test was nice.But the test itself lacked real tension and visual.David Lynch showed a Trinity test in The Return with way more tension, for a TV show.And probably with the same budget they spent for Emily Blunt's haircut.In a time where people have zero attention span, in the era of Reels and TikTok, is a big gamble to make a 3 hours movie.It is also refreshing to see something like that, since we lack good movies.But, out of this context, Oppenheimer is nothing special.And is quite hard to admit it.I am sure it will get Oscar here and there, prizes everywhere, but it won't matter."
"Oppenheimer Review (that absolutely nobody asked for):Acting 10/10
Directing 8/10
Script 3/10
Pacing 8/10
Structure 4/10
Emotion 3/10
Story 2/10Wonderfully acted out piece of propaganda.Matt Damon & Benny Safdie really stood out to me amongst the all star cast. Stellar performances.Cillian Murphy was hypnotizing to watch as always.RDJ will almost certainly get an Oscar nod.The talent in front and behind the screen did a fantastic job of drawing in the audience, I was on the edge of my seat half the movie!How did almost no other character in this entire film have any sort of negative feelings about the bombs dropping in Hiroshima & Nagasaki whatsoever, except for Oppenheimer. Nobody blinked an eye when they mentioned Pearl Harbor, and when news hit that Hitler invaded Poland all they said was ""You've been upstaged."" No emotion. Pathetically unrealistic.David Kromholtz had one of the only characters who felt true this whole movie.The movie painted Oppenheimer out as a martyr, and Truman (Gary Oldman) as the button man, which is just historically wrong. They literally brought Oldman in just to sell the biggest lie of the whole film.""It wasn't you, it was me.""Not a single mention of his occult involvement nor his influence and decision to drop those bombs.Lastly, because of what this movie both opened and closed with, the black & white narration of the film, it would seem be more pertinent to title this film:
The Hearing of Levi Strauss or something similar.A few masterful scenes cannot make up for this intentional catastrophe. Very disappointing.6/10."
"Although the movie itself without considering the content was incredibly written and directed as a ""Christopher Nolan"" aficionado, Christopher why Oppenheimer? There could be at least a thousand more topics with that brilliant mind of yours worked on. Besides , I didn't like the fact that Einstein wasn't considered much in the movie , although don't know about their history much. Due to the fact that Einstein is way more known to the world and his inspirations were unprecedented that could make the movie more exciting at least for fellow Americans. In sum I disagree with the movie's title and the inventor of the ""Bomb"". Cheers."
"The story of Oppenheimer is told in Nolan's way - with a great set of actors, non-linear screenplay, and overly done background music. Of course, the tunes taken out of the context would sound great. But they are less enjoyable in a movie laden with conversations.At this point, hiding behind the ""need of the story"", heavily cued background music together with whisper-like conversations is becoming Nolan's notorious habit. With the anticipation built for the movie, the audience has at least some familiarity with the story and the characters involved. Were the conversations not meant to be heard or is it a cheap trick to keep us talking about the movie?While the non-linear style makes the story fascinating, the signature recklessness with the audio continues, almost becoming vulgar this time."
"First off, I like Nolan's movies to varying degrees. My favorite is the Batman trilogy, although I do fast-forward through the end of movie 1 (if I recall), as it's too violent. As for this movie:
First, in the coming attractions, it had the words ""we saved (or we're saving) a million soldier's lives"" and from what I remember, that comment wasn't in the movie (and it's important to understand in the context of bomb). Also, many times I couldn't understand the dialouge because the background music/noise was too loud and/or the words sounded distorted. I ended up going to the lobby and they did turn the volume down a little (they said they couldn't turn it down any further - were they under orders to have it only at a certain sound volume level?). I was totally confused about all the Washington D. C. hearings. Why SO MUCH TIME taken on this and the whole ""commie""/""noncommie"" stuff? Are there those in the audience who DIDN'T know that creating the first nuclear bomb and dropping it on Japan was very a controversial thing and that at the tiime we had a communist threat too? Was the Downey character in the movie just to provide an antagonist? I twice looked at my phone to see the time and midway through, I walked to the lobby for a break. Oh, and Nolan should've used special affects for the ""big event"". Everyone knows that an A-bomb has a very distinct mushroom cloud."
The captures are great. Scenes are shoot perfectly. But the plot could be much better. If you expect a movie about a physicist in the process of developing a bomb thats not it. Its a film about politics and the reputation problems generated by running a secret project under the World War II.The captures are great. Scenes are shoot perfectly.

"Oppenheimer, directed by Christopher Nolan, is a film that falls disappointingly short of its potential. While it attempts to delve into the intriguing life and contributions of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the renowned physicist and key figure in the development of the atomic bomb, the execution of the film leaves much to be desired. Here are a few reasons why Oppenheimer fails to deliver on its promise.First and foremost, the pacing of the film is sluggish, making it difficult for the audience to fully engage with the story. The narrative unfolds at a leisurely pace, often getting bogged down in unnecessary details and lacking a cohesive structure. As a result, the film struggles to maintain momentum, leaving viewers disinterested and disconnected from the subject matter.Moreover, the screenplay of Oppenheimer leaves much to be desired. The dialogue often feels forced and contrived, lacking naturalness and authenticity. The interactions between characters lack depth, and the exchanges fail to evoke genuine emotion or intellectual stimulation. As a result, the film feels flat and fails to fully explore the complex themes and ideas it aims to tackle.Lastly, the editing and overall structure of the film contribute to its mediocrity. The transitions between scenes are often abrupt and disjointed, hindering the flow of the narrative. Additionally, certain sequences feel unnecessarily prolonged, while others are hastily wrapped up, resulting in an uneven pacing that disrupts the film's coherence.In conclusion, Oppenheimer falls short of its potential due to its sluggish pacing, shallow character development, lackluster cinematography, weak screenplay, and flawed editing. While the subject matter holds immense intrigue and potential for a captivating film, this particular rendition fails to engage and inspire its audience. Despite its aspirations, Oppenheimer ultimately proves to be a lackluster cinematic endeavor.1/10."
"I tried too much to like this one, but I couldn't at all and I don't even see the point, why they kept talking about shooting the whole movie by Imax cameras ? .. It's not an action film and 'it's not visually impressive at all, and all this talk about the Imax camera and the perfect seats to experience the movie seams so funny now after watching it.(Side note)
most of the audience seemed not to care what's happening after about an hour in the movie and just started scrolling on their phone till something more interesting happens.By far my least Nolan film
Incoherent and very underwhelming
6/10."
"Absolute TRASH, total waste of time, save your money, go watch barbie, must be way better than this one.Nolan I want my money back.Title: ""Openheimer: A Cinematic Catastrophe""I hope you don't take it personally, but ""Openheimer"" is quite possibly the most dreadful movie I've ever had the misfortune of watching. From start to finish, it was an unmitigated disaster that left me questioning the very nature of filmmaking and how this monstrosity ever saw the light of day.The plot, if one can call it that, is an incoherent mess of random scenes and inexplicable occurrences. I couldn't discern a clear storyline if my life depended on it. It felt like the filmmakers were trying to be profound and thought-provoking, but instead, they delivered a pretentious jumble of half-baked ideas that left me more confused than enlightened.The characters in ""Openheimer"" are as lifeless as a sack of potatoes. I had absolutely no emotional connection to any of them, and their motivations were about as clear as mud. It's as if the actors themselves were bewildered by the script and had no idea how to portray their poorly written roles. Watching their lackluster performances was a painful exercise in endurance.The direction and editing were so haphazard that I couldn't tell if the film was going backward or forward half the time. Jump cuts and awkward transitions were used in an attempt to be edgy, but they only succeeded in making the film feel like a choppy mess. It's evident that the filmmakers were aiming for an avant-garde approach, but instead, they achieved a level of incompetence rarely seen in cinema.The cinematography in ""Openheimer"" is nothing short of an eyesore. It's as if the director of photography had never operated a camera before and decided to experiment during the actual shoot. The result is a visual nightmare of poorly framed shots, out-of-focus scenes, and an overuse of shaky cam that made me queasy.As if the cinematic abomination wasn't enough, the soundtrack added insult to injury. The music, if you can call it that, consisted of discordant noises that assaulted my ears and made me wish for the sweet sound of silence. It felt like the composer was playing a prank on the audience, trying to see how much auditory torture we could endure before walking out of the theater.""Openheimer"" is a prime example of filmmakers trying to be ""artsy"" and ""intellectual"" without having a clue about storytelling or the craft of filmmaking. It's a slap in the face to moviegoers who expect even a modicum of coherence and entertainment value from a film. This cinematic catastrophe should be avoided at all costs, and I can't help but feel sorry for anyone involved in this embarrassing disaster, from the actors to the crew who wasted their time and talent on such an appalling project. Save yourself the agony and find something else to watch-anything else would be a step up from ""Openheimer."""
"When you see that this movie was made by Christopher Nolan and the whole impressive cast you think that you will see best movie of this year .. but what I saw was unexpected and overrated movie unfortunately, 3 hours is too long to this story.Christopher Nolan Said better to see the movie in IMAX screen .. naaah it's enough to see it from your phone screen.Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Rami Malek they deserve better story than this one, I think Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey gonna win some prizes for there legendary performance.Overall that movie is overrated, under expectations and disappointing."
"Had it not been for the nudity, I would have loved this movie. So disappointed in the decision to lower such standards for trashy scenes. We can understand that people are nude without actually having to view it. Several of us saw the movie together and agreed the nudity was completely uncalled for. Don't we get enough of society trying to shove that junk down our throats? Just adding to the problem of too many hormones running around to the point of affecting children and all the human trafficking problems. So disappointed in this film and it's director and producers. It could have been such an amazing film."
"I want to love this movie as much as I do the other Nolan films, but I can't quite get there. First off, the acting is incredible, it does feel like a period piece, and the cast is A++. True to its name, this is really a film about Oppenheimer's life, with all the good and bad included. It does a very good job of showing the existential issues related to the bomb, and it is a heavy film in the way you would expect.But there are some places where things could have been improved. First, the film is LONG, like really long. While everything is rightfully included for a reason, this film does not have the same rewatch value that other Nolan movies have. In the last part of the movie it feels like Nolan is kind of rushing to wrap things up, which I didn't appreciate. There's some pretty unnecessary nudity, which feels really out of place in a Nolan movie. I get that we need to explore all of Oppenheimer's life, but you can include that without being so explicit. The movie is an intellectual endeavor and takes some brainpower to watch, and while other Nolan films are this way, this one somehow feels different.The trinity test is insanely cool though, and worth seeing in IMAX. Certainly a film for cinephiles, and like I said, the acting is superb with beautiful, expertly crafted sets. Overall, very good, but just so long and heavy."
"I didn't like this movie.There was too little theory to call it interesting or science popularisation - something I really liked in Interstellar.There was a number of factual mistakes, actually unacceptable for a historic movie.There was background music throughout the entire film, which gave it a dramatic effect. Though, to my taste - if you get to the point to require music to give the dramatic effect, your story is weak.There was this nonsensical timeline back and forth, where the most recent time was shot, for whatever reason, in black and white - I don't even care why, I just didn't like the the timeline hops.Ultimately and most severely, the glorification of making and using a mass killing bomb - regardless of the intentions of the creators, philosophical dilemmas that haunt them later, catchy lines thrown around by literally everyone in the film - is atrocious and barbaric.Especially during the scene of preparation for the final test, I would like Nolan to show the peaceful citizens of Hiroshima, who didn't know that their days were last, and nothing that they did actually mattered, because they would've been blown up by these scientists.Overall: Terrible story, bad visuals, decent play by a load of very strong actors, distracting music, too much of Cillian Murphy closeups, factual errors, no moral balance.I wish I hadn't spent time I watching this."
"As an admirer of Nolan, I came into this movie with big expectations. While it had its merits, I couldn't help but feel disappointed.What I expected to be the biggest and most pivotal scene in the movie, and probably the most anticipated was The Trinity Test explosion. The tension in waiting for the sound of the explosion after already seeing it, was immense, and gave viewers an understanding of just how far they had to be to not be hurt by this new weapon, but the actual sight of the explosion simply wasn't enough, there was no grandiosity, it didn't feel like I was watching and explosion that would go forth and change the world.Nevertheless, the glimpses into the mind of Oppenheimer were truly captivating, offering tantalizing insights into his brilliance and complexities. However, I wished there were more of these moments to fully immerse myself in the genius of such an extraordinary figure.The film had incredible acting performances, with each character(my favourites being Matt Damon and Emily Blunt). However, the narrative failed in providing sufficient backstory for viewers less familiar with the historical context of the physics setting, scenes like meeting Heisenberg, or Bohr arriving at the Los Alamos, felt lost on certain viewers.The movie had a documentary-like quality, rich with information, yet I found myself yearning for more context and clarity. It felt like an opportunity to learn, but somehow missed the mark in providing a cohesive educational experience."
"Movie does not live up to the expectations. I watched it with great anticipation that it will be a fun mind blowing movie that lives up to the core of openhimer's life. To talk about the movie the build up upto the bomb test scene is amazing and the hype gets real, but the sound comes too late and kills the vibe. It was good to delay the sound but the director delayed it too much. Robert Downey Jr's character was amazing and his revelation as antagonist was terrifically amazing. Well his character only made the second half good, props to the writer! . when openhimer's character was being interrogated the hype was building up and died down at an instant which was a source of another disappointment. Worst thing about this movie was that unnecessary sex scene. It certainly seemed like the director wanted to reduce the significance of the holy scripture Bhagvad Geeta's significance from openhimer's life. He must have done it to not show himself as a Hinduism promoter. It was certainly the worst way possible. I have to say it was a waste of money. So I rate it 1 star. This movie is only running because of Christopher's reputation. So,Reducing 3 star will be the actual rating for this movie."
"""Oppenheimer."" like previous Nolan's films, the screenplay was ingeniously crafted in a non-linear format, challenging the audience to piece together the narrative puzzle seat.The explosion trial scene, undoubtedly the movie's highlight, which left me on the edge of my seat.However, for me personally ""Oppenheimer"" leaned heavily towards a documentary-like experience. While this approach might be lauded by some for its historical accuracy and attention to detail, for me personally, it detracted slightly from the overall cinematic experience I have come to expect from Nolan's works. I was hoping for a more seamless blend of historical events with his trademark mind-bending storytelling.Overall ""Oppenheimer"" was a good movie, but it fell short of making it to my list of favorite Nolan films. The explosion trial scene alone makes it a memorable watch."
"Oppenheimer starts switching between past, present and somewhere in between from the get go. As a result the first hour is a chaotic, weird paced struggle to get trough.Then Matt Damon's character gets introduced and the movie starts to become more streamlined and interesting. Too bad it returns to the boring, weird paced style in the last hour.Most of the characters were well acted but i didn't feel any investment because of the boring dialogue and story. I wasn't rooting for a single character.Boring dialogue got mixed with tense music which just felt off. Overal quite boring and a let down."
"This show could've been great. It was great, don't get me wrong. It tells a story, truly amazing. Leave out the sex, leave out the f bombs and you have a decent show. It was not needed. It added nothing to the movie. People left because of the sex. The cinematography was beyond amazing. The acting amazing. I love Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon. I did want to see more of the actual bombing and I always want captions when I'm at the theatre. The sound effects were so loud. There were a few things I didn't follow that I had to look up later that I wished that had explained more fully. All in all it was a great movie."
"Boring movie
Don't recommend.""Oppenheimer,"" the much-hyped historical drama, directed by a renowned filmmaker, has been making waves in the cinema world. With an abundance of positive reviews and high ratings, the film has been hailed as a patriotic masterpiece. However, after experiencing the movie firsthand, it becomes apparent that the praise is far from justified. ""Oppenheimer"" suffers from significant flaws that undermine its historical integrity, and while it does offer some valuable insights into history, it fails to captivate the audience's attention, ultimately proving to be a disappointing and time-wasting endeavor.The primary issue with ""Oppenheimer"" is the authenticity of its content. While historical dramas often take creative liberties to enhance storytelling, this film goes far beyond that, bending and distorting historical facts to suit its narrative. This reckless approach to history raises concerns about the film's integrity as an accurate portrayal of the events surrounding the Manhattan Project and the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer. By misrepresenting key events and personalities, the movie strays from being a reliable source of information, which is a significant drawback for those looking to learn more about this crucial period in history.Another glaring problem with ""Oppenheimer"" is its reliance on misplaced patriotism. Rather than delving into the complex and morally ambiguous aspects of the story, the film chooses to paint Oppenheimer and his team as unflinchingly heroic figures, all in the name of fostering a sense of national pride. This shallow portrayal not only disrespects the nuances of history but also reduces the characters to one-dimensional stereotypes, robbing the audience of a more profound emotional connection with the story.Despite its lack of authenticity and overemphasis on patriotism, ""Oppenheimer"" still manages to provide a few valuable history lessons. The movie offers glimpses into the scientific breakthroughs and challenges faced during the development of the atomic bomb. Moreover, it sheds light on the ethical dilemmas that plagued the scientists involved in the project, grappling with the consequences of their inventions and the devastation they could bring upon humanity. These insights into history are undoubtedly enlightening, but they come at the expense of a coherent and engaging narrative.Regrettably, the movie's failure to captivate its audience is its most damning flaw. Clocking in at an excruciatingly long runtime, ""Oppenheimer"" struggles to maintain a compelling pace. The lack of a cohesive plot and the meandering storytelling make the movie a tedious watch. Even the most dedicated history enthusiasts may find it challenging to stay invested in the film's plodding narrative, further compounded by its artificial and superficial approach to character development.While the film's production values are undeniably impressive, with stunning cinematography and convincing period settings, these technical achievements cannot compensate for the movie's underlying issues. A visually captivating film is only as good as its story, and in the case of ""Oppenheimer,"" the lackluster plot undermines its aesthetic appeal.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a disappointing movie that fails to live up to the hype surrounding it. Its inauthentic portrayal of historical events and reliance on shallow patriotism detract from its credibility as an educational piece. Moreover, the film's slow pace and lack of engaging storytelling make it a tedious and time-wasting experience for many viewers. Despite the movie's few redeeming qualities, such as providing insights into historical facts, it ultimately falls short of delivering a compelling cinematic experience. If you're looking for a genuinely enriching and enjoyable historical drama, ""Oppenheimer"" may not be the best choice."
"I am a pretty big Chris Nolan fan, but in my opinion he tried to ""Memento"" this film too much when it didn't need that approach. The editing was confusing and didn't really add a lot of value. The music was also very dramatic and it was not mixed well. Often times the music over saturated the dialogue. Too Chris didn't use Hans Zimmer! The acting and storyline was very good. Every actor did a superb job, but unfortunately their work was overshadowed by the confusing editing on my opinion. I gave this movie a 6, mostly for the acting. It's not a movie a will watch over and over again like Inception or Dark Knight."
"To be fair I had a bad seat stuck in the corner. Also, there was something with the audio in the film or theater. I couldn't make out parts of the dialog over the background/scene noise.Too much time spent on Oppenheimer himself, wanted to know more about the other scientists. Political intrigue bores me. Should have spent more time on the women in his life or don't cover it at all.Could have watch a 3-hr movie of scientists in a room talking the theory and math of quantum physics even if it was just the surface level stuff I already know.I took Matt Damon's advice and left after the trinity event."
"Is this the generation of fimemakers we have to depend on in terms of critical perspective on our government? In the end it is the same old male valorizing story Hollywood has been producing since its inception.From the beginning the film tries to engage by rolling through what might be considered Oppenheimer's epic academic life. Anyone unfamiliar with that background might be left behind. What might keep the audience engaged is the overwhelming feeling that something is about to happen, like a narrative, but it never really does. There is too much pastiche. There are too many assumprions made about the audience's ability to care about Oppenheimer. The science is glossed over in favor of dreamscapes of atoms.No standout performances. The intricacies iof the science and what is at stake with the Russians is muted. No one has any humor, pathos or humanity. They are all just waiting for the end.This behind the scenes look at the machinations of academia, science, military, and government could have used some commentary from the common man/soldier to balance its insular take on the period.If you want to see what true critique of America/American government looks like, watch The Good Shepherd."
Can't get past the gratuitous nudity and sex. Give me one good reason for it in the conference room interrogation scene?This is toxic masculinity movie making to the extreme. This movie perpetuates women as flawed side notes. I had to search on the internet afterwards to learn about the women involved in the Manhattan Project. It certainly wasn't depicted in this movie except on a miniscule level.It's evident there was a huge amount of passion and talent given to make this movie but the gratuitous sex and nudity were a total distraction and I would ask the director and the female actors what was trying to be achieved in their limited roles.
"Nice good. It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't said before?

"Went to see oppenheimer imax this morning, couldn't make it through 5 minutes of the previews because I thought my ear drums were going to rupture from the dangerously loud level of sound. Even previews of people just talking was causing me hearing damage I didn't want to wait for oppenheimer to start and find out what a nuke sounds like and burst my ear drums. This was the stupidest thing ever, there is no reason to play a movie at that volume, I couldn't even tell you a single preview I saw because I was just thinking about how loud it was and the hearing damage it was causing. 6 hours later now and my hearing is still diminished because of 5 minutes of this. Shame on you Imax, I hope this doesn't cause permanent hearing loss."
I was very hyped about this movie but I'm somewhat disappointed. I found this movie more focused on the bureaucracy. It could have been more focused on the scientific part like the inventions of physics during this project. I also believe many important scientists who contributed in this project were not highlighted along with the research part for the test. Also this movie was not thought provoking much as compared to other Nolan movies. I cannot help it but comparing this movie with Parmanu movie of Bollywood and I found Parmanu more exciting than Oppenheimer. Felt like this was made in rush. Sorry.
"Don't watch! Sheer wastage of money. Only lawyers might like this film. Christopher Nolan please retire gracefully than making mediocre films like these! Whatever was good was shown in the trailer nothing new. Switching between black and white was stupid. Was not hooked to it in the first few minutes. First two hours were really draggy and slow. Atomic explosion, has so much expectations from that shot, but it was just average. My nephew slept through the film (who has never done that till date).Sound design absolutely below average. That stupid foot tapping played 100 times. Too much back and forth and unnecessary details in the film. Should have been named Documentary about Oppenheimer !"
"The movie is little slow / long, lacks the quality of screenplay / dialogue which is hallmark of Christopher Nolan and Cillian Murphy movies 🎥. The the absence of powerful language and emotions doesn't provide a fair opportunity to properly exhibit the acting talent of Murphy. If, one goes, with quality and content of Peaky Blinders, he will be disappointed. Over all a good and worth watching movie to understand this important character/event in history. Resemblances can be found between Dr. Oppenheimer and Dr. A. Q. Khan of Pakistan. They restored his honour partially in 1963 and finally in 2022 when his security clearance withdrawal in 1954 was revoked."
"Christopher Nolan used to be able to be counted on for delivering high quality, thought provoking, educated films that never ventured into the explicit (be it sex, nudity, or language). The majority of his previous films were standards of excellence, always looked forward to, and never required audiences to worry about what content they were about to see. I think many Hollywood professionals underestimate the amount of viewers who filter entertainment they see by their individual moral codes and consciences. Great storytelling (especially in writing) should be able to be portrayed without relying on the explicit. Would have loved to have been a Oppenheimer fan, but unfortunately Nolan has excluded viewers like myself from his latest film."
"Did not love it but definitely liked it.... Not at all a Nolan movie.. More like Aaron Sorkin film... Quite similar to Social network, trial of Chicago seven, and Mollys game.... Oscar nomination for Adapted screenplay and supporting character for RDJ... Nolans easiest accessible movie where nothing of the story is left for audience imagination.....just for the sake of complexity, non linear storytelling seems to be adopted... Still quite enjoyableFor bgm sake one should watch it in theatre.... Otherwise OTT also fine...Lot of dialogue with lots of characters, mostly from physics and chemistry books 😜😜"
"I rarely write a review ..but this time i couldn't resist staying a side without expelling my feeling after seeing the movie..i left the Sal in the mid of the movie...the movie is 3h i barley could sit & hold back in my seat for 1.5h..deadly boring..one of the very few movies that left the movie in the middle ...
Oppenheimer and the script in general is very stretched...the 1st 1.5h could summarize it into 10 min max....the development of the main characters very slow..and evolves meaningless crap love stories that doesn't contribute by anyway to the plot..
stay away & Save your 3h boring time awaiting you."
"I am an avid movie viewer and have a long history and passion for cinema. I've watched several of Nolan's films in the past and have on the whole enjoyed them.When I first saw the trailers for and heard about Oppenheimer I was very excited as it seemed like it had the potential to be a true masterpiece. And while the movie wasn't bad, it wasn't what I was hoping for.First of all my praise for the film. The acting was superb as both Murphy and Downey displayed incredible talent and emotion on screen and all the rest of the cast echoed this. The cinematography was beautifully done and the musical score complimented it well.My main issue with this film consists in the storytelling and writing of this film. There were far too many parts that dragged on and contributed little to nothing as far as the whole story and would've best been removed. As well as sections that were completely unnecessary and or not tastefully done (such as Oppenheimer's continuous infidelity throughout the film). On the other hand there were parts that I believe should've been added so as to clarify certain aspects of the latter half of the film and bring more emotional cohesion.Honestly during the film I was wondering about the time (a very rare occurrence) throughout the film.Additionally, I have read other reviews which have been under the assumption that history buffs or people who are interested in the field are even more likely to enjoy the film. I can attest to the fact as not entirely true, as I myself am studying history currently in university and my love of history didn't sway my issues with the film or enhance it, but viewed it, simply, as I would any other film (that is just for the benefit of the reader to see where my perspective may lie).As a final thought, Oppenheimer was a good film that I was expecting much more from and let me down in many ways but still exhibits shining qualities. I went away from it feeling very little and don't think I would either recommend nor dissuade someone from watching it."
"Atomic breakthrough is not shown but kept behind the curtain, which only keeps you assuming of what happens actually happens from periodic conversations between scientists and etc. Doesn't show the horrors of atomic consequences. I wanted to see him being tormented emotionally after seeing what happened in Japan and etc. Deep political film, focusing on military mid WW2 and post WW2 drama typical pursuits of Americans after Russians/communists with it's deep paranoia which lingers till date. Oscar worthy by a lead actor but a let down overall, knowing Nolan this is second best after Tenet!!!!!"
"At the beginning, I think that most people thought that this movie is about the nuclear bomb and there will be many explosions, and I am one of the people who thought that there would be explosions, because of the marketing and the hype in this film were saying this, but it is very logical that there will be no explosions other than the experimental explosion unless Oppenheimer Participated in the war but he didn't, I may not like biographical films much unless I am interested in the person, and in Robert Oppenheimer's life I am more interested in the nuclear bomb. Perhaps if the movie was about the nuclear bomb and focusing on it, it would have been better, i missed the first 10 minutes of the film but the beginning was normal for me like any other biography, I like the conflict with his life , with jean and his friend and kitty, and the interior conflict that caused after they dropped the bomb in Hiroshima, This shows you the act that comes with regret later on, The climax in this film was so powerful and touched me and deserved to watch it on 70mm IMAX screen but only this scene d: ,The speech scene after they dropped the bomb, After that there was an inner struggle scene that Nolan showed us visually in a very cool way, i see that 3 hours is a lot for this film , it could be better than that in my opinion, the cinematography and the soundtrack ill not say anything about it i mean it's so good ofc, the editing style i didnt like it so much and i feel like it's messy, And I think Nolan is obsessed with time and decided to use editing to play between past, present and future, it's not like the editor is bad or something no but i felt this method didn't work with me, When I missed the 10 minutes, I felt that I had missed something because i didnt understand what happened when they went to the B+W , so I started thinking about what I missed, and then at the time I was thinking about, the future tense appeared and I said holy shit wtf is this, and I missed the time while thinking about what i missed but i got it quickly because I know Nolan he loves to play with time , but i think people don't know him they will take a lot longer to realize what is happening.Overall i liked the film and deserved to be watched especially if you interested in Oppenheimer's life or if you are a filmmaker."
"When there was nothing left to sell in the cinema, they started to put forward the imax wave. Yes, they are right, after all, this is a commercial event.I think there is absolutely no point in going to the movies for a man who has a beautiful 55 inch OLED TV at home and an average sound system.The cinema event is coming to an end, in time it will become an event like theatre.In the middle of the heat in 2023, folks, come on, go to the movies, watch imax, this dialogue movie is a complete trader's head.Nolan the audience has officially replaced the goods, there is no point in watching this movie on imax.If I was a loyal follower, I wouldn't even want to hear Nolan's name again."
"I love Nolan's movies. I love iMax, we have one iMax theatre in my country and I have to go see his movies there. I also happen love history.Theres always a but.Over 3 hours of runtime. There was literally an hour of BS that should have been cut. History-wise a lot of things were correct, but there were also so many cheap palm face-moments. Those who've seen it knows what ""I think we did it"" or ""one young senator"" -scenes I'm referring to.Only NICE iMax scenes. Whit the subject, there was potential for a LOT more. Waste of iMax.Boring, messy, badly paced. Without Nolan.. 5/10. Sorry :/"
"I was told I was seeing the Barbie film tonight. Apparently my ""friends"" tricked me. I was about four hours into this when I said to myself ""wow they not only made Ken super smart, but the focal point of this entire thing.""
I have never heard him referred to anything besides ""Ken"", so I assumed he just had some sort of Nordic/Germanic/Jewish heritage that Matel didn't tell us about. Thought I'd see a lot more hot pink colors, but this sadly was mostly black and white or just close ups of the bright yellow sun. Not bad though.Was gonna give this one star because of no Margot Robbie but I gave it two as a kudos to my friends clever ruse."
"The movie was fine honestly not my favorite. While the elements such as costumes, sets, and cinematography are amazing and done very well I think the movie is half baked. At many points I wish they would show less of something and show wayyyy more of something else. Definitely wish we saw more of the bombing. If you are someone who is into ""films"" or interested in this part of history definitely recommend watching but for just a causal viewer I personally wouldn't recommend. Also the never ended celebrity cameos sorta took me out of the illusion. Josh Peck being in the movie is so unserious. The sex scenes are not that intense but definitely a skip for young viewers."
"Nolan is done. I just can't understand why people like this piece of 'history', full of dark, ugly, polotical setup. If Nolan likes it, fine, enjoy it yourself. Why do you spend 3 hours to torture audience with showing such ugly world with full of stupid politians?I can't understand what people want to enjoy from this movie. Performance? Unfortunately, no...Murphy is just showing his pale and innocent face, and Downey is still the 'Ironman'. Music? No, it is even worse than Tenet. Maybe I can blame the cinema as it was too loud. However I can see the guy sitting next to me throw his popcorn out when the music came out! Storyline? Come on, it is purely the history, you don't even need a Nolan's twist. What else? What else you want to enjoy?So depressed!"
"As an Indian adult this movie is great or kinda good for me ,but the nude part of film is really unnecessary
And movie makers can skip it and Shelby said he read bhagwat Gita for his movie ....for what he read for that kind of stupid stuff... I'm not happy for that scene ...and some where I'm unable to connect with Einstein...and Robert Downey Jr......... And I'm giving 7 star for the way the movie was directed by Nolan sir and performance and the voice artist.... Basically the reason made me said good to this movie is like the time line ....like 3 time line is going on this movie....this movie is not for immature audiance.....this part I like the most so I give it like 6 or 7 star."
"Acting, Production design is good but they gave too much hype for the movie since I expected good VFX such as in Interstellar, Inception, Tenet etc.In the movie, reading the Gita quote during an intimate scene is VERY BIG INSULT to the sentiment of Hindus, not only in India but throughout the world. If it would have been Bible or Quran, would they include it in the scene? Never, because their religious sentiments get hurt (Irony!!)Didn't expect this from Chris Nolan. He is my inspiration and hero for his ultimate dramatic and visually baffling movies but his character is degraded to such an extent that he wrote the screenplay for THAT scene in such a manner.Let's fight to remove that intimate scene from the movie all over the world!!!"
"Acting was tremendous and the true story behind it is a pot of gold. But I felt it was way too long. Could have been 1.5hr easily. It's like the Editor had all these great scenes and at the end decided to keep them all in. Also there was a lot of minute detail about the political history, yet not enough for a history buff like me satisfied. The music was WAY overdramatic for my tastes, heightening the drama in anticipation of some huge climax.. only to be let down with some meaningless line. People were asleep in the theater all around us, including my wife, and I admit struggling to stay awake myself."
"180minutes is just for conversation. No action at all. Slow pace like snail. If there is -ve Star rating, then i'll give it -ve. Its feels like forever to finish this movie.There is no plot for this movie. From beginning till the end just talk talk talk talk. This is absolutely not what i expect.Let me list the great movies of all time; Titanic, Jack Reacher, Angel Has Fallen, Armageddon, Hidden Figures, Rocky 4, Dark Knight, Kenshin, Shaolin Soccer, The Mask, Hell The Judge, Final Destination 1I don't get it why the rating so high for Oppenheimer. Its impossible to repeat this movie. I came with the high expectation because of the hype & high rating. After 30minutes watching this movie, im hoping it end very soon. Damn boring. Really frustrated coz this film is far below expectation."
"I expected more bomb making and testing than politics, but director wanted to show personal portrait of Oppenheimer.This film shows Oppenheimer's journey from being unable to demonstrate simple tasks at the laboratory as a student to becoming the director of the Manhattan Project. He is credited as the ""father of the atomic bomb.""The Ttrinity test scene is a masterpiece, It holds so much anticipation and music intensifies as the film proceeds, initially when the bomb explodes it was all quiet then a sudden drop of thunderous sound which was horrific and exciting as well.You will see how Lewis Strauss (played by Robert Downey Jr) has a key role in rise and fall of Robert Oppenheimer.My problem with this movie is, it has too many characters with a their own storyline. 3 hours of show time the movie still feels incomplete."
"Filmmakers bear a profound responsibility when employing elements of sacred literature in their works. Such material holds immense cultural and spiritual importance for millions, and any portrayal demands reverence and understanding. In delving into ancient scriptures, directors should approach the subject matter with a deep understanding or engage in meaningful discussions with experts to avoid unintended misrepresentations. One should not used content from popular and sacred scriptures whimsically. Even it's a common understanding to get a profound knowledge about it and then take suitable action."
"This was a good (not great, but good) film spoilt by the pervasive music, which made the first 30 minutes sound like a long trailer. It also made the dialogue exceptionally difficult to hear. I would actually watch it again at home just so I can actually hear what's going on. Maybe it's the nature of the iMax experience, which is incredibly bass-y.The good points: some great performances, almost Shakespearean in their intensity (although I'm not sure that the sex scenes really had anything to add); some fantastic cinematography - again, worth seeing at an iMax screen.Overall though, it could have been 40 minutes shorter and still told the story."
"Cinematography in states is in crisis for decades and budget of $100M cannot fix it. Big, big lack of fresh ideas obviously want to be replaced by technology. The only idea is to full packets with money and to push academy to get another Oscar cause so much money was invested! Eventually the result is very poor. Screen play is terrible, overacting characters (Murphy as well), from the movie I could not figure out what was the biggest contribution and achievement of Dr Oppennheimer ? (what he was politician, spin doctor, PR, ....) The only reason i went to cinema to watch this movie I was bored with whole day rain. I regret every moment I spent in cinema. Eventually I would be better I stay in rain and breath fresh air."
"Well, as you know, nolan's mind can not think linear, there might be 5 to 6 timelines in the movies hither and tither. Nolan's research is exceptional. He clearly portrayed the intensity of Oppenheimer, the man behind the bomb. Yeah, the first 25 minutes were exceptional. The interrogation scene being long is another thing. I do not think interrogation happens that way. Florence pough, what the hell !!!, she does not even deserve 15 minutes !!!? There was not a long , heavy endings as his movies used to be. But, yeah he is Nolan. He did his way, Oppenheimer's is not in the project, literally, only his body is."
"Found it borning and confussing at times, but comes together in a full circle by the end. Found it to be to long and could have been shorter. Acting was amazing. Did not recognize some of the name actors until they showed some sort of mannerism. Based of a true story, I did find it interesting on historical events. We are always agaist other nations to be ahead and this was no different. I being 51, I took my dad and he was very pleased with everything and really enjoyed watching the movie. His comment was and that was history in a nut shell, and all the behind the sense I bet that still happens today."
"I suppose these reviews are tweaked, otherwise I can't explain these unrealistic reviews. After two hours later the majority of cinema audience started to view their phones. I'm too disappointed to see this kind of movie from a director like Nolan.The actors and their playing are great but the plot and longivity of nonsense outwighs everything.Set against the backdrop of World War II and the Manhattan Project, the film beautifully captures the tense atmosphere of the time, with meticulous attention to historical accuracy. The black-and-white cinematography enhances the gravity of the narrative, and the well-researched screenplay keeps the viewers engaged from start to finish.At the heart of the movie is the brilliant performance by the lead actor, who flawlessly embodies the persona of Oppenheimer. The portrayal goes beyond mere imitation and manages to capture the internal conflicts and moral dilemmas faced by the scientist as he struggles with his conscience over the development of the atomic bomb. The supporting cast also shines in their roles, effectively complementing the protagonist's journey and adding depth to the story."
"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a sweeping, epic, and visually stunning film that tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man who led the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb. The film is long (nearly three hours) and complex, but it is also incredibly engrossing and thought-provoking.Nolan's direction is masterful, and he uses his trademark visual style to create a film that is both visually arresting and emotionally powerful. The film is shot in IMAX, and the images are stunning. The film's score by Ludwig Göransson is also excellent, and it perfectly complements the film's visuals.The performances in Oppenheimer are all top-notch. Cillian Murphy gives a tour-de-force performance as Oppenheimer, and he is supported by an excellent cast that includes Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., and Kenneth Branagh.Oppenheimer is not an easy film to watch. It deals with some heavy subject matter, and it is not afraid to show the dark side of science and technology. However, it is also a film that is ultimately hopeful, and it suggests that even the most destructive forces can be used for good.Overall, Oppenheimer is a masterpiece. It is a film that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally powerful. It is a film that will stay with you long after you have seen it.Here are some of the things I liked about the film:The performances were all excellent, especially Cillian Murphy's performance as Oppenheimer.The visuals were stunning, especially the IMAX scenes.The score by Ludwig Göransson was excellent.The film dealt with some heavy subject matter in a thoughtful and intelligent way.Here are some of the things I didn't like about the film:The film was long (nearly three hours).The film could be slow-paced at times.The film's ending was a bit ambiguous.Overall, I highly recommend Oppenheimer. It is a film that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally powerful. It is a film that will stay with you long after you have seen it."
"Loved the movie, loved the actors efforts. After three hours I could again feel the fear from the Cold War. Impressive. Camera work in general is very professional.But am so distracted by the endless smoking cigarettes. Not necessary and the year of origin might not be an excuse. A Hollywood investigation into the smoking lobby should be in place. How many investment came from tobacco?And the worst moment: no wind in the open tower. On the ground the weather is awful. Winds all around the house and cars. But heb Oppenheimer climbs the stairs. And up there: Cables completely still.That's a huge production error."
"Start off by saying before watching the movie, I didn't even know the movie title was of the main character,, and I didn't even know who Christopher Nolan was or his work until after watching the movie and looking it up. Instead I had heard it's about a movie about war and supposedly a 'masterpiece'.After watching the movie, here's what I did/not enjoy...PROS
Some amazing acting from the cast, Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon and Emily Blunt were particular standouts for me.I did enjoy the dialogue content, but I hated its delivery (see below).CONS
Rapid fire edits throughout the entire movie made it very difficult to follow the storyline, I don't think more than 3 or 4 mins was spent on each scene - which was not enjoyable for a 3hr long movie.VERY dialogue heavy - combined with the fast edits above, it felt like they were trying to cram too much into 3 hrs. And it's okay to have fast conversations in each scene, but then it jump to the next fast-paced conversation scene, and the next and so forth. There was no time to digest the weight of what just happened!Poor visual storytelling - the fast edits + dialogue heavy script combined made it feel like the cinema format was not properly delivered, and it felt like I was being 'told' what was happening, not 'shown'. Based on this, I probably could've just listened to this movie like an audiobook, and had the same experience.No emotive storytelling either - when I finally figured out Oppenheimer was a person (and the main character) I thought this would become an emotional story about his life, relationships, aspirations and fears. Instead, it felt more like a rapid-fire roll call of his personal and work resume - almost like a documentary.Strange sound design in some parts - there were some parts when the actors were speaking (eg Emily Blunt) and I had no idea what she saying, so much so it made me wish the cinema had included subtitles!! Surely I could expect more for a $100M movie?I'm struggling to understand how on earth this movie is considered a 'masterpiece'? Not a movie I'd watch again..."
"Ok let me start by the obvious ratings which were thoroughly written and explained by the previous reviewers. I will be brief:
Oscar for best Direction : Christopher Nolan
Oscar for best performance by an actor in a leading role: Cilian Murphy
Oscar for best Screenplay : Christophe Nolan
Oscars for best supporting actor : Matt Damon and/or Rober Doweny Jr
Oscar for best editing : Jenifer Lame
Oscar for best music : Ludwig Goransson
Oscar for the most unnecessary casting to an unworthy Oscar holder: Rami Malek
Etc etc etc...
So why the 6 then: Because the film is unnecessary. Its about something that already happened, and we are all aware of (take for example the atomic bomb first testing scene in Los Alamos). It's a biography of a person that we cannot relate to because his character (as depicted in the film) is two-dimensional. The film's subject matter is boring. Its very well written but its unnecessarily too long. And finally because it didn't manage to provide) any sort of feelings (well ok apart from some arousal in the unnecessary sex scenes). I believe that Nolan's next film should be about Psychedelia and it's influence to humanity in a Philosophical, Sociological and Spiritual level (as Kubrick did in 2001: A Space Odyssey). I'm sure that with a film like that, he will be able to use show his full spectrum as a Director and as an artist."
"Extremely boring and long movie. Thinking that this might be another Nolan marvel, but then it could not stand up to expectations. The first half of movie could have been finished within 45 mins and the second half i was expecting some action from WW2. But there were just names Hiroshima and Nagasaki etc. But nothing significant shown. The court room drama was too long, movie had some other famous actors yet it failed to create its mark. The needless romance lasting intermittently was equally useless.Personally, this movie fails to create the hype for me. Seeing such great reviews went to see in theatres, but then its just worth OTT."
It would seem that a movie like this is build on a great research. In the first part of the movie Oppenheimer is in the Netherlands at the University of Leiden where he gives a lecture in Dutch. He learned it in 6 weeks. However the language that he really speaks is German. And I should know because I am Dutch. Somehowe in most American movies they think we speak German in the Netherlands. The movie itself is interresting but sometimes a bit chaotic with the timelines. If I ever will see this movie a second time? I think I will pass. 7 out of 10 rating is the most I van give. Which is To my standards a food score.
"Oppenheimer is a long, slow-burning film that is not for everyone. The film is over three hours long, and it can be quite dull at times. However, the soundtrack is excellent, and the film's middle section is particularly well-done.The film tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who led the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb. The film is well-acted, with Cillian Murphy giving a standout performance as Oppenheimer. However, the film's length and slow pace can be a major drawback.If you are a fan of Christopher Nolan's films, you may enjoy Oppenheimer. However, if you are looking for a more exciting or fast-paced film, you may be disappointed.Here is a more detailed review of the film:Pros:
Excellent acting, especially by Cillian Murphy
Beautiful cinematography
Excellent soundtrack
Thought-provoking themes
Cons:
Too long
Slow pace
Mind-numbingly dull at timesOverall, Oppenheimer is a well-made film with some excellent performances. However, the film's length and slow pace may be a major drawback for some viewers. I would recommend the film to fans of Christopher Nolan's films, but others may want to wait for it to be released on streaming."
"Totally underwhelmed with Oppenheimer.Enrico Fermi barely got mention, nor did Leo Szilard.Edward Teller came over goodie-goodie instead of the pigheaded man he was.No mention of important things like the plutonium core being stuck for a while till it cooled down. Or where the Uranium came from. Matt Damon was unimpressive and completely lacked cred as the hard driving, determined Groves, instead conveying like a pushover.Way too much soapie time with Gene Tatlock, although it clearly showed she was murdered and did not suicide.Robert Downey was pleasantly good, am surprised.Kenneth Branagh and David Krumholtz were utterly delightful.Other things : Groves (Damon) gets relatively little screen time, considering the Manhattan Project existed because of him.Also, there was very little display of the friendship between Oppenheimer and Groves.I read it would be very accurate and fact rich ... Not really, Christopher.Way, way too little attention to the science and important stuff like the graphite fission experiment under the tennis stand."
"An honest view from a good fan of Nolan's work ; The protagonist is definitely worth a movie, the story is very interesting, the cast is first class but I sincerely think that the movie is overdone ...Some aspects of the movie are just useless ; the sex scenes are fade, inhuman... I felt that I did not get out of the movie knowing Oppenheimer more.It's true that the explosion scene was a master class but again Nolan has all the means to unleash some quality scene like these. Action and technical scenes are nothing fancy for him !Gary Oldman ; LEGENDARY in very few shots.Clearly, the means were there, the story, the cast but the mixture was overdone ...I cannot help but say that there were better biopics ; a beautiful mind, the theory of everything, ... this one not that crazy.The SCORE was forgettable ... very much so !"
"Bla bla bla three hours of talking and talking and still more talking..............
A very long and very boring movie that did not touch on the Japanese or Soviet side......
Where is the bomb? How did they drop it? What happened before and after?This movie is more biography than a cinematic masterpiece sadly...........
Soundtrack was nice but still not enough to sit three hours watching men talking and talking.This movie could be a scene from a real movie about the blast in Hiroshima or the atomic bomb..........
Anyway some ppl enjoyed it, I didn't.........
All guys were going to watch Barbie, I understand why."
"This very heavily marketed, promoted and hyped film was hugely disappointing. The acting is outstanding and there is some good writing, but it is riddled with unnecessary and ineffective narrative gimmicks and visuals of explosions, space, sub-atomic particles etc. They might have worked if used with better judgment and discernment, but they don't. They're just annoying and tiresome. Same goes for the heavy-handed and over the top score. I felt that most of this was in service of the director's ego rather than the film itself.I quite like Christopher Nolan films - Memento was excellent - but this was tedious drivel.I watched the 1980 BBC series (on Amazon) after watching the film and, old-fashioned though it was, thought it was much better (although closer to 7 hours rather than 3). Some of the scenes in the earlier series reminded me of scenes in this film (eg the countdown and explosion of the Trinity test."
"Saw Oppenheimer in IMAX format. It's a decent enough biopic but itvsuffers from an unjustified grandiose directorial style. Nokan's insistence on film vs digital and penchant for unnecessary melodrama make it seem like more of a major work than it actually is. It's worth seeing, to be sure, but I think it's one of those overhyped productions that will be lost in the dusty film archive where pomposity goes to die.The sound level, which the theater insists was set according to strict instructions from the studio, was abusively loud. My hearing threshold was messed up for hours after the viewing. Bring ear protection if you see it in theater, just in case. Actually this film just barely justifies theater viewing - - it's probably more enjoyable to simply watch on your big screen at home."
