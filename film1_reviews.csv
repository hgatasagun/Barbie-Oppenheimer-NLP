"Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the ""strong"" woman."
"The first reason to go see it:It's good fun. It's fairytale comedy, over the top, pastiche and it works! It simply does! Margot Robie and Ryan Gosling have great chemistry. Everybody sorta agrees on that.Kids are probably not the target audience, although if they would watch it, they wouldnt be shocked or something, they would merely be missing the social and gender issues and jokes of many scenes.The second reason to go see it:It really looks the part. I am not into sets or costumes in particular (at all), but I was impressed with the fun world they had created. It really looks fabulous and I really appreciate it when a movie is eyecandy from start till finish.The third and best reason to go see it:I am a dude and I honestly feared the worst when going along with my wife. But I honestly did not expect this sugarcoated, fairytale Barbieworld to touch my heart in the end, but it did! What the what!They somehow created a finale, that gave me goosebumps and a terrific feel good vibe. You cant wish for more than that. As a dude watching a Barbie picture. Hello!The only reason AGAINST seeing it:If you are a dude and dont like men being portrayed as weak and emotionally inferior to women, then better not go see it, because all the men are (hilarious) loosers and whiners in this movie, with a brilliant performance by Ryan Gosling as an insecure crybaby, who just cant get Barbie to love him.Feared the worst, but in the end I was pleasantly suprised. It's certainly not a brilliant movie, but it is a perfect summer escape movie, with lots of jokes and a wonderful feel good vibe!"
"The first thing you need to know about Barbie is that Ryan Gosling is the best part of the entire film. For the duration he is over the top, dumb and hilarious. Every scene he was in had me laughing and I enjoyed just about everything he did in the film.Margot Robbie is a great choice for Barbie and as usual puts in a fantastic performance. She hit pretty much every mark in my opinion and I can't see anyone taking her place in this role.Where the film falls flat unfortunately is not the characters, actors or even humour for that matter. It's the incessant political lecturing.It's no surprise that this film takes a strong feminist angle. That's to expected. Barbie was a doll that portrayed many different professions in an attempt to show young girls that they could strive for me than what they were told they could do. But that was the 1950s. This is 2023.By no means is the world a perfect representation of equality today, but it is so vastly superior in that category than it ever has been that the theme of the film falls a little flat. Telling young girls to go after their dreams and not be beholden to any stereotypes is a positive, wonderful message and one that could've been portrayed so much better. But instead, the film teeters on the edge of a radical feminist position.I've seen a lot of people say the film hates men. I disagree with this. I don't think it hates men. Instead, it takes a very simplistic, black and white view of Western culture and assumes that women's lives are overall difficult and men's lives are overall quite easy. When in reality, life is tough. For everyone. At least 99% of us. Claiming otherwise is unjust.However, it's not just the political stance it takes that brings the film down. It's how incessant it is. They are without any shame pushing a political message through the screen down your throat every 10 minutes. It's unbearable at times. Going to the cinema or watching a film should be an enjoyable experience, not a lecture.This film could've been beloved by all genders and ages. Both men and women love Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. This feels like an easy lay up for the filmmakers but by going the political route they end up having many jokes go over kids heads and alienate many of the people who where genuinely excited to see this film.I give it a 6/10 because of Gosling and most of the humour. It was enjoyable overall. I think Hollywood needs to stop employing multi millionaire actors to lecture the general public on how to live. It's embarrassing."
"As much as it pains me to give a movie called ""Barbie"" a 10 out of 10, I have to do so. It is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted, I have to give the filmakers credit. Yes, I am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer. I'm a guy. I like guy things. Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives. And man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades - pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours! The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don't agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that's ok. This movie wasn't designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were ""allowed"" to have ""real jobs"" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I'll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10 masterpiece."
"Wow, this movie was a love letter to cinema. From the Kubrick reference at the opening, to the soundstage being 100% real - no cgi for the sets. There were dance sequences like in the olden days (think Grease) and the costuming , wow the costuming. Greta Gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way. The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.The acting was perfection, I loved seeing the variety of Barbie's on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences, this has to be a voluntary PG13 rating as there wasn't swearing or nudity. There was one beach fight amongst the Kens but that's not really violence compared to today's average films, no one was harmed nor any fake blood used.I actually didn't like the ending at all, and I was quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played the creator of Barbie but made two quips about the IRS getting her for tax evasion - something Ruth Handler never dealt with. Her problem was with the SEC after she had signed off on a positive Mattel earnings forecast when they knew they were in a down quarter - how's that so tough to explain?Irregardless, I want to see this movie again. And again. And again."
"Barbie begins in an irresistible way, as a fun dismantling of all the plasticized and body image ideals the doll has set for little girls throughout the decades, as Barbie faces an existential crisis and must journey into the real world to find her true self. Then about halfway through America Ferrera shows up as a dissatisfied Barbie designer and starts hammering us about the patriarchy, as if all men were clueless, macho oafs like Ken that needed to be smugly tolerated by the greater hierarchy of women. Gerwig seems to be projecting her issues about Hollywood and it makes Barbie out of touch."
"I thought this would be so much different. The ending made me feel sad and empty. Ken and Barbie don't end up together and they made Ken seem like a complete idiot. Actually they presented men as being dumb throughout the whole movie. And I'm not a man but that's just not true. It was depressing and sad and never the way Barbie was created for. I know a lot of people won't agree with me and that's okay but it was just pointless going to see it. The only good thing is that the Barbie aesthetic was beautifully done.I just do not like the way they presented men, it's almost like they want women to turn against men. Which in that case the point of the movie is very degrading for many people."
"I don't know if I put spoilers in here. I am super worn out. Haha So I will just put that I did.I had no clue what this movie was like or about. It just seemed like a strange, different type of movie. To me, it was going to be some kind of movie for kids that tells you everything is perfect. It was nothing like that.There were a couple of young teen girls on the right of my mom and me. I felt weird knowing that. There is no way I would bring a kid or teen to see this.The movie is really all focused on political and gender views. So that one totally surprised me.There are points in which I kind of rolled my eyes. A bit of the singing kind of went on. There were also times that I was all teary.There are sexual references in this. Young kids would not understand. But one part in which she tells of a specific thing that she does not have, and a specific thing Ken does not have, that was a bit strange.The end threw me off. Here is a movie that seems to be saying we are equal, but we are not treated that way. Yet, at the same time it seems to be making men out to be mindless idiots. Also, something one of the male characters asks at the end and the reply the woman gives, seems to lead one to believe that things will be the exact same as they were. But unlike the way things seem to be, in Barbie land, the women will be above all men. I didn't really get that. Then, what may be the last lines of the movie, place Barbie somewhere. I didn't get the point of it.I heard adults laughing repeatedly. The kids that were their kind of sat silent.This is one of those movies that I cannot see every watching again. But it was fun and unique seeing it in the theater. Also, I dug the set design all the other stuff in the Barbie world. It was just cool to see."
"It pains me to say it, but I enjoyed this movie so much more then I was expecting to, musical numbers, humour, there truly is something for the whole family yo enjoy.Bright, garish and somewhat kitsch, those were my expectations, and sure it's a veritable cornucopia of glitter and rainbows, but what I wasn't expecting, was for the film to be so engaging, there's actually some real depth that I wasn't expecting. That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this. Greta Gerwig did a great job.Margot Robbie is glorious as Barbie, Ryan Gosling was great I thought. The pair shared some terrific scenes, real chemistry, and plenty of cutting one liners.Great use of music, everything fitted into the film so well.8/10."
"As a woman that grew up with Barbie, I was very excited for this movie. I was curious to see how they would evolve the ""stereotypical Barbie"" into something more. But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain't the way to get it.Barbieland flips the script on the patriarchy of the real world, giving women the power and leaving the Kens as attractive accessories. Once Ken gets a glimpse of the real world he brings the patriarchy to Barbieland and the Barbies are ""brainwashed"" (this happens suddenly and without much explanation). The Kens are bumbling fools with zero understanding of governance, and Barbieland falls into disarray.The movie's solution to this is for the Barbies to give a lot of Ted talks on the patriarchy, fool the Kens into war with each other, and rule once again. But isn't the point if gender equality... equality?The feminist messaging could have been so much more effective if it was laid on so THICK. More humor and nuance please. The story gets lost, the real world characters don't add much, and not much changes in the end.What was enjoyable was the acting, the sets and of course the nostalgia."
"8.5/10
While i'm not so sure at first, the movie kept getting even more fun, entertaining, and definitely better, also surprisingly deal with a legit serious stuff, Barbie is a weirdly fun movie that fills with this very interesting concept, definitely the first time that's ever done, Greta Gerwig has created this whole new style of filmmaking specifically for Barbie, from the intentionally weird yet creative editing, some awkward and cringe scene, i found the comedy so funny instead of cringe, Barbie is one of the most original movie of the year and also one of the most original movie i've seen in a while, we all know Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is gonna carry the movie and they are, but Will Ferrell, Simu Liu, and the whole rest of the cast were also great and entertaining, the soundtrack was just great, except Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice ""Barbie World"" song that are just absolutely terrible, but Billie Eilish ""What Was I Made For?"" tune that kept haunting in the background until it finally get the perfect scene to played it was really the best thing because that song was just beautiful and emotional, anyway, Barbie is a lot of fun, while there is still some noticeable flawed, most of them i found it funny, entertaining, colourful, creative, and fun, pure fun, it's something that i probably will love it even more the second time i see it, but as of right now, Barbie was a good time, definitely recommended and with this movie somehow it's actually possible to have a live-action Barbie movie, all you need to have is a good writer, good director, and good cast, and they delivers mostly."
"Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have a knack for incorporating the many little observations of life, whether funny or deeply interpersonal, into a screenplay. Gerwig manages to direct them with great visuals and clever transitions.Unfortunately, the only major weakness of the film, in my opinion, also lies in the screenplay. When dealing with larger societal issues, it lacks depth and possibly understanding. The observations work, but the contextualization falls short. The approach feels crude and superficial. This creates a confusing overall impression, as the finely crafted small observations remain convincing. A film that is so intelligent, funny, and creative on an individual level suddenly seems foolish in the grand scheme of things.Key moments in the film, such as the encounter with the inventor, fail to evoke emotions and come across as insincere. The angry rant about the struggles of being a woman feels cheap. There seems to be a lack of sensitivity, as if someone wanted to vent without making any effort to package it intelligently.Any scenes that trigger a sense of injustice and express societal criticism in small moments no longer feel precise and may even intentionally appear exaggerated, rather than being convincing parts of a larger whole.Overall, I'm not entirely sure what to make of the film. On one hand, I had a great time, but on the other hand, I left the screening with mixed feelings.Making it even more confusing are the consistently brilliant acting performances across the board, with Ryan Gosling obviously standing out."
"I went to see this today, everyone in my group dressed in pink and ready to at least be entertained by pastel-colored camp for two hours. BARBIE kind of succeeds there: I loved the costuming and sets of Barbieland, and Margot Robie is such a fantastic actress, the perfect embodiment of the optimistic, she-can-do-it-all Barbie. Ryan Gosling was a scene-stealer with his horse obsession and faux mink coat.Despite all this, the movie as a whole was disappointing. As much as it succeeds at campy comedy and musical numbers, its attempts at feminist commentary and existentialism fall flat. The messaging is so on the nose, spelled right out for the audience so no one will have to strain their brain. Not that these scenes can't be funny or hit home (the guitar gag gave me college flashbacks), but a little subtlety could not have hurt.I also had issues with the differences between Barbieland and the real world. I can accept everyone in Barbieland talking in what many term ""Marvel speak."" If you've watched anything made in the past 15 years you'll recognize it right away: ""You know, we make all these pop culture references (like Spiderman in the MCU with ALIENS) and we say what we think in the bluntest way possible because it's so awkward that it's funny... oooor it WAS when it was novel and new years ago. Now it's staler than a can of Pepsi Clear. Oh yeah-- I remember the 90s! Macarena!""The Barbies and Kens are supposed to be simplistic figures with no sense of emotional nuance. However, the humans in the real world are supposed to be the opposite-- messy, complicated, not that charming. Why are they also talking like that? It just feels lazy.And then there are the existential themes: Margot Robie's Barbie gets tired of being an ideal of independent womanhood in an eternal paradise. At the end, she chooses to be human and embrace mortality because mortality is ultimately what gives our lives meaning. A decent theme. Too bad the movie never really delves into it. It's given lip service, nothing more.It had some cute moments but honestly, the end experience was meh. The hype was more memorable than the finished product."
"I was honestly doubting this movie at first, but surprisingly I find myself really liking it quite a lot.Set in the colorful Barbie Land, stereotypical Barbie lives a perfect life every single day. One day, she shows signs of being...a human. She decides to go to the Real World to find the cure in order to make herself perfect again.Barbie is a fun movie that has surprisingly plenty of heartwarming moments and good messages to offer. The set designs are eye-catching and on point as well. Both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling nailed their parts, but it is Gosling who mostly shines.Something I'm pretty sure of is this movie getting nominated for the Oscars, most likely for Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and probably Best Song for Billie Eilish. That song is beautiful and it's stuck in my head right now."
"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect. Overall, Barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy (sorry LEGO Movies) and an overall fantastic time at the movies."
"The film's universe and settings are fantastic. The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie. Instead, we're left with a film that almost divides and pits men against women, in an attempt to make it a feminist and political film.Instead of seeing a light, fun film, I saw a rather heavy-handed movie whose storyline is centered around patriarchy.It's a real shame, because the film's potential is pretty amazing. I came away disappointed, but not totally disgusted either."
"In this day and age with society overall becoming more and more polarized and our leaders around the world doing nothing to improve dialogue, it seems that people became broken records. Now everything in the movies and TV shows is perceived as preachy, not everything is a conspiracy, people need to consider that movies and TV shows at its core, and specially the good ones, are about sharing perspectives and allow the audience, if their minds are opened to it, to acknowledge all sides of the stories.So let's start with the actual review, Greta Gerwig seems to have found an actual legitimate story for the type of message she delivered, contrary to most criticism I didn't find the movie preachy or biased at all, I actually felt it was incredibly balanced and the message made sense considering the plot. Sometimes I do agree that these (for some reason) delicate social topics tend to be pushed into films because a lot of studio directors want to align with trends to make a few more dollars, but in this particular film I didn't felt that at all!It's a fictional story that has the ability to tell a bit of historical context of one of the most (if not the most) famous dolls in the world and how it impacted the world culture and how it actually affected women's image with its controversial decisions.The other aspect of this fictional story is providing perspective, of how women are perceived and treated in our society, the rooted systemic issues we tend to ignore AND with the Barbie plot device provide some fun and interesting analogy of how society would be if it was the other way around and women were the ones holding most power.But again there's no hidden dark meaning, it's just a woman's perspective and if you think about it, even though reality change a lot considering the country where you live, it's not that ridiculous, the story is ultimately about equality and its a fun innocent approach to it.Margot Robbie is insanely talented and its amazing to watch her portray this role, for once I am hoping that we keep the dialogue opened and stop inventing false theories ."
"I've been excited for this movie for over a year. The casting was perfect and the acting was amazing! The set was next level, the tiny details were all there and even the highest barbie fan couldn't ask for anything more from it. It is PERFECTION.The first half of the movie was really good, a decent plot, plenty of laughs and a decent explanation of what is going on. Unfortunately, after a while it just becomes a rant about feminism & how oppressed women are. I'm a woman myself, and I'm all for equal rights, but the amount they shoved into this movie just overtook the fun completely, it felt very forced and by the end, you were left with the same feeling you get after scrolling through a toxic comment thread on a social media post. So sad.( SPOILERS AHEAD )Even more sad, the end message of the film when the barbies take back barbieland is basically that they are no better than the kens (or 'men') are. They manipulate them, undermine them, and then when given the chance to be better (the kens asking to have one ken presented in the Supreme Court which is all barbies), they laugh and tell them no, choosing to treat the kens or 'men' how they've 'always' treated women. So they are no better than the kens in the end. How sad! Isn't there a world where they can be better? Include the kens and all be equals?? What are we trying to teach young girls? That feminism is demeaning men just like we have been demeaned in the past? Also, I would have hoped we were past making a movie entirely about how 'hard' women have it. Life is hard for most people, men & women alike, and it's easier when we acknowledge that and treat each other like fellow humans instead of two warring species.."
"I have been waiting for this to release for so long and I finally got to watch it today. I absolutely loved it! It was fun, it had Margot Robbie (and extra stuff for Tarantino's out there if you know what I mean) And it had some absolute bangers! What more could you want from a new summer classic?Honestly the depth of the story ain't there but what do you expect from a film about a Barbie? Lol I'll probably go back and watch it again tbh and I'll probably purchase it once it releases on blu ray as I did rather enjoy it (seriously my mouth hurts from smiling and laughing) there are some touching moments where Robbie really shines I just wish there were a little more because as everyone I absolutely adore Margot and her films.Anyway Barbie is a blast. It's a definite recommend on my list."
"My Review - Barbie
In Cinemas now
My Rating 6.5/10I've been keenly looking forward to seeing this much publicised movie because I'm a great fan of Margo Robbie, Ryan Gosling and Greta Gerwig's work.I held the opinion from first hearing about it that it was either going to be brilliant and I'd love it or a huge disappointment and I'd loathe it in other words no in between for me.How ever that's not the case I didn't love it and I didn't loathe it I have to accept that I
just didn't get it ?Perhaps it's because that I'm a 70 plus baby boomer male who felt that the strong feminist message directed towards the predominantly heterosexual male patriarchy for me was just preaching to the converted .Barbie is a comedy fantasy which certainly packs a not so subtle feminist smack in the face of the men who devalue the equality and contribution that women play in our society but they won't see Barbie.The audience on this special preview was young mainly women and they seemed to get the jokes that I didn't and seemed to react very well to the movie applauding at the conclusion.No spoilers about the plot you should judge it yourself as the story is not as simple as the trailer portrays it to be. Barbie and Ken leave the other Barbies and Ken's behind in Barbieland to venture through a portal caused by a stereotypical Barbie played to perfection by Margo Robbie . Barbie is experiencing disturbing emotions that she has to explore further in the real world of humans to understand in an effort to retain her eternal optimism.Ken her buff nerdy and needy boyfriend played by Ryan Gosling joins Barbie on her quest to travel through the portal landing at Venice Beach California complete with roller skates only to discover that the values and gender roles of Barbie land are reversed in the real world . The question for both the surprised dolls is which world do they want to live in?Pink cloud sunny Barbie land where every day is the same and perfect or the human world of Corporate greed and misogyny where you grow old and die?Margo Robbie and Ryan Gosling both are impressive and their comedy timing adds a light touch to the darker undertone of the film.Barbie for me has some entertaining moments but they were melting moments for me and while I hope it's popular for the creators of the movie I'm left puzzled at what audience it's aimed at ?The male population that Greta Gerwig cleverly parodies through Ken and his Ken buddies certainly wouldn't see her movie and I think the Disney generation of under 15 would be bored .I did enjoy the technical aspects of Barbie and the incredible amount of research and effort that has gone into producing this very expensive would be box office blockbuster.I also enjoyed homage to great movies of the past like Stanley Kubric's 2001 A Space Odysee , Saturday Night Fever, and of course The Wizard of Oz .It's one of the most anticipated movies of 2023 and has been in the pipeline for over a decade and in 2018 after little action was passed into the hands of Warner Bros then in 2019 they finally announced Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig as the lead actor-director duo for this film.Director Greta Gerwig co wrote the screenplay with her partner with Noah Baumbach basing their story on the famous Barbie fashion dolls by Mattel . It is the first live action Barbie film so a lot of creative reputations are dependent on its success .Mattel, the toy company that created Barbie obviously approved of the movie getting screen credit and representation in Greta Gerwig's clever perhaps to clever script.Mattel contributed input towards the set design of the film keeping the old-school charm of the Barbie world intact and I suspect there will be a surge in sales as all the famous Barbie dolls get a mention in this film.Noah Baumbach is Executive Producer as well as his partner Greta Gerwig and Margo Robbie the movies effervescent star are all producers on this project that has an estimated production budget of $145 million US$.Margo Robbie has been quoted as saying ""that the film's aim is to subvert expectations and give audiences ""the thing you didn't know you wanted.I'm not so sure about that statement as Barbie didn't reach my expectations and I felt the thing I didn't know I wanted wasn't what I wanted at all.Top marks to Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto who created a unique color palette for the film that Greta Gerwig named ""Techni-Barbie,"" after the Technicolor format. Also top marks to two time Academy Award Winner designer Jacqueline Durran. It's a given that costumes would be one of the most important factors about the movie,"
"This movie is so much fun. It starts off really strong although the story does move away from ""Barbieland"" sooner than I would have liked. Nonetheless, it regains its footing with the final act in particular and I could not stop laughing at Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken. That song will forever be stuck in my head.There are also plenty of good messages to be taken away from this experience, that is if you're not an insecure middle-aged male terrified of women. I loved everything the movie had to say about the patriarchy and barbies and growing up and consumerism and so much more.I am excited to watch it again soon. The pacing is not perfect and its huge potential is not fully matched, but purely as a cinematic experience I will never forget this movie."
"The movie was very funny and really enjoyable to laugh at with the full theatre. However, the messages of the movie were the problem. I was never really sure what I was supposed to take away, there was nothing about finding equality or love it was all about how every man cat falls every woman or women can't be anything. It was really silly because there was no accurate reflection of America at any single point except for Barbie getting called a Fascist for no reason by a 14 year old. I enjoyed how they called out women for hating women and how they really tried to preach empowerment and the ability to be anything, but at the same time there was so much resentment and they ended the movie by reinstating hate. The majority of the movie was hating men as much as possible. That's just whatever because what really matters is the story. Well it fell short on that mark and it was really disappointing. The pacing was horrible, the villain won and was pretty irrelevant in the long run, the story was all over the place, and it is totally not for kids. I think the worst part is how disappointed I was at the opportunity to really make something special and it just wasn't. 6 points for all the laughs and fun I had and I would expect 6-7 to be an appropriate rating."
"My 15-year old daughter wrote the following review and posted it to my IMDB account.As a Barbie fan I was very excited for this movie. I was expecting a light-hearted goofy comedy. Instead I got a movie that felt as though it didn't know where it was going or what it was doing.The movie starts of as a fun goofy comedy, then things start changing.Things start going wrong for Barbie and she has to go to the real world to fix it. She is supposed to help the person who has been playing with her to fix her problems in Barbie Land. This on its own would've been enough for a movie, but it keeps going.Instead of going in depth about the life of the mother who has caused these problems for Barbie, the movie goes off in a totally different direction.Ken sees the real world's patriarchy and goes back to Barbie Land to replicate it. Barbie has to go back to Barbie Land to save it from its new patriarchy.By the end of the movie Barbie decides to live in the real world. The Kens of the Barbie Land are basically back to as little power they had before their uprising. I find the treatment of the Kens at the end to be hypocritical compared with the movie's supposed messaging about equalityThis movies writing and plot were bad. Even as a feminist I acknowledge that the messaging was terribly preachy. I feel as though many of these different plot ideas could've been good on their own. They are just too confusing all together.On a good note the acting and sets in this movie were really good. I loved seeing the plastic Barbie houses life-sized. The movie was also very funny at parts. I just wish the movie picked a clearer direction."
"I got free tickets for a preview and to be honest I was more than a little embarrassed to go. I did not tell a soul. As a cool middle aged gentleman if word got out this could have really affected my street cred.Anyway, I embraced the journey and I'm glad that I did. Here is my review written as a pretentious critic that I aspire to be in my next life:In Greta Gerwig's latest directorial venture, ""Barbie,"" the esteemed filmmaker takes on the monumental task of unravelling the enigma that is Barbie, the iconic doll that has fascinated and polarized society for decades.With Margot Robbie as the eponymous character and Ryan Gosling as Ken, Gerwig's live-action rendition delves into the complex world of Barbie, attempting to extract deeper meaning from this cultural phenomenon.Gerwig masterfully navigates the treacherous waters of branded material, infusing the narrative with a blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. The result is a thought-provoking exploration of Barbie's role as a feminist symbol, challenging societal perceptions of femininity and girlhood.Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals?Gerwig compels the audience to contemplate this question, weaving it throughout the fabric of the film.In reality Margot Robbie dominated the film as expected and has developed into a true cinematic icon. The flm was fun and far above my expectations hence I'm giving it an 8 and boasting I watched Barbie."
"This is very much a movie that will get devided opinions on it, my cousin said well this is two hours of my life i will never get back, and me? I left the theatre in such a good mood. It was the sense of humor for me, laughed so hard. Specially Ryan Gossling was sooooo good and funny, many familiar faces to spot also. And margot robbie come on... the perfect casting for Barbie. I also have to say, the way they created Barbie land was so amazing, it just makes you just want to there. I don't really have anything bad to say about this movie. I can understand not everyone will love it. But i am sure it is a iconic film already."
"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss. The middle expositional phase of the movie, I must say, is a bore.The movie was so close to being great, but it was incapable of delivering a message without having a character literally give a speech worth of dialogue.What could have been a great satire and what began as a cleverly funny movie turned into a preachy and moralizing movie in the end. But I guess the charm of the first half of the movie made up for the shortcomings."
"I mean, Margo Robbie as Barbie just made perfect sense, but I really wanted to see the movie when I herd that Ryian Gosling was going to be Ken, I just thought that would be hilarious and I was right!I was a little bit nervous when I heard this was not going to be an in-universe thing and that Barbie would enter the real world, but that was a great story.The real-life story did give the art direction the purpose of making a ""BarbieLand"" with life size dream houses even I wanted to live in. The film just looks really good.Give praise to director Greta Gerwig because this movie is fun but there were a lot of deep life cuts and the balance between the two was perfect.It was good hands down."
"Some friends freaking out that I went to see Barbie lol I mean I mentioned I went coz my sister insisted since ages. Anyway the movie was bad. These days, every other director and producer wants to convey messages about women rights and feminism through whatever platform possible and this movie was a perfect example of that with sheer cringe to convey all that. I wished I had gotten the ticket for Oppenheimer in the same timings as my sister's Barbie show. Other than that, the acting done by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling was great so can't take that away from them. They did justice to their roles."
"I really enjoyed the first 20 minutes of the movie. It was very upbeat, positive and light. However, things soon became negative about 20 - 25 minutes into the movie. I couldn't stand it. Barbie's world and attitude was a constant bummer. Ken's attitude was sour. For the next hour (and more) the movie just lived in negativity.I bought tickets to this show a month ago. And, I saw it the day before the official opening day. I was very excited about this movie. And, I was playing the music (Dua Lipa) song almost every day. I was really excited for this movie - and was looking forward to something very positive. But, the vast majority of the movie was the ""conflict"" part of the writing. It was just too much! The movie didn't need to go that way, that far, that fast. I would have preferred a more shallow and fun Barbie movie vs. This Barbie movie filled with over an hour of conflict."
"Barbie is everything expected of it and so much more, a self aware and meta comedy made for fans and newcomers alike that's also incredibly profound, layered and really funny. It's the best version of itself and just immensely satisfying that the Barbie movie that got made on this scale is so weird and unique.Margot Robbie is perfect casting as Barbie, she nails the movement and switches between the eccentric Barbie Land and more emotionally tolling real world effortlessly. She has a terrific arc that's full of emotionally resonant moments and the almost parental nature with Gosling works beautifully.Ryan Gosling is phenomenal as Ken. Note perfect casting that gives him another welcome chance to move away from his usual introverted roles and tap into his impeccable comedic timing present in The Nice Guys, only here it's dialed up to eleven. It all culminates in a musical number that is painfully funny.Will Ferrell is essentially playing Lord Business again and him and his whole team of execs are just as cartoonish as the people in Barbie Land but it actually really works as a nice bit of satire that emphasises just how out of touch all of them are.America Ferrara gets one of the biggest speeches of the film and really makes it work and her relationship with Ariana Greenblatt adds a lot of heart to the film whilst allowing it to have its both ways when it comes to acknowledging the history of Barbie.Greta Gerwig's direction is excellent, getting the bigger budget she absolutely deserves and uses every penny. Magnificent dance numbers, a fun car chase and a Barbie Land that is as vibrant as possible and despite fully embracing its own artificial nature it feels more real and visually stunning than so much of what's out there.The soundtrack is another standout element, a great selection of songs from some of the best artists currently working all at the top of their game. Like the film, some are just really fun, some are very profound and every single one fits in effortlessly."
"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch."
"Barbie Movie ReviewWritten by Gerwig and her partner, Noah Baumbach, the movie introduces Barbie on yet another perfect day in Barbie Land, in which dolls played by humans exist in what resembles a toyland gated community. There, framed by a painted mountain range, Barbie and a diverse group of other Barbies rule, living in homes with few exterior walls. With their flat roofs, clean lines and pink décor - a spherical TV, tulip table and chairs - the overarching look evokes the era when Barbie first hit the market. It's an aesthetic that could be called bubble-gum mid century modern.This is a movie that acknowledges Barbie's unrealistic physical proportions-and the kinds of very real body issues they can cause in young girls-while also celebrating her role as a feminist icon.As the film's star, Margot Robbie finds just the right balance between satire and sincerity. She's the perfect casting choice; it's impossible to imagine anyone else in the role. The blonde-haired, blue-eyed stunner completely looks the part, of course, but she also radiates the kind of unflagging, exaggerated optimism required for this heightened, candy-coated world. Her performance is a joy to behold.And then there's Ken. Ryan Gosling is a consistent scene-stealer as he revels in Ken's himbo frailty. He goes from Barbie's needy beau to a swaggering, macho doofus as he throws himself headlong into how he thinks a real man should behave. Gosling sells his square-jawed character's earnestness and gets to tap into his ""All New Mickey Mouse Club"" musical theater roots simultaneously. He's a total hoot.Barbie can be hysterically funny, with giant laugh-out-loud moments generously scattered throughout. They come from the insularity of an idyllic, pink-hued realm and the physical comedy of fish-out-of-water moments and choice pop culture references as the outside world increasingly encroaches. But because the marketing campaign has been so clever and so ubiquitous, you may discover that you've already seen a fair amount of the movie's inspired moments, such as the ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" homage and Ken's self-pitying '80s power ballad.This movie is perhaps a giant two-hour commercial for a product, although no more so than The Lego Movie, yet Barbie doesn't go for the comedy jugular anywhere near as gleefully as that. It's entertaining and amiable, but with a softcore pulling of punches: slightly ionized, celebratory nostalgia for a toy that still exists right now. Still, if such a crowd-pleasing extravaganza can also offer some fodder for thoughtful conversations afterward, it's accomplished several goals simultaneously."
"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?"
"Let me start by saying that I'm by no means a conservative or traditional woman. I believe that inequality for women still is rampant even in first world countries and that we go through many problems. But damn...this movie is so corporate and shallow. It's clearly ordered and tailored by executives at Mattel to rebrand and sell more dolls. The movie starts well and has the potential of becoming something very good, but then it just goes downhill: the premise of the owner's feeling being projected onto the doll was going to lead to a very nice build up about a person's life journey and then Barbie and Ken go to the human world and cue in the speeches and preaching. This movie suffers from a bad case of showing and not telling, they keep repeating the same dialogues: patriarchy bad patriarchy bad patriarchy bad sexism sexism sexism, not even one time but MULTIPLE TIMES. These characters go into random rants like its a ted talk! The chemistry between the mother and daughter is absolutely nonexistent and their relationship is so cringe, You cant root for them or feel their feelings at all. Barbie should have understood how Kens had been feeling in the Barbieland the whole time which is a mimic of how many women are still treated in the society: just existing for the gaze of a woman (man). Yet what do they do? They manipulate them (with a super nonsense plan) and force them back to their original position while she gives him a half assed apology that could have been done better and end up to a more accurate point about equality. (I guess this is again meta and a reflection of how women are pitted against each other while people in charge benefit from that but its so badly done that it feels meh.)
I can imagine that in the boardroom they went through a discussion like this: People are going to think this is a feel good movie so we need to give them something deeper but also lets make it absurd and fast paced so that we can finish the plot quickly and also jump on the ""not taking itself serious"" bandwagon and also market these dolls again in the age of smartphone kids. The only reason this movie gets at 5 from me is the humor, which sometimes becomes very meta and creative and Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling have acted very well. Besides this, they could have just given us a simple feel good movie and I would have respected the creators more. Pass."
": I feel confused about this movie, probably like a lot of people, on one hand I laughed as I hadnt with a movie in a long time and the vibe this movie has is just very appealing, but on the other hand while not being an anti-men movie and actually trying to have a deep message, it feels at some parts like a tantrum. The way it handles its feminist message is not the best, because while it tries to give a meaningful speach, it almost boarders with hate speach and ridiculization, I say almost, because a lot of this situations are just played by the laughs and when theyre not, while being bad, theyre not terrible. But this makes it sound like a bad movie, which barbie is not, at the end it manages to actually give a meaningfull speech about the wrong in the real world and takes some minutes to understand both sides. It is still not the best ending possible because it can be a little too ridiculous, when you have a movie thats like that all the time I dont think it matters all that much. And at the end of the day I took home with me the minutes of laughter this movie gave to me, an enjoying fun time that is worth watching."
"So I went into the movie with little to no expectations and I was pleasantly impressed with the movie overall.So basically the movie is about Barbie who is starting to feel emotions and not everything feels perfect in Barbieland. She ventures to the real world to discover the solution of getting everything perfect again. Barbie is joined by the one and not only KEN, Ken is obsessed with Barbie and sees her as the centre of his world, he goes to the real world and discovers patriarchy, which leads to many events.The movie overall is actually quite funny, Ryan Gosling is fantastic as Ken and the stand out for me, he needs to be many versions of Ken and he kills then all !! Margott is also great, she brings a range to Barbie, for me also Weird Barbie was great, she was funny and brought a difference.There were times I felt the ""woman power"" thing was just a bit much and took me out of the movie, I feel like the movie had that message and didn't need to shove it down your throat but it decided to at points so for me that does bring it down a notch, the daughter was also just annoying hahaha yes I get it she hated the world bla bla, she just had no redeeming qualities, otherwise no complains and I do think it's worth seeing, solid 8/10."
"Im not really disappointed or love the movie to be honest. It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. I think people who played with Barbie dolls or just know the universe will be happy; they have a lot of references to the world and a lot of Barbie references to the dolls and the differents clothes and the impact of her in society. Some moments were also absurd ( the fight with all the Kens). Its good anyway."
"Barbie is based on Mattel's iconic plastic dolls of the same name. Barbie(Margot Robbie) lives a very happy life in Barbie Land, along with her fellow Barbies, Ken(Ryan Gosling) & his fellow Kens. Suddenly, Barbie goes through an existential crisis that makes her question Barbie Land & the truth of her existence.Barbie is a phenomenal film. Director Greta Gerwig has given us a movie that is a tribute to everyone who used to play with Barbie dolls during their childhood, while also making fun of all the tropes of Barbie dolls & Ken dolls. This film is hilarious, with a few emotional scenes that will make you tear up & a beautiful message at the end. The production design by Sarah Greenwood is awe-inspiring. All the songs are foot-tappingly flawless. The choreography is faultless. Margot Robbie is outstanding as Barbie. Robbie's multi-layered portrayal of the titular character, proves that she's the perfect choice to play Barbie. Ryan Gosling is spectacular as Ken. Gosling portrays a wide range of emotions, effortlessly. Ryan Gosling's Ken is the highlight of the movie. America Ferrera is fantastic as Gloria. Ariana Greenblatt is awesome as Sasha. Will Ferrell is hysterical as the Mattel CEO. Michael Cera is perfect as Allan. Helen Mirren is epic as the Narrator. The supporting cast is superb. Barbie is a must watch for a burst of childhood nostalgia & fans of Greta Gerwig, Margot Robbie & Ryan Gosling. Wear a bright pink shirt, grab your friends, head to your nearest theatre, watch it on the big screen & have an absolute whale of a time!"
"The concept of a Barbie movie is really unique and got me all exited. But unfortunately to me it delivers the same messages that we keep hearing as of lately.It started off quite funny, but after 45 minutes or so, the movie went in a direction I did not like. It took itself a bit too serious. I would have preferred a more lighthearted movie.Ryan Gosling did the best job out of everyone playing Ken I thought. The perfect guy with the perfect body and yet very campy, girly and insecure. Job well done, especially toward the end.If you are a fan of Barbie, you will probably get your money's worth."
"What a film! I was ecstatic about seeing Barbie and it definitely exceeded my expectations by far. As much as I was excited, I was a bit scared that the stakes were too high; after all Barbie is an icon and a part of so many people's childhood. For a film like this it's very easy to create something corny, disappointing, or unappealing to viewers. I'm so glad that Gretta Gerwig stepped up to the plate and created an absolute masterpiece.The film starts with showing the origin of Barbie in 1959. It explains how little girls used to play with baby dolls and commonly acted as their mothers, but wanted a doll that they could really play with instead of taking care of. And that's how Barbie came about. Then we see the beautiful Barbie world where every Barbie is a part of something. We see Barbie doctors, Barbie novelists, Barbie astronauts, Barbie everything! And in Barbie's world every day is perfect. The star of the show Margot Robbie plays ""Stereotypical Barbie"" and she starts to notice strange things happening to her. She has to visit the real world to see who was playing with her to discover why these strange things are happening. The rest of the film is about Barbie trying to find herself and discovering scary aspects of the real world that she was blinded by before.There was so much love put into this film and you can really see that on screen. The comedy in this film is so on point that the whole theater was laughing when I went to see this film. Huge kudos to Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, writers of this incredible screenplay. The script is pure genius; I love how the film really honors Barbie and what she was made for. The cast of this film is exceptional. Margot Robbie was originally producing the film until she was cast as Barbie. Margot is the perfect Barbie; she plays this role so well she is like a real-life Barbie on screen. The way she embodies Barbie is just so perfect. I was really excited to see Ryan Gosling as Ken since he's one of my favorite actors. There's a lot of controversy as to why Ryan Gosling was cast as Ken but he makes perfect sense. He plays Ken so well he really nails what it means to be Ken in this film. America Ferrera plays a Mom named Gloria and she is such an interesting character. She plays a mom who's going through struggles of just being a woman and I'm sure her character will speak to so many mothers. It would be a crime to not talk about the insane set. Funny enough, Greta Gerwig used so much pink paint for this set that it actually drained an entire company's supply. The Barbie world is exactly as you'd expect it -- from Barbie dream-houses to Barbie beaches -- everything looks like it came right out of a toy store. Rodrigo Prieto shot this film and the cinematography is extraordinary. As someone who grew up with Barbie, this film really speaks to me. I am in love with the score of this film. Billie Eilish's ""What was I made for"" is one of the most beautiful songs I've heard. This film is packed with so many great artists like Tame Impalla, Lizzo, Dua Lipa and many others.The film is packed with so many messages. I was surprised with how many topics this film covers -- what it means to be a woman, what it means to be a mother, what it's like to grow up in today's society, what is love, and so much more. This film is a celebration of women and girlhood but I also love how it represents men. Ken is discovering how men are viewed in today's society in a similar way to how Barbie is discovering who she is.I give Barbie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. By Zoe C. KIDS FIRST!"
"Its like watching at ""Truman's show"" but all the set it's pink color with a hint of extreme feminist ideas. I grew up with barbie dolls and I felt very disappointed, I was expecting a different kind of story, the ending was the worst. I think the message should be more with the real feminist concept of Simone de Bouvoir, we all deserve the same rights. In the end Instead of just Barbie Land they should changed as; Barbie and Ken Land.Definitely is not the best movie of Greta.I enjoyed the music, the set and loved the clothes. Although I excepted to hear the Aqua song! Why it wasn't played in the movie.Anyway its not a bad movie, it's just good movie."
"For a film like ""Barbie"" to succeed, every aspect had to come together perfectly. It needed to consummately balance satire with fun, the casting had to be spot-on, and the writing/directing required to pull off such a feat would need to be exquisite. Somewhat remarkably, that is exactly what writer/director Greta Gerwig pulls off here to create the best movie of summer 2023.For a very basic overview, ""Barbie"" sees its titular character (played by Margot Robbie) living her stereotypically perfect life in Barbieland. Well, that is until she is plagued by those pesky intrusive thoughts of death, a flattening of her perfectly-heeled feet, and a trip to Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) to figure out what is going on. As it turns out, a rift has developed between Barbieland and the real world that only Stereotypical Barbie--accompanied by Beach Ken (Ryan Gosling)--can mend. But when Barbie & Ken have extremely different experiences in the real world, it leads to even more messiness between the worlds that precipitates further adventure/hijinks.In terms of plot, somehow Gerwig manages to write and direct her way into the perfect tone with ""Barbie"". A mere mention of the term ""patriarchy"" in today's polarized landscape will more often than not lead to a line in the sand that neither side will cross, yet Gerwig perfectly examines and satirizes the subject by making the proceedings just so darn fun. Much like, say, Jordan Peele before her did with horror flicks like ""Get Out"" or ""Us"", Gerwig uses a genre other than straight-up drama to get her satire and story themes across here. Sometimes, that proves to be the best ""delivery service"" and it is certainly true in this case.Of course, solid/unique actors are required to carry out this quirky film's shenanigans and softer moments, and ""Barbie"" comes up aces in that department too. Robbie is perfectly cast as the lead, with both her beauty and dramatic acting chops lending themselves to the film's own dual nature. But more often than not it is Gosling who steals the show every time he's on screen. To do what Gerwig wants to do with ""Barbie"", the Ken role has to be perfect--and is here in the versatile style of Gosling (one of Hollywood's most underappreciated acting talents). The rest of the cast is also filled with solid performances and wonderfully fun cameos.""Barbie"" is just as much a visual treat as anything else--they didn't short the area of pink paint for no reason. DP Rodrigo Pieto creates a universe that is a sight to behold in every frame and then transitions some of those characters into a real-world environment with similar panache. All of this is of course given some drive by a killer soundtrack featuring the likes of Lizzo, Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish, and even Gosling himself!Not only do I feel that ""Barbie"" eclipsed (even if narrowly in some cases) the bigger blockbusters like ""The Flash"", ""Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning 1"", & ""Oppenheimer"", but it subsequently vaulted Gerwig into the upper echelon of my must-see writers/directors (alongside Nolan, Villeneuve, Peele, etc.). After not knowing exactly what to expect from this film going in, I was utterly blown away by this experience."
"I personally expected the movie to be fun and adventurous. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that what it is supposed to be? It's literally a movie about Barbie. Instead, it felt more like an agent of woke culture, and basically Mattel's (the company that produces Barbie dolls) way of capitalizing the emotional aspect of the cinephiles to make their business more popular and trendier. It continuously tried to portray the fact that Mattel is no more producing white barbie dolls, it is now producing dolls of all colors and races. Well, that is definitely a good thing, but making most of the movie focus on that aspect felt very boring and wrong. If they didn't quite make a movie that is fun and adventurous, why make the marketing events misleading? They could've just focused on the audience for whom it was made, rather than on the entire world through their absurdly irrelevant marketing events that made the world think that this movie is going to be all about fun and adventure. Sadly, it was not nearly as enjoyable as the misleading marketing made it seem."
"I wanted to like it. But I just didn't. The story wasn't very compelling to me because it seemed as if the entire point of much of the movie was to provide learning moments for viewers with some slapstick comedy and quick-delivery comedy. The story itself should nearly always be more important.All of the goofiness largely would have been excused to me if the comedic moments were really funny. And the way this film was hyped made me think it was going to be super funny. But I rarely laughed. And that's even more of a shame given the talent assembled for the cast. There also weren't many surprising reveals to the audience when maybe there could have been if things were presented differently.I also found it annoying to see Will Farrell play a similar part to what he played in the Lego Movie. Sure he's a CEO rather than a dad. But he was filling the same evil disciplinarian adult role for a movie about a kid's toy. It just felt lazy to not cast someone else for that part, and just made me wish the movie was able to provide the humor and intrigue that the first Lego movie provided to its audience.I'd rather this film felt like a comedy or dramatic experience which has some relevant takes on feminism and culture than thinly veiled sermon with occasional jokes that land amongst a ton that didn't land.I also felt like the movie had way too many characters and ideas thrown together. There was Barbie, Ken, many other Barbies, many other Kens, the crazy Barbie, the CEOs, the mother, the teen, the narrator and more. And it's not just that they had all of these characters. They also tried to have some learning moments delivered-by or delivered-to a majority of these characters. I felt like they would have been better off trying to deliver all these lessons over 3-5 movies rather than 1. And obviously you don't want it ever to seem like the lessons are being delivered but experiences through the story and the consequences of the actions and stakes created by the characters' decisions. Instead there didn't seem like any stakes because the Barbies didn't seem to fit in the real world and the real people didn't fit in the Barbie world.Honestly my favorite part of the movie was a lot of the Easter egg stuff about odd Barbie products over the years. And Easter eggs shouldn't be the best part of any movie. They should be a bonus to the overall experience of the story."
"I think part of my brain rejects this for being a feature-length toy commercial, but it's a very small part of my brain (and that really wasn't where my mind was for the majority of the movie).Overall, it's probably about as good as an official live-action Barbie movie could ever be, with Greta Gerwig clearly given plenty of freedom to have fun with a property/movie like this. It's bigger in scale than her previous two films (Ladybird and Little Women, both of which I prefer to this by a little), and the scale and creativity of the film really kept the momentum going. It's very funny in parts, and though I guess it's sort of a kid-friendly movie, there are tons of jokes and references that'll go over the heads of younger kids. ""What's a fascist?"" is something I heard a four-year-old ask one of their parents halfway through the movie, and that in itself was kind of funny to hear.Margot Robbie is good as always, and is given a surprising amount to do emotionally. It is Barbie's movie, but Ryan Gosling's Ken often steals the film whenever he's on-screen (as the film's wrapping up, there's a fairly awkward pivot to ""oh yeah, this is Barbie's movie;"" it's even addressed in dialogue). I don't think that's a problem, because he's hilarious - it might be one of the best performances he's ever given. I also don't think his character is used ""just"" to attack men, the way I imagine some people will read into it. Barbie does the most learning and has the biggest character arc, sure, but Ken goes through one too, and I thought they wrapped up that side of things nicely.It's an enjoyable movie that deals with some hefty topics (namedropping plenty of words younger kids won't have even heard before) in a mostly consistent way. Some tonal shifts are jarring, and while the vast majority of jokes land, I don't think all did. It does also feel a bit too directly like a commercial at a couple of points, especially early on, but I did expect that. And it's a testament to the quality of the movie that me and all my anti-consumerist thoughts didn't overpower my mind throughout most of this."
"I cried, I laughed, I dance and I did sing too. What a joyful time I had at the movies watching Barbie. This is a movie to celebrate how diverse and complicated are the humans. The cinematography is a outstanding as well as the production design and the vestuary. The casting seems like made in heaven. I recommend this movie for 11+ years old. And if you have a teen at home, take her with you. Barbie goes from fun to introspection and I love a good comedy that makes you think. Ryan Gosling is the perfect Ken, he does everything in this movie and shines every time he shows up. Margo is a perfect Barbie and got a real sense of the relevance this is going to have."
"Yes. Day by day it becomes more obvious that now the movies are made just because of the income they generate and nothing else. Ok, Barbie itself was not a creative idea, I know. And actually I didn't expect to see something unseen something unique in the first place, all in all it's ""Barbie"".But wouldn't you agree with me in that it could have been excelled better? It totally could have been. This movie has a huge budget. Then why such a mediocre story at best? I'm not saying it was a bad movie as well, but it was just ""ok"". Just that.Nowadays movies have become nothing else but live-actions, sequels and prequels. Now it seems like the only thing matters is to have known faces in your movie and the promotions; and creating a story and excelling it good became the least important components of a movie. Unfortunately, Barbie does not fall short in these criterias."
"SCORE: 7.8/10Letterboxd continues to be goated. The pink heart is a nice touch. Maybe my expectations were a bit too high, but could you blame me? The marketing for this movie was undoubtedly some of the best that has ever been done. The film wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, but there definitely was a feeling of being underwhelmed, which has to do with a lot of things. First, because the marketing was so amazing, it felt like I had seen 75% of the movie already before stepping foot in the theater. The story is good, but I think it really struggled with straddling the line between being a social commentary and being goofy and funny. It did a decent job of both, but each side hindered the ability for the other to have maximum impact. Because of that, it led to a lot of parts feeling forced, almost in an attempt to balance out the levels at very inopportune times. The timing was slightly off and created a couple awkward stretches where you were waiting for something to be funny, but it ended up being serious for a bit too long.With all that said, I still have a fun time with the premiere, and I'm not going to let knowing of all the good parts take away from how good they actually were. The songs were catchy, the vibes were superb, and the cast was amazing. Michael Cera as Allan and his involvement in the story was definitely a nice surprise. However, to no surprise, the stars of the show, me and Margot Robbie...I mean Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie killed it as Ken and Barbie. As a man, I thought the jabs at men were hilarious and warranted. The best type of comedy is relatable comedy, and I think they did a good job with it. The references to other movies were also cool, especially their dig at Zack Snyder's Justice League. The Film Bros are going to HATE this movie. The set pieces for this film were very impressive, and Greta Gerwig seems like an amazing human being.My criticisms of this movie are not to be taken as me being disappointed or even that I didn't like parts of it. I think I just saw the potential this movie had and it flashed it to us occasionally, but ultimately fell short. I am happy to be living in a time where Barbenheimer is happening and we can celebrate cinema together, but I have a feeling that Oppenheimer is going to blow this thing out of the water, no pun intended. If you look at my Perfect Score Ranking, you will see that I am not shy to express my more ""feminine"" side and appreciate movies that maybe most men wouldn't. I was really expecting for this film to be a huge hit for me, but it ended up just being good. Which is okay! I definitely still recommend for people to see it, and I will be jamming to the songs of the soundtrack in my car. Well done Greta and team!"
"Before making Barbie (2023), Greta Gerwig single-handedly directed two films: Lady Bird (2017) and Little Women (2019). Both were about girls on the precipice of adolescence, both had nuanced and layered portrayals of mother-daughter relationships, both combined imaginative visuals with clever dialogue. Both were very, very good. Given those credentials, one may expect Barbie to be as intelligent, convincing and amusing a picture - and, well, it isn't.The fantasy comedy begins in Barbie Land, a place where Barbie (played by Margot Robbie) is having the best day every day, in the company of other Barbies and, occasionally, Kens. The designs, costumes, and cinematography do an excellent job re-creating the Mattel vision in its pink plastic perfection. The introduction is referential but not overtly reliant on what is external to the film; it is smartly self-aware and presents a world where Barbie can be anything - a President, a Physicist, a Journalist, a Lawyer, or a Mermaid. Much like with the original toys, Ken (Ryan Gosling) comes as an afterthought and 'only exists within the warmth of Barbie's gaze'.The plot is set in motion when Barbie begins having thoughts about death and, normally suspended in the state of standing on the balls of her feet, she feels her heels hit the ground. What follows is The Wizard of Oz (1939) journey in reverse (the parallel is explicit) and, ultimately, a Pinocchio storyline of the doll in the Real World.If Barbie was fully dedicated to that conceit - as promised by the trailer - it could be an interesting exploration in the way of The Truman Show (1998) or Stranger Than Fiction (2006). Instead, the film chooses to introduce a handful of conflicts, threats, and plot-lines that are never fully realised. What is the nature of the connection between a Barbie and the girl who plays with the doll in the Real World? What would happen if Barbie were put back in the box? Why is Gloria (America Ferrera), the receptionist at the Mattel headquarters and, later, Barbie's Real-World companion, depressed - and how is that eventually resolved? Why is Gloria's daughter Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) cross with her mother? Why does the board of Mattel spend one third of the film hiding in the bushes? Most importantly, the crux of the third-act conflict - set in Barbie Land now renamed 'Kendom' - contradicts what had been previously established about that world and its inhabitants.Towards the finale, the production evolves into explicit commentary on gender roles. One side is presented as clueless and attention-seeking, while the other is manipulative and vengeful. The film repeatedly takes offence with 'mansplaining', yet behaves in a blithely patronising manner towards the viewer. Much of what is declared is not supported by what has been shown, and the picture relies on the presumed prior experience of the audience, rather than on storytelling. While the denouement includes one of the film's highlights, the musical number 'I'm Just Ken', the ending does not resolve (or acknowledge) much, and the final scene is reductive to the point of being offensive.Barbie is very easy on the eye, and the acting ranges from competent to inspired, with praiseworthy performances by the leading actors. Margot Robbie is pitch-perfect as Barbie, and Ryan Gosling shines as her counterpart, often stealing the show. Situational comedy and slapstick mostly land, while some of the bon mots are funny, yet hardly plausible when spoken by the characters.If only this were better written. If only the joyride in the pink convertible did not leave you with blond hair in your mouth."
"Wow. WOW!!!!My favorite movie of all time is Aliens. It's been my favorite movie since I was 5-years-old. I'm 38 now. That has NEVER changed.Until THIS.And I bet you are thinking this review is satire. It's NOT.I'm BLOWN away. Barbie is now my favorite movie of all time - successfully unseating Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. I never thought I would see the day.The movie makes you think it's going to be just a fun, silly movie to mock. NO. It's not. It's brilliantly written. It's written so well that all the adult messaging goes right over the little kids heads but still gives them plenty of enjoyment.The movie sparked really great discussion with my daughter who is 8-years-old. We discussed why it's so important to value ourselves and what the patriarchy is. It's just... mind blowingly good.And also - a good reminder to all women. WE ARE ENOUGH. We are good enough. And we need to raise our daughters to be confident and leaders if that's the path they choose."
"Even though I'm not the target audience for this movie, I thought Barbie might impress me due to Greta Gerwig's previous works but I'm disappointed.The main problem is that the overall message isn't clear. This doesn't go to say that the movie is frivolous. What happens is that it gets lost trying to explore multiple meaningful topics and never reaches the punchline. It addresses relevant themes like patriarchy, sexism, gender roles, existencialism, imperfection, individuality and identity but always on a shallow level. Every scene in this script tries to convince you that it's saying something profound when in reality it sacrifices depth and character development in favor of cheap humor, which results in an immature and non-compelling production.In contrast, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were perfectly casted and their performances are as good as the screenplay allows them to be. The production and costume design from Barbie Land are noteworthy too.Hopefully Greta Gerwig will release other movies in the future as brilliant as Lady Bird, which I genuinely think deserves 5 stars."
"I Understand that Some People are Going to Have Big Big Problems with Some of the Messaging within this Film. But Sometimes, in Life 😂, You Just Have to Go With It.Hashtag NUMBER 1 Lesson You Should Take From this Film: Build, Hone, Grow, and then Come Together and Become KENOUGH! (Both Guys and Girls)Greta Gerwig Nailed this Thing!I was just sitting Their Watching it and I was like ""Man, I'm Actually Enjoying what the hell is going on here"" 🤣Things I Liked About The Film -1. Firstly, the Plotline and More Importantly, the Execution of this Plotline is Great imo. It's Interesting and Kept me Engaged from Point to Point. It hits the points it needs to hit with it's Comedic Tone and Some Serious Moments too. The Balance is Laced in and Out of the Film and is just about PERFECT. (Again, People are Going to have Problems with Certain Things)2. Secondly, the Aesthetics are so Good. It is Such a Unique Watch. You Won't See Anything Like It. What a Watch! WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE!3. The Tone 🏩 and the Way much of the Dialogue is Delivered is Fitting For this Film.4. The Cinematography and Some of the Shots at Times are So Good. It's Gorgeous.5. Margot Robbie Literally Perfects This Role as Barbie. Her Acting, Her Tone, Her Look. 🌸 Not to Mention Some of her Costuming (Pink Cowboy Outfit) 🤠 makes Her Look Out of This World.6. Ryan Gosling Nails it. He was Absolutely Hilarious at Times (Especially in the 3RD Act)7. Much of the Comedy Landed for me (Comedy is Subjective, so also, Some Didn't) and from what I Heard, it Landed for a Lot of the Audience I was with. (Beached off Wasn't Funny, but after That, The Laughs Started Coming in). (4th Wall Ugly Joke, Margot Is the Wrong Example for this, was the Biggest Laugh in the theatre 😆)8. So to Summarise, I Really Liked the Beach Battle, The Dance Scenes, the Plotline, The Comedy, the Tone, The Aesthetics and the Atmosphere in that Theatre whilst Watching this Thing.From what I watched, it was Well Put Together, Well Excecuted and everything Came Together So Well. And that Cherry on Top Quip 🍒🎂 from Margot Robbie was Just 👌Overall, if You have Problems with the Some of the Messaging, You will Not Enjoy it, Bottom Line. (Guys, You don't have to agree or Take any of the Messaging to Heart, just go with it, Become Kenough and Extract that Entertainment Factor For Your Own Enjoyment) (Ladies, Take Some of the Positive Messages From this Film because there are Some Genuinely Positive Messages in Here)"
"I loved barbie growing up, and even at 42 years old I couldn't wait to go see the movie! I didn't have any expectations because I had no idea how they could make a movie about barbie that's for adults and not kids. I adored Barbieland, but unfortunately they leave it behind so fast and with it they also leave behind everything good about bringing barbie to life in a movie! It got silly, had no storyline, was overly political and woke, man bashing and made men silly, and I really didn't care for the ending which is just as well because it was abrupt and crude.The music is good, but I wasn't prepared for a musical and it became that for some unknown reason at one point.Ryan Gosling as Ken stole the show. He looked like he was having the time of his life making this movie!Margot Robbie is perfect as Barbie but it wasn't that interesting to watch and I didn't understand why she was being forced to get in the box and what would happen if she did get in."
"Despite the strong commercial tone, it is still possible to perceive that we are watching a film by Greta Gerwig, director known for dramatic comedies that capture the complexity of femininity in an original way - although, in this case, it is almost inevitable to fall into some clichés. The undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. ""Barbie"" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the ""corporate"" issue. It won't be strange if you catch yourself thinking ""how did Mattel let this film see the light of day?"" Laughing at yourself, after all, seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itself.In the debate proposal for important social disparities in the face of the artificial tackiness of the Barbie Universe, the direction manages to create precious dialogues and situations, very well dosed with humor and other variations of the dramatic genre that permeate the acts of the project. In these changes of atmosphere, we were able to appreciate the creative photography by Rodrigo Prieto - who shoots 50 shades of pink in the same scene without making us want to vomit - and the dozens of visual references that influenced the director in the aesthetic configuration, between composition of scenes and very particular plastic choices, such as costume pieces, type of hair or cinephile jokes that we had already had contact with since the trailer parodying 2001: A Space Odyssey. Here, we'll catch glimpses of ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""The Truman Show""; we'll go through the fairytale-like artificiality of Jacques Demy's films; for the dance and choreographic performance of Gene Kelly; for the visual and dramatic intensity of The Little Red Shoes and All That Jazz... it's a lot. ""Barbie"" is a well of enriching cinematographic references.But, leaving aside that the film is indeed fun and has a creative and stunning look, in addition to addressing important points of today's society, Greta Gerwig ends up exaggerating her hand and transforms ""Barbie"" into a blatant and extremely exaggerated feminist activism. The production is very much in line with a famous Quentin Tarantino interview in 2021 given to Bill Maher on his HBO broadcast ""Real Time"" in which he said: ""Ultimately, ideology trumps art, individual effort, good, entertainment"". Unfortunately, in this film, this doll that belonged to the imagination of several generations of women was dragged into the cultural war, used as a puppet by political militancy, full of language, allegories, open messages and ideological discourses. The film misses an opportunity to be a film for everyone, to be a comedy and romance epic, and it had the quality to do so, but it preferred to focus on the most brazen militancy that cinema has ever produced, trying to please a specific audience and clearly attack certain targets of this ideological patrol.The film has an interesting premise, that's undeniable, and it flows most of the time, but the audience is bombarded with pervasive indoctrination especially in the art scene at every turn. Since the target audience here is females of all ages, this audience may even enter the cinema wanting to be entertained, but will graduate in all subjects addressed among feminists: an ode to the intrinsic evil of patriarchy; criticism of beauty standards; the hypocritical discourse against consumerism (as if Warner, Mattel, artists were not going to profit millions from movie ticket sales, from selling new dolls, etc.); man-hatred (all men portrayed in the film are portrayed as idi*ts, gr*edy, d*mb, or wanting power for themselves). Greta Gerwig's goal as a screenwriter is super smart in this regard, because the ""Stereotyped"" Barbie comes to the real world completely innocent and she is being indoctrinated following the feminist primer that shows how she has to think and act, mainly in the perception of men and progressive militancy - the character Sasha, played by Ariana Greenblatt, is the one who plays this role, like the militant of today, always connected and who knows everything about life (where Gerwig puts her speech in the mouth of the character so that she speaks her true s intentions).The truth is that the film essentially revolves around hate, not love. Barbie, here, hates men, capitalism, fun and hates Barbie doll herself (calling her a fascist and worse throughout the plot). Barbie also hates women who have cute memories of the doll, if you're a woman and you played with her as a kid, according to the movie, you supported patriarchy. Barbie can't just be a pretty, blonde, thin woman either, after all, that doesn't encompass the mandatory ""diversity and inclusion"" in Hollywood today. To resolve this issue, they created a universe in which everyone is Barbie (we even have a Barbie who was born a man, yes, a trans Barbie - who, by the way, is a doctor). The men in Barbieland (who cares) are there to be mistreated and ignored. Ken is just an accessory. When Barbie and Ken come into the real world, everything changes. Ken discovers patriarchy (a word spoken a dozen times throughout the plot) and likes that world. Barbie finds unbridled machismo (if Barbie were set in the 60s it would even make a little sense). Romance between Barbie and Ken? Not at all, after all that wouldn't be ""empowering"" at all. Ken even rejects the doll at one point.Ken represents the ""evil patriarchy"". Everything in this film becomes one big lecture, one big sermon (Barbie scolding workers who whistle at her; police officers harassing Barbie at the police station; a man slapping her on the butt out of the blue), that is, victim of the ""toxic"" men of the world. Barbie still has to choose between flip-flops and heels, showing that in the end there is only one choice to be made: follow feminism, that is, flip-flops. We also have the passage of the protagonist Gloria cheating on her husband (a fool, by the way), and the film shows that the betrayal was legal and she had an advantage in cheating.All male clichés are portrayed here according to the feminist view (because apparently men have had no problems in life since the beginning of time, according to the film's script). Here, the Barbies were co-opted by the brainwashing of patriarchy and used by the Kens in a kind of macho dystopia. Everything Ken likes is depicted as toxic, evil, and terrible (Stallone, Godfather, horses, Zack Snyder, etc.). Barbieland is portrayed as a perfect world for women (women have everything, men have nothing); Mattel executives are all portrayed as white, straight men and still calls this type of profile ""conservative fascist"". For the director, it is never enough to be a woman, you have to be a mother, a wife, work and still receive criticism. The unsuspecting will also believe that even today women do not have leadership positions in large companies, and that they cannot study, work and that they receive lower wages than men doing the same type of work (Yes, because apparently the ""evil businessmen"" hire men to pay higher wages when they could pay less for a woman to do the same job!!). At the end of the plot, Gloria's feminist discourse is the antidote to the brainwashing of oppressive patriarchy. Kens are beaten because they are ""d*mb"". The Barbies plan was to pretend to be submissive and then make their respective Ken jealous with another Ken, of course, after all, all men only know how to create wars, destroy everything they lay their hands on and are automatically stupid (After all, if men are stupid, why do they dominate the world according to what was propagated in the film? A basic and inexplicable plot hole here).""Barbie"" is a great satire, but when it touches on feminist issues, it gets serious and uses irony to make fun of men, since women are portrayed as being totally perfect. Sasha and Gloria are the main Latin characters here and the Barbie character is just the shell for the director to propagate her feminist ideas. Obviously, the film will have an excellent box office due to all the hype and marketing made for the film and, of course, the popularity of the Barbie doll that has been successful for generations, in addition to having many merits, especially in the technical part. The detailed, creative and extremely tasteful scenarios, especially in Barbieland, are a spectacle in themselves, in addition to the magnificent performances by Margot Robbie (charismatic and incredibly beautiful) and Ryan Gosling (hilarious as ever). The musicals, on the other hand, are horrible, poorly performed and owing a lot in that regard.""Barbie"" talks about choices and changes. In the hands of Greta Gerwig, the typical behavior of dolls and dolls, via imagination, takes on a critical form and points to many paths, visiting metalanguage, political-social relations, patriarchy and feminism, feelings (including the arrogant and insensitive posture of Barbie in front of Ken; as well as the unhealthy dependence of the doll on his girlfriend), existential crises or acceptance of one's social and gender condition. The work fulfilled the promise that we would have a product different from what could be imagined from a live-action Barbie, that is undeniable. The problem is that, in the end, Barbie doesn't even get a satisfactory answer to the simplest question of her journey of self-discovery. ""Who is Barbie?"""
"It's an incredibly fun movie. Lots of laughs. Very campy over the top humour. But also surprisingly touching. My favourite scene of the movie is just rather a small quiet moment where Barbie is observing every day life and tells an old woman how beautiful she is. Margot Robbie shines in the lead role. Ryan Gosling clearly was having a lot of fun with the role, but don't sleep on Michael Cera as Allan. I know a lot of people say that Ryan Gosling is a scene stealer, but personally I thought Michael was.The soundtrack also works really within the film. I don't know how many of them I would listen to separately. I also wouldnt be suprised if either ""Im just Ken"" or ""What was I made for?"" or both was nominated for an oscar. Speaking of oscars, I think this is also has a good chance of being nominated for production design, costumes, hair and makeup - because visually this movie is such a treat.Now I dont think all aspects worked for me. I don't think the Mattel/CEO subplot was needed. There could have been another way for her to go back to Barbieland organically. I felt like the film was already tackling a lot with themes of patriarchy and feminism and having this ""chase scene"" didnt add much. Also, Gloria's (America Ferrera) monologue. Now, dont get me wrong I think there is a lot truth to it. But I just found it somewhat one-note. It didn't exactly blow me away as it has for others. And lastly, I undertstand the importance of having Ruth Handler featured in the movie....just a little weird that it was represented as her being a ghost that lives in Mattel headquarters.Overall, I would definitely recommend the film. You'll laugh, you'll cry. You'll have fun. This isn't just a movie, it is the moment."
"But it is also in its smallest details, from the art direction, costumes, and any technical choice completely thought of referencing all Barbie generations and the like. A soundtrack that will take you from laughing to crying (yes, very musical moments, after all it is a Barbie movie), in addition to the hand-picked cast, Margot is impeccable and manages to express all her feelings, just with her eyes. Greta's direction and screenplay, just amazing, strong, emotional, empowering and very, very feminist, not only for the women who are already fighting for the cause, but to open everyone's eyes to a sisterhood."
"I saw this movie tonight and it was very entertaining but if your a parent and have young Children THEY WILL GET BORED as this is not a kids movie, it is on a higher intellectual plain than that. You could honestly say this is a movie for feminists, now thats not a bad thing as I saw it with my daughter and have always encouraged her to be whoever she wanted to be and played with Barbie when she was young (she's 23 now) .This movie has it's moments of comedy and is well done especially when in the Barbie world and has been well thought out and written. Cast very well as the two leads carry the movie and i'm sure there will be a sequel. But remember this is not a KIDS movie."
"I appreciated it but wasn't a huge fan of Greta Gerwig's first two films. I knew absolutely nothing about Barbie except that it was a doll. The trailers didn't impress me. I slept less than an hour last night. I watched the movie alone surrounded by teenagers who cheered when the WB logo appeared in pink.The conditions were set for this to go wrong, but Gerwig's vision for Barbie won me over. The film starts in the perfect, goofy, and funny Barbie Land, but it doesn't take long to move to the real world. Curiously, while most of the action in the real world works well, it's also where I felt some issues, mainly with the Mattel executives' characters. Let's say it was the only time I felt that the silliness of the film (and it's indeed very silly) went too far. The third act wraps everything up perfectly, with some fantastic speeches and a strong conclusion. Margot Robbie is great in the role of Barbie, but there's a big surprise in America Ferrera, and Ryan Gosling steals all the attention whenever he's on screen. All the supporting cast is hilarious.Younger audiences will love the colours, the incredible production design, and the light tone. However, this is a very adult film in the themes it addresses, managing to be highly relevant without ever ceasing to entertain. The feminist traits are well-defined, and it's an homage to women, but not only that. It's primarily about self-discovery, finding our own path, and being true to ourselves."
"As a guy who never played with Barbie dolls, I was surprised to be caught up in the enthusiasm to see this movie; I purchased tickets well in advance when they first went on sale.It's amazing to think that, a few years back, Amy Schumer was going to star in the title role. Though after seeing Margot Robbie, it's hard to imagine anyone else in that spot.Anyway ... like most moviegoers - I enjoyed this movie. It's a lot like The Lego Movie with its high energy, colorful world-building, meta jokes, self-aware characters and variety of insider (fan) humor. The ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" beginning, (clearly aimed at adult viewers) was priceless.However unlike The Lego Movie I can definitely say that the first half was enormously more entertaining compared to the second. The first half was energized by all the Barbie accessories, character introductions, high-energy music and a very cool plot reveal involving the ""real world"".But unlike The Lego Movie, the second half (while not bad) wasn't able to keep the momentum going. While there was a lot of action and drama ... it felt more hit-and-miss.The message was good: you don't have to be perfect to be happy ... just be true to yourself. However, its delivery felt a bit too complex for kids - and maybe even for some adults.The empowering commentary about womanhood was eloquent ... but it seemed like the writers had trouble getting from that point to a strong and uplifting ending. It almost felt a bit melancholy for whatever reason.But - don';t let that stop you from enjoying this movie! There's a lot to like and it's kind of a cultural moment and opportunity to connect with all the Barbie-love that spans generations. Enjoy this experience with a big audience and you'll be glad you did."
"Okay maybe it was a 9.5 because of two flaws: First was the Will Ferrell character and his board that made their point but then became superfluos. Second was that it is definitely not a kids' movie (although maybe they would see things that I didn't - I mean to be fair, the few kids in the theatre were well behaved so perhaps the movie got their full attention as well).But why did I enjoy it? Simply amazing visuals, Margot Robbie looked flawlessly gorgeous and played it perfectly. Ryan Gosling was also brilliant in this. Great music, great pacing and then there was the script. There were a lot of messages in this film that trod a tightrope between pithy, ironic, sarcastic and cliched. But I reckon they just about managed it which, considering the subject matter, was quite an accomplishment. I will need to see it a second time to check whether the messages were balanced and as meaningful as they were meant to be but I hope that women were as upbeat about it as i was. Overall, on an enjoyment level alone, it deserves its high score from me."
"POSITIVES:1) Ryan Gosling completely steals the film for me. He's hilarious, but also completely sells the emotional moments too. A great performance 2) The film had several moments that made me laugh out loud. A lot of the humour is very clever, as can be expected from these two great writers. I should also say that I think the emotional moments were written very well too, particularly Barbie and Ken's 'breakup' at the end, which I thought was the best scene in the film 3) The production design and costume design were both terrific and will probably win their respective OscarsNEGATIVES:1) There are multiple times where the film was far too goofy for me. Examples include the chase scene in the Mattel headquarters and the car chase scene that follows it 2) The message, whilst respectable in a way, was just far too on the nose for me at times. When it was done subtly it felt clever and interesting, but then when they just did big monologues at the end it just became too over the top 3) The film felt quite dated for me. If this had came out in the 90s or 2000s I feel like it would've been much more impactful and relevant, whereas nowadays not many kids play with Barbie dolls and the male-dominated society is nowhere near as prevalent."
"Weeks ago I heard that there was going to be a Barbie movie coming out and my immediate first thought was ""Oh, God."" I then forgot about it and then saw the trailer for it when we went to see the new Indiana Jones movie. I always enjoy seeing Margot Robbie when I can and Ryan Gosling looked like he was going to bring some humor to the movie, so when my wife asked if I wanted to see it, I said SURE! I'm glad I did.The movie was as amusing as I hoped, and it didn't overly rely on tired story lines to make it entertaining. What it also had was a lot of heart. Margot Robbie is an actress that has a ton of sex appeal, but she doesn't use it. She uses her great skill as an actress to convey the story and does it very well.What was really fun about this movie was listening to the kids in the theater responding to it and it was pretty hilarious. My daughter and I were laughing more at that than anything. It was actually a delightful surprise that added to the whole vibe of the movie.Ryan Gosling played a goofball Ken, but he does so in a very controlled and amusing way, and you actually feel for Ken bigtime as the story moves along. He did a great job as well as the rest of the cast that made up all the Barbies and Kens.The only thing I will say takes away from this movie is Will Ferrell. I normally find him amusing in most movies he is in, but in this one, he was completely superfluous. He added not a single laugh nor important aspect to the story line. He just was not needed in this movie.So, if you have a daughter of any age, go see it with her and laugh. It's truly a good time."
"I really wanted to enjoy this and I know that I am not the target audience but there were massive plot holes and no real flow. The film was very disjointed. Ryan Gosling as good as he is seemed to old to play Ken and Will Ferrell ruined every scene he was in. I just didn't get it, it seemed hollow artificial and hackneyed. A waste of some great talent. It was predictable without being reassuring and trying so hard to be woke in the most superficial way in that but trying to tick so many boxes it actually ticked none. Margo Robbie looks beautiful throughout, the costumes and the sets were amazing but the story was way too weak and didn't make much sense at all."
"The brilliant marketing is what led us tonight to pay for the tickets. The brilliance ends there.Performance of the lead actors is very good - as good as you may expect given the very poor story and weak directing. And that's it. The humour is forced. The satire is replaced by lectures conveyed by characters. All the ""bad"" characters are absolutely flat, lacking any depth. Even dancing is very poorly choreographed. Whatever you may expect from the trailers is missing in the movie.The photography is good though. So the average is 5/10
It is another plainly bad movie that is trying to hide behind agenda."
"The Margot Robbie/Ryan Gosling curiosity BARBIE is a subversive film. This Greta Gerwig directed move lures you in by presenting a farcical/satirical look at the pastel colored ""Barbieland"" and the myriad of outfits and ""golly-gosh"" goodness of the world of this iconic Mattel doll (and her boyfriend, Ken). Once you are comfortably settled into this world, you are transformed to the ""real world"" and the much deeper themes of a women's place in a patriarchal world.As another toy's slogan puts it, ""there's more than meets the eye"" to this film.And one should have expected something more than just a ""surfacey-fun"" film from the Writer/Director of such fare as LADYBIRD and FRANCES HA. Gerwing uses the stereotypes of Barbie and Ken to take a look at our society and the inherent hierarchy of the sexes while peeling back the layers of the key players to make them more than the plastic dolls they portray.And...it works surprisingly well for adults - not so much for kids.Margot Robbie, of course, is perfectly cast as the titular Barbie. She has the looks and the vacuous devil-may-care attitude of ""Stereotype Barbie"" and is a comfortable, pleasing entity to share this adventure with. But, with Gerwig's direction, Robbie's performance reveals, subtly, layer after layer until - at the end - we end up with a full fledged character and not just a living doll.Ryan Gosling is just as strong as Barbie's counterpart, Ken. He morphs from a Barbie worshipping boyfriend to something else once he encounters the real, male-dominated world. The BankofMarquis wondered why Gosling would agree to do a film that, on it's surface, appears to be a one-note joke-fest, but once the film really drives to it's point, one can see why Gosling agreed to be in this.Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Simu Liu, Michael Cerra, Helen Mirren (as the narrator) and America Ferrara all spark - at times - during this film while it was good to see Rhea Perlman (Carla on CHEERS) have a role that she could sink her teeth into.Only Will Ferrell - as the money hungry CEO of Mattel - falls short of interesting. His character - one of the only ""real world"" characters in this film - stays stereotypical throughout the movie. He is the only complete caricature in this film...and perhaps that is on purpose.Credit for the surprising depth of this film goes to Gerwig who brings her sensibilities to this film to make a comment on our society. It's a bold move by Gerwig and works well...unless you are a Mom that is bringing your 5 or 6 year old child to this film.And, that is the caution to this movie. It's not, necessarily, made for the youngsters that play with Barbies. The kids will love the early going of this film, but the more adult themes in the middle of the movie will probably make a good deal of them squirm in their seats, since these moments of depth will go over their heads.A surprisingly fun...and deeper than it appears to be....film, this Barbie is a multi-level dreamhouse.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the BankofMarquis."
Let me start by saying it makes me happy to see a movie that isn't from the MCU or a sequel doing so well at the box office. There is still originality out there. This movie was very funny - the scene with Ken and the doctor in LA made me laugh very hard. It's weird and inventive. It has amazing choreography. So many talented people worked on this. I didn't grow up with Barbies so I'm sure a lot of the jokes went over my head. But it didn't hurt the enjoyment. It even manages to land a sentimental note at the end. I can definitely see this being a movie people see over and over.Side note: Greta Gerwig must be a fan of Sex Education - three actors end up here.
"I really enjoyed the movie. The acting was amazing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling was amazing. I just thought it was too on the nose. Like the message was literally forced in your face. It seemed lazy to me. I went in thinking it was going to be similar to The Truman Show and I wished it had've taken some elements from it because it would've made it much more powerful if so. I'm not going to spoil the ending but I thought the writers just gave up. Overall for me it's a 6/10. Good film but that's all. Definitely could've been less preachy. Ultimately, it's nice movie to see and I'd see it again at some point but it wasn't great."
"If you told me a few years ago that one of the best movies in 2023, and arguably the highest-grossing one is going to be Barbie, I would have laughed and called you crazy. But here we are, and the atmosphere in the theatre felt like a cultural revolution, which can become ""You just had to be there"" moment for the Gen-Zs.Through the medium of this film, Greta Gerwig expresses the frustrations of all women, and at the same time presents a satirical take on patriarchy. The movie praises Barbie for being a feminist icon, but at the same acknowledges it's regressiveness. Ken is basically every man who embodies patriarchal ideals just for being rejected, as he feels accepted in the real world but gets ignored in the Barbieland, which was a stark reflection on how women feel in the real world. At the end, it has a beautiful message for all women.The script is genuinely funny with bucket-load of hilarious moments and lines. Ryan Gosling brings his A-game as Ken, saying that his expressions are hilarious would be an understatement. Ryan has basically understood the assignment. Margot Robbie was basically born to play the role of Barbie, as she fits into the role to a T. You can feel her as she is going through an existential crisis.The set-design and costumes were praiseworthy and clearly deserves an Oscar nod. The costumes of each Barbies and Kens have been designed so beautifully and intricately, that it bears a mention. The buildings in Barbieland have also been created with love and passion for the universe. The architecture of the movie is a visual treat for the audience.The cinematography of the film does a good job of presenting the Barbie with glitz and glitter. It is pink and completely unapologetic about it.The soundtrack is an icing on the cake. 'I am just Ken' is still stuck on my mind, as I am penning down this review. However, I do feel that the supporting cast was wasted, as thsy had very little to do.In conclusion, the movie is a popcorn-muncher but at the same time delivers a heartfelt message which is very important for the world."
"I was pretty excited to see this film and hope I'm not going to get put on a list for saying I didn't enjoy it that much. The message of female empowerment was fine, but didn't really speak to gender equality. Barbieland is the opposite of real world where Barbies are in control and kens are perceived as the mindless accessories. However, the ending just puts Barbies back on top and doesn't do much to equality which I hope is our goal. The movie itself was very sloppy and all finish with no build up. You could tell the writers had ideas of what they wanted to have happen but had zero clue how to get there. They wanted Ken to take the patriarchy back to Barbieland but this happens immediately and off screen despite the Kens being bumbling morons the entire movie. It's all payoff and no buildup. Good acting from a strong cast made this more fun to watch but when you start thinking a little deeper it didn't make much sense. I think this was a made for tik tok movie where there's 100 great scenes to throw up on the internet but not very cohesive when put together."
"It's really something different but some of it feels inspired by other films, I caught references to Fight Club, 2001 Space Odyssey, Lego Movie, and others I can't think of at the moment. But yeah, this was a special film. I don't think as many people will like it as it probably deserves. But I did love most of it. Sometimes the tones felt off at times but it's definitely recommended to see. The satire works great here and the production design, cinematography and acting (intentionally bad in a way on purpose in some spots to deliver the satire aspects) are all perfectly done here though overall. The music is a highlight here too which is sometimes hilarious and reminded me of the Lego movie in some ways. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are both pitch perfect here as well. Definitely recommend anyone to give it a chance. I wouldn't say this is a family movie but I think families with older kids would work perfectly for this. Not sure this will be in the Oscar race but it seems like it will at least for technical aspects and production designs."
"Im not really disappointed or love the movie to be honest. It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. Its good anyway."
"Brilliantly written by Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach. Everyone in this is fantastic. It's a wink at nostalgia and commentary on society. Never played with Barbies but my daughter did. Tribute to the inventor of Barbie, Ruth Handler. Helen Mirren narrates. Kate McKinnon almost steals the movie. Not a movie for little kids but most of the references will probably go over their heads. My girlfriend and I laughed out loud many times. It's about 20 minutes too long for my taste. The music is spot on. It's a perfect summer movie. Guess what? It has value and substance. Margot Robbie is not only gorgeous but more importantly, she's highly intelligent as actor and producer. This movie is going to make bank!"
"I wasn't dying to see this, but I felt like I had to participate in the Barbenheimer phenomenon, and the trailer looked good, so I went. I went in with reasonably high expectations because the reviews were high and it has a good cast and crew behind it. I was slightly disappointed.I enjoy Robbie's acting, and I also like Will Ferrell (who doesn't), it's got some good chuckles, the screenplay is solid. The soundtrack is also pretty good.Now, what's bad about it? Well, I felt like a film like this would be a tad more realistic then it was. This felt like an animated film inside a live action film. I feel like there were some parts that were unnecessary.Well, it was pretty good. If you want a comedy, you'd like this one.NOTE: Although I enjoyed both, I think Oppenheimer reigns superior to Barbie."
"I had great expectations for the Barbie movie, mainly because of the writers (Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach) and the stellar cast with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling leading the way. Unfortunately I found myself disappointed, bored and shocked by some messages the movie tries to convey.Starting with what I liked, the performances were great and in particular Ryan Gosling was spectacular with a wide range of emotions and a lot of humor displayed. Also the design of the sets was inspired with a lot of references to the Barbie world and the style was unique and recognisable. Finally some jokes landed pretty well and the movie (in the first half) is pretty funny. And the positives end here.Unfortunately the negatives are much more important. Sorted in a order of increasing gravity:
* some plot lines are bad and are closed so quickly that it would have been better not to include them in the first place. In particular I am referring to the mother/daughter one and the one about Mattel. Furthermore, the Mattel one is also a bit strange since it is useful to criticise however uses feminism to make money, while being a movie that does exactly that.* the film becomes boring in the second half. This is due to a systematic shift in tone and style since if in the first part the satire is sharp and elegant and leads to numerous bittersweet laughs, in the second half instead the movie becomes full of exposition. There are a lot of scenes where things are directly explained to the viewer (clearly considered a bit stupid) and there are some too long monologues that are both cringe and painfully written. This is a pity because some ideas explored in the second half are interesting, but due to this shift ""Barbie"" becomes so boring to enjoy them.* the messages: I found some messages the movie is trying to convey pretty baffling. First of all the film is not about parity, but rather about gender fight and I don't think this is the correct idea to give to younger viewers. I want that children/young adults get that as a society we want equal rights and opportunities, not to fight to be the dominant genere. This is also true because of the fact that there's no a single positive male figure throughout the movie because they are all treated like enemies or like total idiots. On the other side the Barbies are perfect entities. In a certain way it seemed ""Birds of Prey"" where the situation was exactly the same but in that case there weren't two of the biggest writer in Hollywood behind. Not to mention the totally worst thing that is how the Barbie solve the main conflict: instead of using intelligence they use seduction. This is so wrong because in a movie that wants to be empowering, women are depicted as better suited in seducing instead of thinking. All of these ruin other good ideas like for instance the inversion of the point of view that is useful to explain to men what women in our society has to live every day. That was pretty interesting but it gets lost between what mentioned before.In conclusion, I was very disappointed by the ""Barbie"" movie because I actually had high hopes knowing that it could have been a fun movie with positive messages, but it was the total opposite. I've seen it with both females and males and the reactions were generally mixed and no gender pattern was evidenced in terms of appreciating it or not. However the great merit that I have to give credit to the movie is that it triggers a discussion capable of actually enrich people through sharing of experiences. And so, even if I didn't like it I'd suggest you to watch ""Barbie"" and discuss of it with your families and friends!"
"When I sat down to watch this film I assumed it would be some fun pink silly movie but it was not in the best possible way. It starts very much in that way but the second Barbie gets to the real world everything changes and the film makes so many important statements on sexism and the treatment of women. I thought it perfectly addressed the affect Barbie has had on the world and never shied away from it. This movie does not flinch away from the reality of the world or what damage ignorance can do (Ken). America Ferrera's speech is amazing and moved me so much as did Barbie's own found freedom. Robbie was an amazing Barbie and all the women shined in this movie...and Alan was pretty good too. It was everything you can want from a movie, sharp, whitty, moving, honest and progressive. The perfect Barbie."
"Without consumerism, without belief, without plastic accessory and hope for a perfect day, where would Barbie find herself?And more importantly where would we find ourselves?In a plot that seems stitched together like an old pair of vintage jeans (that you just can't let go of), Greta Gerwig serves us a platter of modern satire and deep analysis of the condition that we find ourselves in today.Barbie is perfect. Until she's not. And she's becomes accustomed to our culture. The perspective of an otherwise perfect doll born from a matriarchy is wholly interesting and captivating as we laugh, hate and cry throughout the movie. Barbie must find out what is wrong with her owner but in doing so she discovers imperfect humanity and falls in love with it. This is the story and it is told brilliantly.There is no need to mention the phenomenal performances by each and every actor in this film. The set design, the costumes, the cinematography are all a testament to Greta Gerwigs skill as a director.To view this film as merely a feminist blockbuster is to ignore the fact that feminism is not just woman's problem but a humanity's problem. This is what the movie displays. Go into it with an open mind and you will see that it does not preach for women to rule men but for men and women to discover themselves without being pressured by the culture around them. A message which needs to be broadcast across the world in a time of such needless division.We are all forced to live like dolls in this world and we must escape from this and discover ourselves. It is amazing to see Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach tackle such daring themes and pull it off. The comedy throughout provided by celebrity cameos and hilarious satire is spot on.The soundtrack is astounding and in particular Billie Eilish's song ""What was I made for?"" is a fantastic close to the journey of discovery that Barbie and Ken have been through.A brilliant achievement in modern film making that makes me hopeful for the future as we tackle more and more complex issues head on - rather than watch boring old men debate uselessness on YouTube."
"""If you brought a 7 year old girl to see this movie she would neither have fun nor be happy at all""
And this was my girlfriend's statement as soon as we left the cinema.I see it as an ok movie, occasionally very entertaining but overall chaotic, a bit cliché and even boring at times.Solid 6/10, i've seen worse but pales in comparison to The Lego Movie and other ""nostalgic intellectual property movies"" such as Mario Bros, which can contain deep messages without ruining the whole thing as I feel Barbie did.I have to give credit to the numerous exhilarating scenes with the Kens and the CEO, stereotyping done right IMHO."
"I was be able to attend the pre premiere of this movie and I have to say this movie was unexpectetly good and this comes from a non Barbie fan. Barbie is the role Robbie was clearly born to play. Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu were incredible too and actually the whole cast of this movie shines ! Barbie is a brilliantly executed, incredibly fun, brightly colored, completely logical feminist statement that should be remembered come awards season. Ultimately, Barbie is so many things: a stereotype, a toy, an idea; a vessel of imagination; a cultural relic. But in Gerwig's trusted hands, this is Barbie like you've never seen her before."
"I had no idea what to expect going into Barbie. I had no interest in seeing a movie about Barbie but was immediately sold on the highly talented Margot Robbie and the awesome Ryan Gosling. But I was still nervous that the comedy would be aimed strictly at women and would be difficult for a guy to enjoy.To my surprise, I didn't feel that at all. This movie is hilarious. It's the kind of stupid-funny I love, the kind usually reserved for ""dude movies."" Something you're more likely to see in a Will Ferrell movie. I was not aware Ryan Gosling could be so funny.Even though the majority of the movie is silly and fun, Margot Robbie still gives a great performance, as usual. She continues to prove she's a star. And most of the supporting cast are welcomed additions.I found Barbie highly entertaining. I think most will enjoy it, except maybe guys who are sensitive to anything empowering women or making fun of men. That's not me. The parts that made me laugh the most are the jokes about the guys.(1 viewing, early fan screening UltraScreen 7/19/2023)"
"Unfortunately, most reviews that I've read here that score this film poorly explain so clearly that the reviewer did not understand the message of the film. It is not anti-men, it does not portray men as ""stupid"". Take a moment to think about how women have been portrayed in movies over the last century - oh yes, just as Ken is here! The movie exaggerates this, yes. That is the point. To clearly (and humourously) highlight the inequalities when the roles are reversed. Stop being offended by something that isn't offensive and take a bit of time to actually think about the film that you have watched.The film was fun, emotional, moving, sad and empowering in many ways. I must admit I hadn't expected to enjoy this film, but wow, what a surprise!"
"The story feels like watching modern animated barbie movies in this past decade. If you lower your expectations, you gonna kinda enjoy it. The first 30 minutes is good, but the last 30 minutes feel rushed.It's Enjoyable movie for Barbie fans out there, the visual look good. It's not a serious movie, the genre is comedy after all. Feel like watching SNL. The casts look having fun in this movie.But when they really want delivering the ""women's have power or something"" message, I can't really follow what they said when have long speech about it. I'm a woman, but even for me the way they delivering the message still feel forced. Just long speech can't catch audience attention.Anyway I'm still crying in the end of the movie, after all those silly scenes. Because Margot Robbie acting is so good. Showing how beautiful being alive.It's a fun Movie."
"Barbie is a really fun movie that all ages can enjoy because while it's colourful and entertaining the main storyline can get emotional at times. The comedy in the movie is pretty funny too and got a few laughs from everyone in the cinema, the music is really nice and so are the choreographed dances. What I liked the most about this movie is that it was very doll-like, the food and drink were plastic and fake, the cars didn't have engines and just glided along the floor, and the actors were doll-like in their movements and how they interacted with their environment.The sheer amount of details that are in this movie is amazing, from the clothes, the wide variety of dolls, cars, pets, houses, and even down to the accessories were a perfect match to what's being sold or what has been sold in the past. On another note, I was not expecting the plot twist and the antagonist to be revealed, but that's what I liked about this movie, I went in thinking to know what this movie was going to be about but I was wrong and was surprised. As the movie progresses you find yourself enjoying it more and more, it's well paced and it has a good story so I definitely recommend it!"
"This movie is specially for those who loves the character of barbie specially in childhood. This film is a treat for Barbie lovers because the way director has told the storyline by introducing a whole barbie world and their characters is interesting to watch. Specially MARGOT ROBBIE what and actress she is her looks, style, acting performances, dresses of barbie all are top notch. Margot Robbie is perfectly suited for this role because she is the only one carrying the whole movie throughout the end. From start to end the main highlight of the this film is Margot Robbie. I've only watched this film for her and she has proved that currently she is one of the best actress in Hollywood. When I talk about supporting cast RYAN GOSLING is the only one who has done justice to the character of Ken rest are just average. Story is the main disappointment of the film, Film starts on a good note with laughs and riot of chaos when Barbie enters into the real world but after a bit of time story get exaggerated and only focuses on the central character which is the drawback of the film and from that case movie doesn't get the chance to give space to the other important characters. Background score and songs are good that wil give you a fresh vibe while watching this film. All n all this movie is a treat for Barbie fans and rest of the audience may consider as an average content...."
"Why didn't I love 'Barbie'? I mean it's a brilliantly shot film. It's got a great Ryan Gosling, a very good Margot Robbie. Its heart is in the right place; its message is a good, politically correct, one. Its pacing is fine. Its not too long. So then, what was wrong?And the answer is (I guess) ... the story. The plot. While it's far from terrible it was also far from great. And - dare I say this? - it was at times confusing. Confusing in that I did not always understand the characters' motives. Why were these dolls thinking what they were thinking, or doing what they were doing? And yes I know we're talking about fantasy here, so we can't be, or shouldn't be, ascribing real human wants and desirers to these ... dolls. But the film's message is directed to humans, as played out through dolls, and so knowing the dolls wants and desires is not completely out of place.Because 'Barbie Dolls' are manufactured in different kinds of outfits (nurse, pilot, soldier) the film's Barbie-Land heroine, the 'Stereotypical Barbie' (Robbie), believes that real women are equally represented in / by human society. When she learns that is not the case, she travels to the 'real-world' to (a) learn more and (b) help out. What follows is a mish-mash of Barbie-Land male dolls (Gosling) awakening to the benefits of the macho life while its female dolls acquiesce to male demands. That is, until they are awakened by the return of Barbie and some real-world friends. And real-world women's rights lecturing.At least I think that was what was going on. I say that because while I watching the film it had nothing resembling this clarity. So I guess, consciously or otherwise, I thought about it afterward and came up with that theory.My way of saying (a) I could very well be wrong and (b) You might come up with an altogether different interpretation.And I guess that's the answer. Clarity or lack of. That's why I didn't love it."
"""Barbie"" is a comedy film based on the line of fashion dolls by Mattel. Directed and co-written by Greta Gerwig (""Lady Bird"", ""Little Women"") and starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, it takes every opportunity to revel in its amusing premise with a darkly satirical look at gender structure in society.In Barbieland, a matriarchal utopia where all women are successful, Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) lives a happy life spending time with her female friends and hanging out with her boyfriend Stereotypical Ken (Ryan Gosling). One night at a dance party, Stereotypical Barbie suddenly finds herself contemplating her own mortality and worries about what her future holds. The next day, Stereotypical Barbie discovers she is now unable to follow her usual routine, which results in her perfect skin breaking out in blemishes. After following advice from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), Stereotypical Barbie travels in her convertible to the real world to meet the child who plays with her, unaware that Stereotypical Ken has stowed away onboard.If you had to name a more iconic doll associated with little girls, I'm sure nearly everyone's first pick would be none other than Mattel's Barbie. Since first being launched back in 1959, Barbie has taken the world by storm, with the doll filling many different roles, including but not limited to a doctor, lawyer, astronaut, and even President of the United States. There have also been many movies made that star Barbie in leading roles, all of which have been CGI animated and released exclusively to video and streaming sites. Now adding to that catalogue, Greta Gerwig's live action cinematic feature titled simply ""Barbie"" is not only a fantastic send-up of gender roles but also a great comedy film in its own right that virtually everyone can enjoy regardless of age, gender, or political leaning.What could have been another generic film for parents to put on in the background to keep their young daughters quiet is actually one of the cleverest deconstructions of the world's view of the societal hierarchy since 2014's ""The LEGO Movie"". When we first see Barbieland, it is shown to be a bustling, exuberant paradise that is perfect for all of its inhabitants. That is, of course, only if you are a woman, and not one of the ""Kens"" where their enjoyment is based solely on being an accessory to the other ""Barbies"". It is obvious that this is a place where men cannot make a name for themselves, which sets in motion Stereotypical Ken's desire to travel with Stereotypical Barbie into the real world. Upon arriving, Ken learns that this new place is the mirror opposite of Barbieland, with real life society valuing patriarchy over matriarchy. In any normal instance, I would have rolled my eyes watching a movie allude to contentious political matters like this, but I quickly realised that the film is actually attacking both sides of the spectrum in the best way possible. In Barbieland, the matriarchy causes the women to exude toxic femininity towards men while in the real world we see the patriarchy make men show off their toxic masculinity towards women. Neither of these are glorified and where this film succeeds greatly is in the way it cleverly informs the audience that the extremes on both ends are what causes problems with society and that too much of either always leads to bad results.In addition to satirising gender norms, the film also functions as an amusing, gag-packed standalone comedy for casual viewers as well. There were a number of moments where I found myself laughing out loud at some of the jokes being made about the autonomous way Barbieland's populace live their lives. For instance, the Barbies are incapable of touching the ground with flat feet due to their default designs being made for high heel shoes. Also, the Kens are almost always seen at the beach awaiting instructions from the other Barbies, only for most of them to be ignored. However, some of the film's most hilarious parts occur when Barbie and Ken are in the real world, allowing for some humorous fish-out-of-water scenes involving their interactions with real people. There's even the occasional jab taken at Mattel themselves, parodying the commercialism surrounding Barbie and all her accessories. While not every single joke lands, there are so many of them that for every one that fails there are plenty of others that work just fine. In fact, without giving it away, this film has one of the funniest closing lines to a movie I've ever heard, so much so that it actually caught me off guard during my initial viewing.I also liked the practical production design of this movie, with minimal CG giving Barbieland a real toy-like aesthetic. As one might expect, the most prominently used colour here is pink. Nearly everything important in this world is pink - pink houses, pink beds, pink lamp posts, etc. Believe it or not, there was actually a worldwide shortage of pink paint due to the amount that was used to make this place look as authentically girly as possible. Later when Barbie and Ken are exploring the outside world, things look decidedly ordinary but since they are still wearing their brightly-coloured outfits, the two to stick out like a sore thumb from everybody else. It's rare for a film to effectively use its colour palette to evoke comedy so effectively and this one handles it in a way that all ages will understand it.As a Barbie girl living in her Barbie world, Margot Robbie is clearly having a great time portraying this stereotypical version of the iconic doll. The fact that there's nothing especially noteworthy about this specific Barbie means that she has the most room to grow as a character. Robbie's Barbie is friendly, fun-loving, but blissfully ignorant of what her boyfriend Ken truly wants with her. Though not outright malicious, she inadvertently makes Ken feel unwanted due to her conditioned attitude towards all the other Kens in her world. What I liked best about Robbie's performance was the way she shows an open-mindedness to the character. She is curious about what type of world lies beyond Barbieland and whether things will be the same or different to what she is used to. It would have been easy to have made this Barbie a man-hating blonde bimbo with no capacity for independent thought but rather she remains pleasant towards everyone and is willing to learn about new experiences on her journey.Whether intentional or not, I think Ryan Gosling's version of Ken steals the movie practically every time he is shown on screen. Maybe it's because I'm so used to seeing Gosling play stoic, subdued roles but watching him come to life as this version of Barbie's boyfriend was quite a surprise. Although this isn't the first comedic role Gosling has played, it is here that he effectively demonstrates all the humorous possibilities he is capable of as an actor. We watch Ken try to surf at the beach as a means to impress Barbie, only to realise he cannot ""swim"" in the placemat water. Later, he tries to apply for certain jobs in the real world based solely on his gender, but is told that he needs proper qualifications in order to be taken seriously by employers. There's just something about the way Gosling is able to showcase such loveable pathos as Ken that makes you want to see how he can become more than just the generic partner of his more famous girlfriend.From the perspective of a 30-something heterosexual man who has never once expressed interest in playing with dolls, the film ""Barbie"" pulls off the miraculous task of transcending above its stereotypical audience of young girls to appeal to all viewers instead. It offers an observant satire about the world's views on gender roles while also functioning as an amusing comedy film packed with jokes galore. No matter what your general opinion on Barbie may be, whether you love her as an entertaining toy or hate her because you don't care for what she represents, this movie has you covered on both fronts. In that regard, this film has done its job.I rate it a solid 9/10."
"Addresses current critical issues; basically, the movie revolves around that. The central ideas are patriarchy and female empowerment, which I believe were handled intelligently and elegantly. I was particularly surprised in this regard; I didn't expect the film to be so mature.I also want to highlight the makeup, set, photography and choreography. Top-notch, flawless.The context is also interesting; the script is creative, and the story is engaging, making the film much more fluid. Personally that's what I liked the most, how the fantasy and the reality interact. The actors were amazing too, and not only the main characters.Some other human characters were underdeveloped compared to Barbie and Ken, but that was expected.As a man I recon that this is a movie that speaks to women, but also to men sensible to women struggles. I went to watch it without expecting more than a visually beautiful film, and I left the cinema positively surprised."
"I was really surprised about how much i liked Ryan Gosling in this. I had totally forgot about his comedic talent and timing. The movie works. There is definitely a moral message in this, even though I believe the majority of viewers will be too distracted by Margot Robbie and Ryan Goslings great performances and all of the comedy elements in this and the fact that the script is hardly worth being filmed. I feel like with a different script they could have created something truly great.Over all it's a fun family movie to enjoy together. I watched this and afterwards Oppenheimer last night and I am truly glad I did it in that order, because I doubt that I would have been able to enjoy this even nearly as much if I had watched Oppenheimer first."
"So i've just got back from theaters and all i got to say is wow, that was such a fun, funny, charming movie and the Barbie world was just so colorful ! ( which we knew from the trailers )Now before you say
anything... no, this movie doesn't hate men, if anything it understands men's struggles just as much as women's, i was scared that the movie whould demonizes(?) Ken too much but he was really funny and you could see where he was coming from, with him always being in Barbie's shadows and all thatSpeaking of Barbie, Margot Robbie is the perfect Barbie, she was so perfect that now i have difficulties imagining anyone else as the role of a life action Barbie, and look, i'm not saying this is the best movie of the year but for now... it's the one i liked the most."
"I knew this was going to be political going in but I thought its Barbie so I could overlook it. But it was too much, I do not enjoy politics in movies, whether it's left or right. I expected it to be more fun, and feel good, and it was for some parts but not enough at all. Ryan was great and so was Margot but I did not understand why Barbie didn't like Ken, it's wildly known that Barbie loves Ken and Ken loves Barbie, it's iconic and it made no sense for everything else in Barbie land to be accurate but not that. Another problem was the writing it was very ""told and not shown"" as well as wordy. The scenery was great as well as the costumes, but the story could have been so much better. Like Barbie and Ken take L. A. on a fun adventure and some self-discovery but it wasn't really like that. The ending was confusing does Barbie want to have a baby?"
"I tend to gravitate towards French cinema and the classics; the idea of watching a franchise movie about Barbie seemed mildly repellent at first. Well, I am glad I kept an open mind.This is a riotously funny, zany meta comedy with touches of Wes Anderson and Bollywood; yet also strangely affecting. The idea of giving a plastic doll an existential crisis may seem gimmicky, yet it works. The cracks showing in the perfect façade of the perfect Barbie world are rendered through metaphors that hit the mark, full of a strange melancholia. I am usually put off by sentimentalisms: here, thankfully, they are kept at a bare minimum, even in the ending.Overall, I am astonished this film exists at all. I imagine the authors meeting with a slightly distracted Mattel executive, being given a gazillion of dollars with the vaguest of briefs, and running away with it, to make a film that would send any corporate committee into a tailspin -- I imagine a first projection with the producers fainting and having a heart attack -- yet also make them laugh all the way to the bank. However it happened, chapeau. I am glad I went, I'll buy the dvd as well. I can see myself rewatching it to be sure I got all the micro gags and layers of meaning, but also putting it on when I need a little pick me up."
"""Barbie"" is a movie that is setting all sorts of records, so it's obvious that the film is touching many people. For some, it's the fun of seeing a doll come to life, for others it's the theme of empowerment that make the movie a big hit. As for me, I did like it and thought it was a pretty good movie...but it's not for everyone.The first 2/3 of the film are simply fun and a visual delight. Seeing all the Barbie's in Barbieland was a joy. It also was very nice seeing Barbie enter the real world and interact with all the unfamiliar aspects of it. As for the final third, for me, this is what hurt the film a bit...at least for some viewers. Why? Well, I loved its message of female empowerment but I also felt it was delivered like a sledgehammer. Instead of talking about it and getting on with the plot, the movie bogged down for me and seemed to keep making the same point repeatedly. Subtle, it was not. On the other hand, who am I to complain...I did like the movie and am glad it had a nice feminist bent. Obviously this worked for many women seeing the film. Overall, a very good movie that slowed to a crawl towards the end. Not bad...but a film I wanted to like more than I actually did."
"A fun and clever enough comedy and twist on the world's most famous doll with wonderful production values, a charming Margot Robbie and an absolute hilarious Ryan Gosling.Ultimately, Barbie is so many things: a stereotype, a toy, an idea; a vessel of imagination; a cultural relic. But in Gerwig's trusted hands, this is Barbie like you've never seen her before.Cinematography is great here, Set pieces are outstanding and the Soundtrack is a masterpiece.I want to take a minute to take about Greta Gerwig she is so clever and talented hope this movie will push her to direct big blockbuster movies that she deserves."
"The first half was pretty enjoyable, fun, light, but it took itself too seriously by the second half. No longer allowing the talented cast, especially Gosling, to shine and make us laugh. It felt like the talents of Will Ferrell and Michael Cera were also somewhat underutilized. Interesting concept, had potential, but later in the movie, it definitely started to fall flat for me.Ryan Gosling definitely held this movie together for me, without the laughs he gave me, it would've definitely been lower than 6/10. I think there was just too much of a push to bring politics into the movie. Some is fine, but it enveloped the movie entirely by the end. Whether or not any of the political stuff was accurate, it felt forced and out of place."
"I wanted to love this movie but it just wasn't it :(It was nothing that hasn't been done before. It didn't really say anything. I hate using the word woke, but hearing the same talking points is tiring. We understand, the patriarchy is bad. But I didn't go to this movie to be preached to.I was hoping it would be a bit more camp. I was expecting it to be like the Barbie animated films you get, which ngl, are usually good. This was far from that.The ending was also a bit dragged out. It was trying very hard to be profound and it wasn't working.I didn't care for any of the characters much either and was a little sad to not see Raquelle or any of Barbie's sisters apart from Skipper.Apart from the criticism, I thought the costume design was really well executed. Margot Robbie looked fabulous at all times."
"Greta Gerwig's Barbie explores creation myths in Barbieland, a parallel universe populated by Mattel dolls. The director uses the toy conglomerate's vast archive and successful products as tools to create a rich and weird material. The movie is a clever send-up of Barbie dolls and their legacy, featuring light-hearted jokes that poke fun at Mattel, the doll's lore, and the contradictions of our sexist society. The director's storytelling is impressive, and the film's humor is both lighthearted and chuckle-worthy. Gerwig's Barbieland, created by Sarah Greenwood and Jacqueline Durran, is a pink fever dream with funky compositions by Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt, bubblegum anthems by Dua Lipa, Nicki Minaj, and Ice Spice. The film features plastic trees and identical two-story Barbie dream homes, with flying being the preferred mode of transportation. The production design and costuming are exceptional, showcasing Gerwig's passion for details and her ability to create a dreamlike world. Barbieland is a feminist utopia in which Barbies serve as presidents, Supreme Court members, doctors, physicists, Nobel prize winners, and cancer cures. The dolls are not structurally different from our world, but they are represented by political fantasy and decade-dependent what-ifs. Barbie has gone to space, could vote, and own property before many human women, and her appearance has changed to mirror society's beauty politics. The representational doll has become an extension of political fantasy, reflecting the beauty politics of society. Gerwig features a cast of Barbies, including Issa Rae, Emma Mackey, Alexandra Shipp, and Hari Nef. Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) is the protagonist, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed Barbie created by Ruth Handler. Her Ken counterpart, Ryan Gosling, is portrayed with humor and heart. They are a version of Eve and Adam, with their fall being dramatic. Barbie finds her perfect life hampered by existential thoughts and seeks answers from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a doll with a traumatic history. Stereotypical Barbie, with Ken, heads to real-world Los Angeles to find her little girl. The relationship between Barbies and their human owners is tenuously outlined, so it's best not to think too deeply about how it all works. Robbie's performance in Gerwig's Barbie highlights the tension between Barbie as an object and subject. Her expressive eyes and physical presence reveal the human world's forces, while her rigid presence in Barbieland suggests she's not less rigid in the real world. Despite the director's skill in capturing deeper themes, the film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest it ultimately serves a brand. The film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest the film serves as a brand. Gerwig's film Barbieland is a mix of fun and emotional depth, with a tension between keeping Barbie entertaining and blending her source material with previous projects. After a detour, Barbie returns home to find Ken's patriarchal knowledge has transformed Barbieland. The screenplay, by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, avoids familiarity and mockery, but the moments that aren't just funny are buried in important monologues, making the gestures feel politically hollow. The film's mandate is too ambitious, making it feel politically hollow."
"I am a MASSIVE and lifelong Barbie fanatic. I went in to this movie absolutely pumped. I came out of the movie blown away. Typical of Barbie, she blew me away with the absolute depth of her message. America Ferrera's monologue in Barbie Land had people clapping in the theatre. I appreciated it as a Mother, daughter, sister, wife and human being. The truth bombs she dropped got me right in the feels. I know. You are likely rolling your eyes and balking at the sheer IDEA that a BARBIE movie could be in any way profound. I say to you, you must not REALLY know Barbie then. This really was, if I think about it, in true Barbie fashion. Well done, my lady. Well done."
"The trailers and marketing for the movie were so good that I was really disappointed when the movie took an odd turn after 20-30 minutes into it.There could have been so many better turns than the one they took:
Barbie could have inspired the real world to be more Barbie-like (example: the movie Enchanted)Barbie could have spent her time in the real world helping the sad girlBarbie could have spent the whole rest of the movie in the real world figuring out who she wanted to beInstead it became an odd war between men and women, which in the end, ended with just as much inequality as there is in the real world but with women in power and men not even having any homes. I don't get why they went with that. The Barbie movie could have ended with equality."
"I am a man but watched this movie it's awesome Margot Robbie very beautiful but i like the performance of Ryan Gosling a lot this movie It's full of imagination and it surprises me a lot.Especially if anyone is a Barbie fan, let me tell you, this event is very satisfying.Even I'm not looking fun. And in the movie part, it's bad comedy and teasing yourself (Warner) quite a bit .. You have to go and see for yourself and you will definitely laugh.Ryan Gosling's acting is so good, I'm sure there's a lot of laughs out there during filming.This is another very good performance for this man.What the movie does is like imagination that doesn't have to care about logic. Let's just say the story is like we're playing with dolls and assuming the role of that character..."
"If forgotten, Ryan Gosling started off in the mickey mouse club. Important to remember because wow what a talented individual. Recent memory sees him leading roles that require a more stoic subdued approach, and it can be easy to miss his range. Barbie seeks to utilize all his acting muscles, and to a resounding success. He can sing, dance, act, and do comedy.It wouldn't be totally outrageous to suggest he is the star of the movie. Of course, he is one of the stars, but I would posit he is THE star of Barbie's movie.I was left wondering if the Ken story arc was the stronger theme of the film. Overall, I felt an absurdist philosophy underlined the film. There was a feminist message, sure, but it wasn't as nuanced as Ken's perspective on the patriarchy. At one point, Gosling's Ken quips ""When I found out patriarchy wasn't about horses, I lost interest.""Ken's attitude speaks to the idea that most likely the majority of men could care less about a patriarchy or how the world works. They're on the ride like everyone else and playing a role in the fantasy of getting a gal to look there way. In essence, the reality is Ken is only Ken in relation to Barbie being Barbie and the truth is everyone is an Allan."
"I'm not someone who often watches comedies, so they don't make me laugh much, but if they all became as funny as Barbie, I might give it another go.Because I really laughed out loud during the film.It did away perfectly with the comedy and the moralizing, a bit deeper, philosophical stuff.Of course, the soundtrack is top-notch, the sets are breathtaking and there's Ryan Gosling: the main reason I came.In addition to all that, this film is a good critic of patriarchal rule, without overdoing it. It questions gender roles in a fluid way, and brings existential questions to the fore.By the way, I don't understand the opinions of those who didn't like the film because it promoted feminism. Whereas Barbie is literally an invention designed to make women feel as important as men in society, to break down stereotypes and glorify gender equality.Ok whatever, go and see it, it's worth it."
"I'm a man in his 40's and I know I'm clearly not their target demographic. I went with my girlfriend and her two daughters and they enjoyed it.The sets were all very very well done. They put a lot of time into them. The acting was awful, but awful on purpose? I'm not sure. The plot was confusing at times. I wasn't sure what that big battle was for. Why were they fighting? No reason or lead up to it was there.I really enjoyed the scenes when they were in the real world. They did good with the 'fish out of water' thing. I laughed a couple times.The sexual innuendos were there and I thought they were funny but thankfully my girlfriends daughters did not understand them.I would say a 11-13 year old girl would enjoy this."
"When I first knew there was a Barbie movie in production, a live action, I thought ""It should be as bad as the others movies""...
When I notice was Greta Gerwig making the movie, my expectation get higher. Then, when I saw the cast, my expectations were even higher!I went to watch this movie in the premiere and I can assure you this movie is a masterpiece.It's purposely not realistic, has an excellent director and an excellent production and story.There are lots of fun moments, but this movie is a satire to the life of Barbie.The fact that compares the dream life of Barbie to the real life in the real world it's fantastic. It's a never seen thing. It compares the women's mistreatment, the real tragedy's... it's a real good idea...
Everything in this movie is really good. Go watch this movie. It deserves you attention."
"I feel... Confused? I guess?The old Barbies were part of my generation. I was skeptical but curious about the hype around that movie. Sooooo much advertisement everywhere that it made me nauseous.The movie starts and I'm like... This is gonna be long... And then it gets even longer and more and more political!I get it... They wanted to make a political movie about what women could be if we took down the patriarchy and the men can just be who they want to be with feelings and all.The execution is colorful and you feel the sarcasm in every choice the movie maker made.I would have given it a lower score but I gotta admire the research and execution.It seems I must have missed a lot of jokes because some people were laughing when I was not.What's up with having so many cast members of Sex Education?Also?! Was that Gosling singing?! He gotta sing more! However, why him as Ken? Don't get me wrong, I love the guy but he didn't really fit as sand blond Ken."
"While the production value, cinematography and acting were what you would expect from Margo Robbie and the supporting cast. I felt the movie fell short of not preaching to me and spreading a message of division rather than unity. Men and women cannot survive without each other but you'd never know it watching this movie. And me having my 13 year old daughter with me almost caused me to walk out of the theater. I kept on waiting for the writers to hit the direction of unity but it never came. After the movie my daughter brought up the message to me saying how she even noticed the weird agenda they're trying to push and said that is not a movie for the easily impressionable. Come to find out my daughter is better suited to take on the world that I thought she was. Proud day for me as a father."
"This movie, wow. Just wow. This was unlike anything I had expected going in to seeing Barbie earlier today. I figured by the trailers alone it was going to be a fun popcorn movie filled with adventure and eventual romance between Barbie and Ken with it ending with them getting together, beating bad guys when crossing into our world and living happily ever afterBoy was I wrong. Holy moly, Barbie hits deep and can be thought provoking, at least to me it was deep and thought provoking. I mean seriously, this isnt a typical fun popcorn movie. Yes it is still fun and pretty damn hilarious at times. But the themes it was showing throughout the story with it being the following - self identity, discovering who you are as a person and want to do in life. It is ok to be imperfect, to be weird, kooky, dark, it's ok to not live up to anyone's expectations in life or those around you. Just be you and only you. Self love. Willing to accept change even if you dont like it. There's also this indepth battle between patriarchy vs matriarchy with some feminism thrown into the mixIt's funny, heartwarming, filled with unexpected surprises and Im sure for all the hardcore Barbie fans who collect the dolls and merch it has all the easter eggs and classic accessible shown through this brilliant movieMargot Robbie and Ryan Gosling did an exceptional job as Barbie and Ken giving us pretty complex and deep characters with them both growing and developing over time. Ryan Gosling as Ken especially is definitely one of the main highlights of the movie as you can tell he had fun in the role as Ken."
"My wife and I were two of the apparently 200,000 or so people who Barbenheimered Greta Gerwig's and Chritopher Nolan's hot topic movies on opening weekend. ""Oppenheimer"" was first, a boring slog of history in which a bunch of white men blathering at each other for three hours resulted in the creation of weapons that could wipe out humanity. ""Barbie"" came in the evening, a fresh breeze of humanity to clear away Nolan's emotional constipation.Yet predictably, people are losing their marbles over the ""man hating"" of Barbie and claiming that its brand of feminism is going to be the end of all of us. Ummm.....did you not watch the movie playing next door, the one about the invention of the atomic bomb? But oh my god, there are women suggesting that they should be treated as human beings! What's to become of us all?Oh well, at this rate climate change is going to wipe us all out before either nuclear weapons or feminism, so if you can only see one of these two movies with your remaining time on planet Earth, I would recommend this one. It's a bit scattershot and messy, but it does have a bold vision, and give me a bold vision that doesn't always work over a bland safe movie any day. ""Barbie"" isn't man hating, unless you think anything that suggests women haven't been treated well by a male-dominated society is man hating, in which case you're close minded and there's no point talking to you. It's just arguing that there are a whole different set of rules for women than for men, and they're crafted to frequently put women in a lose/lose situation, whereas everything is set up to benefit men, because men invented the system in the first place. Why can't we tweak the rules so that everyone's positioned for success?Margot Robbie is winning as Barbie, but this film's MVPs are Ryan Gosling and the production design.Grade: A-"
"Barbie is a fun summery movie for all ages.It tells the story of the doll Barbie who has to go into the real world to find her girl owner after she starts behaving oddly for a Barbie doll. That is the main prompt of the movie, which quickly takes a new turn all together, focusing on Ken and turning the tables on gender and how men and women are presented in films and in art in general (not to mention how their are treated in real world). That social commentary was spot on, under the light of more comical lences that makes it more appetizing and easily digestable. However, the movie does get close to being over preachy, loosing its initial main idea. That could have been solved by making the movie a little longer, giving the plot space to smoothly develop and have all those features handled in a better way. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't have that, thus, the result is an overstuffy, half baked plot.On the other hand, the performances were enjoyable, with Gosling trully shining in this one. The mood and costumes were also spot on."
"Only Greta Gerwig can pull this movie off. She is the only one that can helm this movie right. No other directors can do what she did for this movie. Why? Because the others would end up making this movie as generic or as plain as possible aka 'just another commercial blockbuster movie'. Greta Gerwig was able to turn the wheels from the overly used direction, venturing into new territories most directors are afraid to go.Barbie the Movie sends out strong messages and contexts about a lot of different things. Some of them include patriarchy, male-dominated world, female-dominated world, perfectionism, teenage-phase life, adulting, gender equality, equity, sexual objectifications amongst many others. Now, you must be shocked to hear all of this are conveyed in this film. A Barbie film that talks about all this stuff? YES. This is Greta's X-Factor, having to bring these sensitive subjects into a movie for everyone catered for all audiences. And children will still be entertained and understood with the story and the messages that Barbie brings to the table.It is definitely not an easy job trying to recreate the world of Barbie and make it a reality. Life in plastic, the team has to build Barbie Land from scratch. Everything needs to look right; the environment, the designs and the outfits. And Greta and the team did their research and you can clearly see it from the movie. Everything just comes to life the way they are supposed to be. Everything is plastic and yet, it's gorgeously constructed. The atmosphere, mood and tone really give that Barbie Land vibes.You need to acknowledge that this is a very meta movie. While Warner Bros failed at doing this with The Matrix: Resurrections, Barbie the Movie is a whole different story. They did this justice! It is self-aware that this film is about toys, that toys are not living objects, that someone else is controlling the narrative and they use this opportunity to create a story around this meta-themed element and it works! It works so well because the film is carefully constructed and impeccably paced, knowing what to serve the audience, when to be self-aware and how to blend Barbie's storyline with all the meta together, making the film as a stand out compared to other similar themed features.Barbie the Movie, which prior to viewing, we thought that it was going all in for women empowerment. But it didn't. Instead, it's full with surprises that started off thinking it was going to be that but as the film progressed, it opened up to so many possibilities of perspectives and viewpoints because the story itself is not definite but subjective and timely. It touches on current issues that are important not only for women, but for men as well. It doesn't want to side with a certain group for people, what it wants is to get the message acroos right; to make sure that everyone gets the story they deserve.While the story unwraps, there are golden comedy moments of pop-culture references and sarcastic remarks that, if you knew what they're about, you'll be laughing because of how relatable it is with today's world or personal experiences OR because of you didn't expect that a film like this would have jokes so sarcastic. If you've ever played with any dolls or toys, if you always keep up with the news and if you truly understand what meta is, you'll get all the references.We had hoped when Ryan Gosling was casted as the main Ken. Well, we knew he was the perfect choice, to put it fair and square. His performance was good but because Margot Robbie was so freaking excellent and top-notch as the main Barbie, Gosling couldn't put his character on par with her, he overacted at times and the makeup department tried making him look young but the powder they put him on actually made him look the total opposite. If you'd asked, Glen Powell would have been a better choice as the stereotypical Ken. He suits as a blondie, originated from Texas, his six-pack is crunched as seen in Top Gun Maverick and he has great comedic timing, evidently from Scream Queens.Did at any time the message comes across as preachy? Holistically, no. But they did slip a bit somewhere at the end of 2nd act (middle) up until the beginning of 3rd act (finale) where it went a bit overboard. It became a bit 'on your face' and these scenes may be the reason that social media will explode with controversial discussions and arguments because of some viewers who feel threatened by the way the subjects are brought to the spotlight. We're all okay with this film but this bump they have makes it uneven from the remaining duration, in which everything is told very, very well.Almost everything with Barbie the Movie is great, even the tiniest elements. The colour palette plays a huge part in this movie, the dialogues know how to be impactful, the music is ear-soothing and the extras are just as important as the supporting, everyone actually plays a part in maintaining the mood of the film.Verdict: Filled with contexts and messages as rich as Oscar-nominated films, Barbie the Movie is a whole different game as it is full with surprises and hard-hitting truths about the world we live in today. It is self-aware of what it is and Greta Gerwig daringly takes charge of crafting a masterpiece storytelling that capitalizes on the heavy subjects without downgrading anything or anyone, maintaining both its quality and substance the entire film. You'll appreciate this 'life in plastic' film more than you can ever imagine. 💗"
"A good laugh of a film poking fun at Mattel, complicating the concept of Barbie while at the same time highligting the patriarchy and it's inherent incompatibility with human emancipation.The irony is that the fillmmakers at the same time found it necessary to depict men in a insanely sterotypical fashion. One might argue this is not the case since it is mostly Ken's that are depicted this way. But since the Ken's behaviour are supposed to reflect the human female's experiences of men in general, that argument falls flat.In Short, enjoyable film, but as a discussion on the shortcomings of our present patriarchal society it is disappointing."
"Barbie is a delightful and creatively refreshing comedy that breathes new life into the iconic doll's world. From the moment the film began, I was captivated by its smart and subversive storytelling, which cleverly blends meta-humour with a dash of eccentricity.The production design is a standout feature, a visually dazzling and wonderfully pink-themed universe. Margot Robbie's portrayal of Barbie is nothing short of impressive, skilfully capturing both the character's earnestness and humour. Her performance, combined with Greta Gerwig's skilful directing, makes for a truly entertaining and memorable experience.Throughout the film, I found myself chuckling at the witty humour and enjoying the unexpectedly bold take on what Barbie represents. The movie strikes a fine balance between honouring the iconic brand and playfully challenging its conventions, resulting in a unique and rewarding cinematic experience.While the film's intentions are commendable, there were moments when it felt like the themes could have been explored more deeply, leaving me slightly wanting more. Nonetheless, Barbie remains a fun and enjoyable ride, filled with charm and charismatic performances that made it stand out as one of the year's best comedies so far.In the end, Barbie proves to be much more than just a marketing gimmick, showcasing a refreshing take on a beloved cultural icon and making it a must-see for anyone seeking a smart, humorous, and visually arresting cinematic adventure."
"I found the movie to be refreshing, but it's far from perfect.Ryan Gosling's performance was the best thing about the movie. His sequences were the most memorable for me, which is something I never expected myself to say. His character, Ken, also happened to be well written.On the other hand, Barbie was a disappointing character. Margot Robbie was good enough. Even though there was nothing special about her performance, she wasn't the problem. It's just her arc was weakly written. The motivations used to drive the story forward were fragile and questionable. Her development at the end did not make sense. She wanted to become a human yet she only experienced the real world for like a few hours, during which she didn't go through any challenges or experiences to reach such conclusion in the end. She didn't even save the day; her owner did. It felt like Barbie was a supporting character in her own movie.Ken stole the show for the most part. Also, the song ""I'm just Ken"" should be nominated for the academy's ""Best Original Song"" award. It's just very catchy and the transitions in the song are very creative.The story overall could have been better."
"Barbie is simply a mind-blowing experience, and in a truly fine way! I was taken aback with the 2001 opening, since I have a personal aversion to seeing toys get destroyed, but then it starts to unfold.And what we have is a combination of The Twilight Zone and 1971's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.It really focuses in on one Barbie (Margot Robbie) who finds herself out of her element, and her struggle to comes to terms with herself. Though the film has some weirdness to it, it sets us up for the second half of the film which really shines.And its messages pack a wallop!!!The casting is top notch, starting with Ms. Robbie in the title role. Ryan Gosling also delivers a fantastic performance as well, with a wide range. But one actress truly deserves a Best Supporting Actress Oscar, and that is America Ferrara. The other performers are likewise great!I'm also struck by how Mattel allowed itself to be show in a fantasy way that isn't always flattering. And toward the end, we have the Barbie doll's creator, Ruth Handler (Rhea Perlman) tell Ms. Robbie's character some facts about herself that are less than flattering. That scene alone is incredibly powerful.And of course, the visuals are something to behold!On the whole, a truly incredible film that has a lot of originality! Highly recommended!"
"Dont fall for the 5 star reviews. This movie is extremely boring and goes on without a purpose even if it has it's hard to understand.Good humour but when they don't have anything to say they sing songs. Basically a musical movie, reminds me of High School Musical.Margot Robbie is amzing but Ryan Gosling steals the show not with his looks but his acting. He's the one who was gripping the movie. You will get to know about lot of Barbie you didnt know about.There will be moments where you'll be like whats going on? Why am i here ? Why didn't i book the tickets for oppenheimer early but this too shall pass."
"This film had the potential to become a cult classic with its strong cast, stunning costumes, and iconic character. However, it failed to live up to expectations, falling flat just like *spoiler Barbie's heels.The script initially captured the essence of little girls playing with their Barbie dolls, evoking a sense of nostalgia. Barbie dolls were once seen as limitless in their potential, inspiring young girls to explore various careers and fields, including STEM-based jobs. She helped promote young girls interest in science, engineering, math, and technology to hopefully bridge gender gaps in these fields. Barbie encouraged girls to dream big, fostered a love for learning and promoted self-confidence.Barbie symbolizes beauty and fashion-forwardness, allowing young girls to express themselves and embrace their individuality through styling their dolls. Playing with Barbies also promoted emotional intelligence, empathy, creativity, and problem-solving as girls created their own storylines and engaged in role-playing.Regrettably, this movie seemed to disregard the sentimental value associated with the traditional Barbie doll. Instead of embracing themes of friendship, teamwork, feminism, and self-discovery, the film failed to deliver. The friendships between the Barbie characters felt superficial, lacking depth. Rather than promoting equality and dismantling the patriarchy, the movie shifted to a full blown matriarchal focus, missing an opportunity to advocate for gender equality and alliances. There's a monologue by America Ferrera's character that just feels like a very negative view point on being a woman today. I thought it would start that way then maybe turn back toward how beautiful it is to be a woman... but it never did.In the spirit of equality, I also had high hopes this film would promote Barbie and not just a girls toy, but a great toy for any kid (girl or boy). It didn't go there at all.One aspect that felt problematic was the portrayal of Barbie and Ken's relationship, which verged on being toxic. It was evident that Barbie did not reciprocate Ken's feelings, creating an uncomfortable dynamic. The movie missed an opportunity to address this issue and explore the importance of open communication and respecting others' feelings. Ken, was extremely co-dependent and Barbie just saw him as an accessory. Yet when the tables were turned she didn't really learn anything from that.In terms of humor, the movie fell short of expectations. Most of the funny lines that appeared in the trailer seemed to be the highlights, leaving the rest of the film lacking in comedic impact. Additionally, the Ken dolls singing and fighting montage felt out of place, adding nothing substantial to the plotline. It came across as awkward and disconnected, failing to contribute meaningfully to the story.Overall, the film missed opportunities to address important relationship dynamics and deliver consistent humor, leaving these aspects underdeveloped and unsatisfying for the viewers.Additionally, Barbie's journey of self-discovery felt underwhelming, culminating in an anticlimactic ending at the gynecologist's office. It would have been more impactful if her desire to become human stemmed from her longing to share the qualities that Barbie stands for with the real world: friendship, kindness, perseverance, self-expression, and imagination. Sure she's 'ordinary real-world' Barbie but that doesn't mean she can't have extraordinarily character. The story just seemed to glaze over the opportunity to drive home a real lesson for the audience.Overall, I had really high expectations and this movie fell short in my book."
"I'm not one of those people who feel the need to apologize for watching 'Barbie'. In my opinion there are no bad movie genres, there are only good movies and bad movies. And the cinema is also popular entertainment, and buying a big bowl of popcorn and sitting in the air-conditioned theater to watch a musical comedy that features some of the most talented actors of the moment can't be the worst thing on a hot summer day. 'Barbie', Greta Gerwig's film did not make me regret the decision to watch it for at least three quarters of its duration.Barbie lives in an ideal world called Barbieland. Actually, I should use the plural, but I don't really know how, because it's not just about the blonde doll we all know, but about all the incarnations she has received over the decades - blondes and brunettes, with white, yellow, black or other skin colors, thinner or bigger. The multiple Barbies have the most diverse professions, from doctor to Nobel laureate writer, from astronaut to president of the United States. Ultimately, the Barbie universe was imagined to give courage and self-confidence to little girls and instill in them the idea that anything is possible. There are also boys, they are generally called Ken, but their purpose is to be the Barbies' (asexual) partners when those are willing to pay attention to them. The introduction to the film is excellent, with a quote from Kubrick's 'A Space Odyssey' and voiceovers narrated by Helen Mirren. When stereotypical blonde Barbie starts getting into trouble, the source is in the real world. Barbie must face reality and the conflict between universes is inevitable. The real world is not like the ideal world and the mixture of them will cause a revolution in Barbieland that will not necessarily be in the right direction. The awakening to reality or, if you will, the humanization of Barbie comes at a price.'Barbie' - the movie works well most of the time, especially when the focus is on the comedic and musical side and the message is integrated into the entertainment. The production is excellent. The sets, the costumes, the cinematography will surely receive Academy Awards nominations, and in some categories 'Barbie' may be the winner. The soundtrack reminds at some points fragments from the history of the pop and ballad genres of the 70s and 80s. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are excellent in the lead roles and I wouldn't be surprised if Barbie dolls borrow their faces (if they haven't already). The messages are well-punched and come across the screen quite well - genuine and fake feminism and the way Barbie products reflect society's conception of the place, role and appearance of women, the more or less camouflaged misogyny of contemporary society, corporations with their seemingly socially aligned messages camouflaging capitalist greed. All of this is well dosed and combined with what happens on screen until the final part of the film, when either the writers took themselves a little too seriously, or they did not have enough inspiration and instead of continuing to infuse the dissolved messages into entertainment they resorted to rhetoric and created an ending that I found forced and didactic. 'Barbie' was worth seeing for the fun part, for the colours, music and humour. When playing with dolls it is good not to be overly serious."
"There is first in every thing.And there's the first on a new thing.Greta Gerwig has never disappointed me. Even when she was at her point with the mumblecore genre. Now she bring her class and weirdness to a new top level.With Barbie Greta make the viewers never distracted but confused, in such a glam and fun colorful wave.Greta has done perfectly the accuracy and portrayal of certain dolls and places in Barbie's fabulous and magic world. Additionally, the pacing and storytelling choices feeling that it may bring directly in your cinemas the wonderful, fun, witty and very magic world that is the one of Barbie."
"The Barbie movie is a very mixed bag. It tries to appeal to both young girls and adults it seems, but this leads it to be very inconsistent with its humor. Margot Robbie does a fantastic job as Barbie and especially the opening works really well in highlighting the absurdity of Barbie's world, where its houses are all open and have no stairs, and its showers have no water and the fridge is filled with a drawing of groceries. All that works fantastic. But mixed into this is a lot of adult humor and sexual innuendo, which makes for a strange mix. It isn't until after the first act, where the movie tries to be more than just a movie about toys, that it kind of falls apart.The Barbie movie has a lot to say about gender rolls, and that is probably a healthy thing for the audience (even men) to think about. But if you are a male viewer, and if all you took from this movie is that ""it hates men"", then you completely missed the point. The movie critiques the role of men and women in society and it also critiques Barbie dolls and their depiction of what a girl should be. It pokes fun at it, while never completely turning against Barbie as a product. This is a Barbie movie after all. That this toy movie tries to be more than what one might expect out of such a film, is a good thing, including criticizing gender stereotypes. But the execution leaves more to be desired.There is plenty to critique about the Barbie movie that is valid. The Barbie movie tries to do a lot of things, and especially towards the third act it becomes kind of a mess. The movie could have benefited from a bit more focus. Instead, it is all over the place.Just the plot of Barbie and Ken being confronted with the real world, probably would have been enough for a whole movie. But to the movie's credit, it wants to be more than what the audience expects out of a Barbie movie. I would argue, too much.There's the plot of Mattel trying to capture Barbie, with the awkwardness of a Mattel product (what this movie is) critiquing Mattel. It never feels entirely earnest.Then there's the plot of Barbie seeking out the child she belongs to and reconnecting with her. This plot works the best, but it is kind of undermined by everything else that is going on.Then there's the side plot of Barbie meeting her creator, which at first feels like a random easter egg, but then later is brought back again towards the end of the movie, without really fitting in with all the other plots. The Barbie movie is very inconsistent regarding which world is magical and which is not. At first it seems as if Barbie-land is the place that is magical and unrealistic, which during the opening is the source of a lot of humor. Once Barbie and Ken visit the real world, the contrast leads to more humor. But then they start mixing in magical elements in the real world, and things become very messy. Such as Mattel having a mysterious floor where Barbie's deceased creator is still alive. This is later explained away as a haunting with a throw away line, but that doesn't quite explain it either. The movie seems to forget which of the two was the magical world and this ends up undermining the world building. It was a side plot we didn't need in the first place.Then there is the plot of Ken realizing men rule the world and learning traditional male stereotypes, and then bringing all that back to Barbie-land. This plot feels a bit disjointed. It ends up dragging the third act back to Barbie-land, when it feels all that belongs to stay in the first act. Everything with Barbie trying to make the other Barbies remember who they are, and revisiting ugly Barbie, should have been cut. It feels like a whole extra movie tacked onto a movie that already has plenty going on.All in all, it is a bit of a mess storywise. This script could have used a bit more editing. Also, it ends on a joke about Barbie looking forward to her first visit to a gynaecologist, which is a bit of low hanging fruit. When you try so hard to make a movie that has something to say about gender rolls, this is probably not the line should end on. Suddenly the story about a deleted elaborate farting scene makes a lot more sense.As a comedy movie, you can't aim for a high bar story wise, when your movie's comedy is aiming for the lowest bar. It doesn't seem to work."
"Never have I ever experienced this much fun during a movie. Every actor played its part perfectly. With enough self-awerness, humour and silly moments this was everything I hoped for. The budget was also insane, I can't wait to rewatch this so I can look at all the details again. The way Barbie moves, walks, drinks, acts?? Perfection.Also surprisingly emotional, I didn't expect to cry during a movie about a doll. But well wel well, it happened.Anyway, it deserves all the hype. Margot Robbie IS Barbie, there is nobody who could've done the role justice like her.And Ryan? Well, he's just Ken."
"For me, Barbie came very, very close to an 8/10 rating. The only reason it didn't quite get there was that it contains a few scenes that are too long and a bit too weak.On the plus side, there are several more things to mention. First and foremost, Barbie has attracted a very strong cast, with well respected names also in several supporting roles, and they all perform well. Margot Robbie was almost an obvious casting choice. With her skills and her appearance, she really IS Barbie (with a brain) for almost two hours.Director Greta Gerwig and her crew created perfect Barbieland sets, which made me smile in spite of the fact that I never owned a Barbie doll myself.The film had me laughing many times, and it also brought me to tears a few times. Quite impressive for a movie about a doll, I thought.And, last but not least, the message of the movie. Already when I heard that Greta Gerwig was going to make a Barbie movie, I knew we were in for a culture clash. The fact that she went all-in was not surprising to me, but that she managed to convince Mattel to go along with her was. Kudos not only to Greta Gerwig for that, but also to Mattel. This may turn out to prove enormously profitable for them in the end, and they undoubtedly hope to make Barbie relevant for a few more generations. Nevertheless, this took guts on their part. Well played."
"I absolutely loved the barbie movie, the movie had such a beautiful message and Margot is just exceptional.The world is so colourful , the characters are all fantastic.A great film for any barbie fan.Kate McKinnon and America Ferrera are stand outs as well.There will be people who cast judgment for the sake of being negative but I truly, genuinely think that most will enjoy this film.The full cast of the film are just perfect.Go check them it out, take your friends and make a night of it , can guarantee you will absolutely enjoy yourself.Will definitely see it again and can't wait for the DVD. Hope there is a stack of special features."
"Here's the thing.In my eyes BARBIE happens at the beginning of the movie. Amazingly created world with great looks and surprises now and then. Lovely! But then it feels like all about BARBIE is forgotten within seconds except for the pink color of course. The movie turns into a quite weird direction with happenings that are very sought and often don't make any sense at all. Suddenly everyone can jump around between two worlds and no one thinks that's crazy actually.Suddenly the difference between Kens, Barbies and Human beings is gone away ALTHOUGH in the beginning it shows definite differences like feet or fingers that aren't separate. Later on Ken plays the guitar and can move every single finger for example. All in all the great love for detail from the beginning is gone quite fast and turns into a long childish and boring battle between manly men and fimaly females. It starts to look like the TV-show Love Island. A loud unnecessary back and forth between genders. At the end a try of a deep scene to let go a few deep words and that's it. The movie teaches nothing to take home with. It's more like the name BARBIE was abused for this one in my eyes."
"Barbie is no longer just a toy; rather, this idea of 'Barbie' has evolved into one of the most famous and significant topics in the world at this moment in time. It is so much more than merely a toy. It will not longer be just 'a toy'I must admit, as i waited in the theatre for the movie to start showing, i had my doubts. So many things scanned through my head: one was that this movie will just be a lighthearted comedy; another was that the marketing for this movie is way too extravagant for a 'comedy'; and one of the biggest was that i would lose interest in this movie soon because i tend to lose track of comedies as it is really difficult for comedy films to impress me. Boy, was I wrong.Where do I start:To start off with, this is NOT just a comedy movie. Would everyone in the theatre have been in tears by the time the movie ended if it had been a simple comedy?This movie is appealing to spectators of varying ages because of its heartwarming plot, a plot that touches everyone's heart, a topic that is heavy in nature but simple in the showcasing of this topic throughout the movie.Barbie focuses on the story of Stereotypical Barbie & Ken... Barbie starts to experience strange thoughts and strange symptoms which causes her to travel to the real world with Ken to find the child who is playing with her doll and to fix the issue. When reading this plot, it is easy to imagine that this is just a comedy, action, simple film etc. However, this is only the PLOT... the storyline is very different.The opening scene itself focuses on a rather heavy topic of childhood, stereotypes, a new generation etc. With Barbie (Margot Robbie) appearing and the one of the little girls smashing her dolls to pieces, this was a very symbolic gesture to add right at the beginning of the film. It is is symbolic in the sense that, the young girl smashing her dolls represents a new generation in which dolls are not played with, it may also represent girls smashing or declining 'their dreams' due to female stereotypes (a topic that is heavy in this film) - I liked that Gerwig made it clear in the first 10 seconds of the movie that this film is not one to be taken lightly.Good comedic scenes are present throughout the film. Such as the jokes about Alan... however, even though Alan being on his own and not many people caring about Alan are seen as 'comedy' - I feel that there is much more behind Alan, and that making his scenes comedic are just a barrier, and that Gerwig wants spectators to take apart these scenes and to analyse what is behind that wall. That being Alan may represent 'women' in the sense that in this male-dominant world, women are constantly feeling pressured and alone, and not listened to.I like how Gerwig didn't make a whole 'new' concept of Barbie... this added to the topic of childhood and simplicity. I particularly liked how when Barbie floats from the top of her dream house to her car, this was symbolic as when young children play with Barbies, that is how they get their Barbie doll down too, they bring the barbie down as if it is floating, I really liked this detail, had innocence to it.Further on in the movie, the topics start to get heavier: For example when Barbie meets Sasha. Sasha described first world problems such as feminism, here Gerwig had SUDDENLY brought in these topics, without warning. Again, I liked this because it shows how suddenly this world makes decisions regarding women's rights, and how quick this world is to judge women.Ken's storyline was also an intricate part of the movie, the 2nd half of the movie is solely based on Ken wanting to not just be Ken and Barbie, but wanting to feel important. In the end, Ken realises that he is important too. Gerwig does this really well.... Although this movie highlights topics relating to women's rights, the end juxtaposes that in a sense and just shows that everyone is equal, and that was a nice message to finish the film off.The ending montage of childhood, barbies, children etc was a really heart-wrenching moment, a great way to end the movie... Gerwig played with emotions here, spectators started off the movie laughing, and ended in crying. Great way to showcase opposing topics.All in all, fantastic movie."
"So I headed to the cinema to watch Barbie, the new live-action adaptation of the beloved doll franchise. I had high hopes. Unfortunately, it fell short. Barbie takes us on a journey, with Margot Robbie portraying ""Stereotypical"" Barbie as she leaves her world of Barbieland and enters the Real World. She encounters friends, overcomes challenges, and discovers important lessons about herself and others. Barbie doesn't always hit the mark while attempting to blend comedy, drama and fantasy elements. The plot feels predictable and filled with clichés, and the theme and tone are sometimes inconsistent and confusing. The acting and characters come across as stereotypes (something expected in Barbieland but not in the Real World).Nevertheless, Greta Gerwig's direction is skilful and imaginative; Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt's music is catchy and uplifting; Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is vibrant with a burst of colours. The movie also incorporates intriguing symbolism and production design by contrasting Barbie's sparkly world with the realism of the Real World. The animation breathes life into Barbie's world on screen. Amidst it all are some moments accompanied by clever dialogue-particularly from Ken (played by Ryan Gosling), who, as you would expect, serves as Barbie's trusty sidekick, desperately wanting to be noticed and appreciated by Barbie.I had some issues with the movie because it only scratched the surface when exploring its themes. Throughout the story, Barbie touched on topics like death, unattainable perfection, gender roles, body image and self-esteem. However, it merely skimmed over these issues superficially, like snacking on junk food instead of having a substantial meal.Barbie isn't a masterpiece. It's not a disaster, either. It's an entertaining film for kids and adults. The movie attempts to convey a message about embracing oneself and accepting others. It doesn't do so convincingly or in an original way. It left me feeling amused and bored.Cute but shallow."
"My wife and I did the double feature of Barbie and Oppenheimer. Barbie started off strong and Ryan Gosling is very funny in the movie. The problem is none of the Barbies are in a comedy. This movie should have been 90 minutes of comedy. It maybe could have had a simple heartfelt moment between a mom and her daughter but this movie has several preachy moments that made me wonder, who is this movie for? Little girls won't enjoy this, teenage girls won't enjoy this, adult women won't enjoy this. So who is the target audience? Who are the preachy moments for? If you are thinking of watching something this month, choose Sound of Freedom or Mission Impossible."
"My mother was the only person I could convince to go watch Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" (2023) with me, and ""wow"" am I glad we went. It's been a while since I've seen such a genuinely fun and creative movie. Originality is what the world has been longing for!The story is clever and manages to be remain lightheaded and witty, while also conveying influential messages for- and challenging the audience with questions about modern feminism and discovering who you really want to be, no matter who you are.This film is colorful and 'alive', making it a joy to view upon. The set pieces, especially in Barbieland, are brilliant- and it truly makes me want to know if they actually built out a real-life Barbieland set. Did they?!The acting was brilliant from everyone; you could tell they were all having a lot of enjoyment on set. Margot Robbie carried this film for sure, as one can come to expect from this modern superstar. It was also enlightening to see Ryan Gosling take on such a comical role while also bringing a lot of depth to the character. He has a great sense of comedic timing and humor. From what I've seen in interviews, Ryan is basically embracing his comedic genius and I love it.I usually despise singing and dancing in movies, but in this film it put a smile on my face. Not just because it was amusing to watch, but because these people can actually perform really well on these fronts. It goes without saying that the music for this film was on point as well.I highly recommend everyone to go see this film, though maybe don't watch it directly before or after ""Oppenheimer"" in case you're following the current trend. Let both films sink in for a bit because they each deserve the attention."
"Even though I never played with Barbie myself, when word came out of a Barbie movie being released, I knew I had to watch it!.With Barbie being a worldwide icon, a cast like this movie and a soundtrack like that, I still had my doubts this was going to be any good. I went to the cinema with an open mind and in the back of my head with the idea that I knew this might not be it for me.Overall the movie is packed with some great humor and a beautiful underlying story about who Barbie really is. If you look at the cast you'll see that all the women that portray Barbie are also called Barbie, but this movie, as well as the dolls in real life show that a Barbie can be anything. Even though our main Barbie played by the magnificent Margot Robbie was the ''stereotypical Barbie'' and I did like some of the more versatile characters, I still think they could have done better than having one bigger Barbie and one in a wheelchair.I admit that 9 is a high rating but after leaving the movie theatre 24 hours later and stil stuck with the lyrics of Ryan Gosling singing ''I'm just Ken'', I can't help but to give a solid 9.Although this movie in any other context might be ''forgettable'', it is still a Barbie movie and it was just good fun. The humor was good, the cast was great and the soundtrack might be one of the strongest things about the movie. The outfits, especially worn by Margot Robbie were stunning.This movie is not going to be for everyone. It was very fake, theatrical and very ''Barbie (of course). I still loved every part of it even though I never played with Barbie or even seen any Barbie movie before this."
"Barbie is a thoughtful homage to an iconic toy brand that overturns the well known stereotype of the blonde, plastic ""bimbo"". It is also undeniably Mattel's punt at keeping Barbie relevant and commercially viable for the next generation.In one fell swoop a corporate, patriarchal brand tries to distance its own corporate image from Barbie ""herself"" whilst also politically sanitising their toy brand at the same time. It's a PR stunt through and through. They want Barbie to be about individuality and self-determination, and that's all well and good; but there's still a corporate brand behind the curtain, even despite the gags (Will Ferrell) alluding to that ironic hypocrisy, such as the groveling admission about ""one or two"" previous Mattel CEOs being women, amongst a long line of men.That aside, on its own merits as a film this was very preachy and very convoluted throughout, the crossover between the two ""worlds"" was a really cool idea that just needed more development and streamlining to land properly. Barbie was well cast (Margot Robbie), as was her playboy, Ken (Ryan Gosling) and the comic relief alter-Ken, Alan (Michael Cera). Many of the ingredients and characters for a good film were present, but the execution fell flat.Somewhere beneath the political hullabaloo the film contains a valid message about mutual respect between the genders and a lesson on self actualisation. But ultimately, the film forgot that Barbie and Ken could have had some *fun* whilst also making the points the film set out to make. Making many of the characters superficial Kens or Barbies made the palette a boring and grating one, even despite the points that were trying to be made about individuality. The film also often lacked the light touch needed to captivate young girls who actually play with Barbie dolls and who won't necessarily understand the high level commentary at play here. Even if a mum or elder sister explains it to them afterwards."
"Opens with a great tribute to 2001: a Space Odyssey's ape sequence, setting the scene for the humour and satire to follow. Barbie and Ken escape from Barbieland into the real world, threatening societal breakdown in both as changes in one universe affects the other. Barbieland is effectively a Matriarchy where girls rule and the Kens just do Beach, play sports, stand around and try to attract the attention of the Barbies. There are all types of Barbies, President Barbie, the Supreme Court Barbie, Roadworker Barbies. Margot Robbie is Stereotypical Barbie with Ryan Gosling as her Beach Ken. They travel to the real world after Barbie starts developing cellulite and worrying about death. Ken learns about patriarchy in the real world, especially from the clever corporate types who affect an image of equality but use this as a cover to carry on in the old manner. Ken returns to Barbieland intent on turning it into a Kendom and turning the world upside down. Barbie faces the all male Executive board of Mattel where the CEO (Ken Ferrell) defends his policies but literally tries to put Batbie in a box. . Cutting satire, great humour in a whipsmart script with wonderful fake pastel sets in Barbieland. The themes and set decoration bring Don't Worry Darling and Asteroid City to mind. Kate McKinnon is Weird Barbie who helps Stereotypical Barbie to solve her personal problems and to battle against the Kendom. I'll have to see this again. I reckon to properly appreciate all the jokes, irony and satire. Greta Gerwig takes no prisoners as she Directs and Co-Writes (with Noah Baumbach) this comic masterpiece. 9/10."
"This movie is many things. One may say it is a story of strength, and finding the beauty in yourself. Others, may just not like it. I am in the middle of all of that. The movie was a little better than meh, but lacked in some aspects that it could have dealt with more. I think Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were good, but I really didn't like their characters (Mostly Ken) The musical numbers and camera work were amazing. But, by far three things stood out to me. One, the costumes design and sets. The directors sculpted amazing set design with colorful costumes to go along with it. My honorable mention is Rhea Perlman. I thought she was phenomenal. While anyone could play that role she really brought it. Finally, America Ferrara. Since her days on Ugly Betty, she has became a household name. But in this movie she was wonderful. I enjoyed Superstore quite a bit and wanted to see Barbie mainly for her character. Her speech was moving and she brought so much to her simple, yet relatable mom."
"I expected this to be horrible, ditzy stereotypes, poor portrayal of each gender, or a best a 2 hour long advertisement for their toys.It was not.I cannot believe I am saying this, but this was an incredibly intelligent film! Prior to seeing it, that is the last thing I would expect to say, but it really was.Clever and witty throughout.Poor gender stereotypes? No, just the opposite. By showing how stereotypes existed in the Barbie world, then the real world and how they would later collide, it shined a light on the challenges of both genders, in again a clever and witty way.A two hour commercial? No, Mattel used it as a way to apologize for some of the mistakes it made with dolls over the years (Sugar Daddy Ken), but even then in such a clever way. This was both an affirmation of what good Barbie has done, but also an apology for all the harm it has caused with unrealistic stereotypes.Yes, it had a social agenda (again a surprise from what I went in expecting), but it succeeded in its goal without hitting you over the head, or with low brow humor.It was clever, witty and intelligent. In other words, exactly what your not expecting."
"Barbie was a fun movie and it visually looked really original. There were some really funny parts and some good acting. I loved some of the throwbacks and songs. Really was laughing at some of the funny moments.The story and pacing was a little off and uneven for me. Couple of the characters felt a little flat to me, but overall it was a well made movie. Some of the songs were really great and the camera work was really good as well. I wish the story felt a little more connected overall. The tone really shifted around a bunch of times and it got a bit distracting. A movie can be funny and serious.. but it just didn't seem to know what tone it wanted to be and was a bit conflicting to me. Overall still enjoyed myself."
"Barbie (2023) is a fantasy comedy film directed by Greta Gerwig and co-written by her and Noah Baumbach, based on the iconic fashion dolls by Mattel. The film stars Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, who go on a journey of self-discovery after their expulsion from Barbieland, a matriarchal society where all women are successful and independent. Along the way, they encounter various challenges and surprises in the real world, a multifaceted exploration of existentialism, consumerism, and femininity.Barbie 2023 is a delightful and refreshing film that celebrates Barbie as a cultural icon and a role model for girls and women of all ages. It is incredibly funny and smart, with a terrific ensemble cast that all go for it in the best ways. It is also a clever and creative film that explores various themes and issues that are relevant and relatable to today's society. It is a film that can appeal to a wide range of audiences, from fans of Barbie to fans of comedy to fans of cinema. It is a film that deserves to be seen and enjoyed on the big screen. Give Gosling the Oscar AND the Grammy!"
"Barbie was a very fun, light-hearted, over-the-top movie that takes you on a wild journey. The fact that it paid homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey's opening sequence earned it extra points for me! Ryan Gosling was great and Margot Robbie was perfectly cast, and the production design was fantastic. A comedy movie should mainly be judged on its comedy, and Barbie for the most part is actually quite funny! I also loved how the narrator speaks over the movie at certain points and delivers some funny lines. This may get some backlash, but I feel Barbie is a movie that earns popularity because it propagates feminist ideals and speaks to the issues women face today, and audiences are willing to look past its flaws to celebrate the movie because the message it portrays is very relevant in society today. I feel the same way with Sound of Freedom. Just because a movie talks about issues you care about, however important they may be, doesn't mean it's the ""greatest movie of all time"" and ""Oscar-worthy"" etc. The plot of Barbie seemed quite interesting to me, how Barbie goes into the real world and the chaos that could cause. But I feel like the movie got TOO drenched in the social commentary and thus didn't give the creative plot idea enough justice. Movies don't have to be so explicit with the social commentary, as shown by movies like 12 Angry Men (1957), which IMO does a far better job at tackling racism and prejudice than any film made today. At certain times, Barbie really blurred the line between being anti-patriarchy and being anti-men. It felt like it was fighting injustice with more injustice, although not throughout."
"The big summer blockbuster of 2023 is a wonderful visual spectacle with a great deal of creative physical comedy, centered in and around the universe of Barbie, Mattel's historic toy doll. Unfortunately, the film tries to be and do much more than what the filmmakers ultimately are able to control and reel in. That a movie about Barbie would be guilty of Americanization is no surprise, and in many ways more than befitting, but the Americanization here isn't just about the history of the toy itself and all its cultural impacts - Barbie also views everything through the eyes of Hollywood anno 2023 - which arguably is a very particular and perhaps not that representative outlook. Instead of utilizing the fine foundation laid in the film's first third, director and co-writer Greta Gervig (Lady Bird, Little Women) gets herself lost in a trite, divisive and most likely futile battle of the sexes, which will leave youths - and perhaps particularly Europeans - feeling confused and conflicted. The filmmakers' supposed toying with stereotypes ultimately becomes more of a playing into them, especially towards the end when Gerwig staggers along desperately looking for closure and something meaningful to say. Alas, Barbie has ended up as a rather sad symptom of our times, when it could have been the wonderfully funny piece of femininity-appraising escapism it started out as. There are nonetheless several highlights here, such as the delightfully absurd opening sequence (a fine nod to Kubrick's 2001), the initial introduction of Barbie and Ken's days in Barbieland, and - of course - their first encounter with the real world."
"This movie is an intelligence test. I saw many comments how people're describing the movie attacks men. It actually doesn't. I am a man, maybe even a stereotypical one - I loved Sigma Ken part, it was hilarious. I have a degree in Economics and love to work out in the gym, watching action movies, dark jokes, drink not cheap beers...I believe the movie told a full of heart story how both sides (men and women) should team work more! The story perfectly told in a satirical way explains in what areas we all struggle. I won't go deep dive in because my short review doesn't contain any spoilers but trust me, the movie tries to be supportive and share a thoughtful and warm message in a fun way. It isn't woke, it doesn't treat the audience like a dumbass, it doesn't tokenise anybody, it doesn't force anything. It represents people lost in the world, trying to find their place and I think it says: Chill out.Don't be mad. Go there with open heart and mind and have fun because I did. Ryan Gosling was fantastic."
"This movie is not only lighthearted but a way of exploring how women are seen within society. To Barbie she views herself as someone that strives to be able to do anything a man could do and to her she thought that mirrored to the real world. The movie fights against the double standards women have themselves and about understanding yourself as an individual. To me, the most touching part was the end when it shows clips of women just laughing and enjoying themselves and I felt it had such a deep message to be proud that I am a woman. It also referenced how just because toy Ken is an accessory to Barbie that doesn't have to be his only personality trait which I believed showed a great way of presenting the film was not only about women's explorations and feelings but men's as well."
"I loved the music , and the fun start.A bit of cheeky humor , and dance choreography.The story was quite confusing, it felt like being glued with superglue and not consistent from the beginning to the end . The ending was quite weird . And switching between the two worlds of the story did not make much sense . The character from the Mattel management did not add any value to the story . If they were edited out , I think no one would even notice a difference .The main male character has done a good job , especially in his macho phase .The female main character was lovely . Absolutely gorgeous and well played ."
"Barbie: the symbol of pink, pastel perfection. An iconic piece of American pop culture for more than 50 years. But nothing can prepare you for her big screen debut.Barbie is a risky and courageous new movie. This is a film that will be discussed and talked about for years to come. Greta Gerwig takes Matel's historic creation, every triumph and failure in its catalogue, and places it all within a complicated and challenging critique of what it means to be a woman. If I could compare it to another movie, I would say it's very reminiscent of Robert Townsend's Hollywood Shuffle. It leaves you wondering what kind of insane negotiations went between the film's creative team and Matel, who is also one the targets of the film's purposeful ire. It is one thing to have completed this film, and absolutely another for it to have also gotten the overwhelming promotional campaign in the months leading up to its release. Gerwig's bet is paying off big time, and you have to admit, that takes a lot of guts.Concept alone certainly isn't the film's only strength. The film is beautiful to look at. The production design is second to none in its meticulous construction of a real-life Barbie paradise. Respectively, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling give fantastic performances with plenty of complexity and dimension. I was the most touched by Rhea Perlman who gives a heartwarming portrayal of the founding mother of Barbieland, Ruth Handler. Gerwig and Baumbauch's screenplay is biting and irreverent, and by the end, nobody is left unscathed. But equally so, I belly laughed quite often and marveled at how well so many of the jokes land. The emotional depth of the film also struck a very powerful cord, complete with an ending montage that can practically leave anyone misty-eyed.Having been released on the same day as Oppenheimer, it's safe to say that the event movie is back and better than ever. After three years of streaming, it can't be overstated how wonderful that is."
"First things first, what was good about this movie. There was no better choice for Barbie than Margot Robbie she's lovely and brilliant. Ryan is also Kenough.Set design is amazing. Musical aspect of this movie is well done, but that's it. Other than this, the movie is mediocre at best. And certainly doesn't live up to what was promised. The biggest letdown was the script, it is trying to be something more even though it's not. If they just stick to comedy instead trying to make this story deep and powerful which makes it dump because it's poorly done and stupid. I understand were was Greta Gerwing aiming at, but why so preachy why so forced. The thing is this movie takes itself so serious at one time and then not so much at another making it a mess. I think if they just stick to the musical comedy aspect instead of overly complicated dramedy, they could have got away with it.Overall this isn't the worst movie ever, it's still above average, the direction is good, the actors is good, everything looks good. But you will probably forget it on the way out."
"Barbie, the doll that destroyed stereotypes and taboos to later generate new ones and destroy them again, arrives at the cinema for the first time and does so masterfully. ""Barbie"" is a film that portrays misogyny from the perspective of the famous doll, the script is a biting criticism of patriarchy, internal problems within feminism, family and social relationships, consumerism and existentialism, all full of humor, in some scenes with a lot of black humor and the result is excellent, capturing what it wants to convey to the public. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is magnificent and together with the production design they bring a fictional country full of fantastic and pink plastics. The soundtrack is tremendous, with a list of songs wisely chosen (with some exceptions). The cast is tremendous, Margot Robbie's performance is realistic and sentimental, proving to be the perfect Barbie in all aspects. Ryan Gosling plays Ken with humor and also gives him perfect dramatic nuances. America Ferrara as a working mother achieves a performance to remember, especially for her powerful monologue. Kate McKinnon gives a highly comic performance and an endearing character of a very unusual Barbie. Rhea Perlman pulls off an incredible performance wittily balancing comedy and drama. Ann Roth in a special participation of a single dialogue and a smile achieved a sublime and unforgettable performance. Helen Mirren with a voice acting as The Narrator describes everything with feeling and passion taking advantage of her imposing voice. Greta Gerwig's work as a director is genius, she manages to capture the ideas of the script, gives it her own style and pays homage to movie classics. ""Barbie"" is the movie event of the year, a rightfully earned title for this current classic."
I took my whole family to this movie thinking it was something we all could enjoy at least a little. My two girls are 6 and 8... I realized going in that it's mostly for adults but I wasn't expecting it to be totally for adults given the theme. Too bad. My oldest daughter was so disappointed by it that she was crying after and didn't understand it to be honest - she thought it was going to be more fun because we watched the trailers over and over. I mean it was a fantastic production and a lot of creativity went into making the Barbie world but why did they have to make the Barbie characters so introspective. So much crying and melodramatic parts for a movie that should be geared towards a kids imagination. And why did the ending need to be so lame. I thought at the very list they could have ended it on a fun note for the kids but the ending really sucked for my daughters.
"I'm not even joking when I say this was the most moving film I've ever seen. Going into this I expected the outcome to be one of two things: either is was going to be very dumb and bad, or it would be absolutely amazing. No in between. And now, I can confidently say that it was absolutely amazing. It made me laugh, it made me tear up, it made me feel so much more than I ever could have expected a movie about Barbies, or any toys in general, to make me feel. I genuinely believe that it is going to be one of the most influential movies of this generation.Before I get into why specifically I loved it so much, I would like to first say that to the men out there that are calling this movie ""man-hating,"" you could not be more wrong. If you think that, then clearly you went in with your own preconceived notions and did not pay enough attention to the message of the movie. I also am a man and this movie delivered a beautifully written feminist message that depicted unfair societal stereotypes placed onto women and proved the reasons why the patriarchy is truly a bad thing. Just because it did that, does not make it man-hating, especially since it also depicted and drew awareness to negative societal pressure placed onto men and their emotions.Now, onto why I really loved this movie. First off, it was very funny and light hearted at exactly the right points. I liked that it left room for dramatic scenes that could really tug at the heart strings and Margot Robbie in particular delivered a very powerful performance. Yes, she had great comedic timing, but her talent really showed in more emotional scenes where Barbie felt she had to still act like her happy smiley self despite the overwhelming sadness she was feeling. Not only that, but the costumes and sets were immaculate. It was not only well written and acted, but clearly a lot of care went into the movie from the crew. Each character, even despite their limited screen time, was fleshed out and everyone did a great job making their characters unique and different from each other.This movie made me think so much. I had to let it fester in my brain for a few days before writing a review because I had so many thoughts. I know many people wished it was more light hearted at times, but I am so glad it wasn't, because if it was, it never could have been as powerful and emotional for me. The writers and directors could have taken a more silly, childish approach, but instead they decided upon a story that could make the world a better place, and I have to commend that.Overall, the Barbie Movie was so much more than I ever could have expected it to be and I urge anyone who hasn't yet to go watch it, especially if you have an open mind and, most importantly, an open heart. As of right now, my rating is a 9/10, but I definitely think it will increase once I inevitably watch it again. I think this movie has the potential to do a lot of good for the world."
"I suspect this is a personal thing. Who you are defines what you may get from this.Me - I'm well into my mid life (had my crisis already thank you). I have daughters and both have watched this. I'm also pretty laid back to life. I encourage my children to be whatever the heck they wanna be and help them as much as I can.Now to the movie.For an afternoon showing, it was 2/3 full and mostly women and girls. Just an observation. But it was.The film is fun. It's tootles along with lots of off beat moments, a great monologue near the end (got teary there), silliness and self awareness (lots of self referential humour).My girls enjoyed it. I did too but not sure it's like 9/10 good. It's definitely enjoyable but 7/10 good.A Barbie movie could have been really bad. Really it could have been. But as has been shown by Lego movie, Detective Pickachu and few others....you can take something predominantly aimed at children and make it into something that both adults and children can engage with.The core message is great.I must say, I have heard a lot about Ryan Gosling being funny. He's ok. At least to me, he wasn't laugh out loud funny. There are much funnier things in this.But it is funny and enjoyable enough.Will Barbie dramatically change the landscape for dialogue? No, I don't think it will. It will though give pause for thought to all those who do go view it.A good, fun movie worth paying for the entertainment."
"Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, l'm in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the ""strong"" woman."
"Greta Gerwig's style is jumping through the screen. The cinematography and set designs are brilliant here, as Barbie goes from Barbie World to the real world. Gotta say, it's particularly touching. I didn't expect to get emotional but the movie got me one or two times. Margot Robbie is a star as always, and her acting absolutely delivers, showing the inner conflicts of the character, all in nuance and sincerity.This film is definitely not for kids, as it focuses on problems and dilemmas adults have to deal with. The writing isn't perfect by any means, but overall Barbie is a pretty fun adventure."
"'Barbie (2023)' truly is an accomplishment, a shockingly successful blend between a mass-appeal blockbuster and a strange slice of surreal existentialism. There isn't anything quite like it and, although it essentially serves as one giant advertisement for its eponymous doll, it feels like a genuine piece of almost outsider art with a great sense of humour and a ton of heart. It's an incredibly well-crafted, confidently bizarre feature that often treats the fourth wall as a suggestion. It's as smart as it is unexpected, as often hilarious as it is emotionally impactful. It has a cracking soundtrack, too, with plenty of excellent original songs. The cinematography, set design and costuming all hit the nail squarely on the head, to the point that the pastel plastic aesthetic of Barbieland is so compelling and so complete that it honestly feels as though the movie has become live-action once Barbie and Ken make their way to the real world, even though the thing has been live-action since its first frame. The performances help with this, too, as the actors not only throw themselves from head to toe into the absurdity needed to fully embody the unreal nature of their characters but also deliver their lines pitch-perfect timing and genuine emotion. All the Barbies and all the Kens (and Allan) are great, but Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling truly are the stars here. The former is absolutely brilliant, nailing the emotional dichotomy of her character's mindset as she undergoes her journey, and the latter just seems as though he's having a great time, living that quintessential Ken lifestyle without an ounce of embarrassment. It's also nice to see Will Ferrell being funny again, popping up as a CEO who seems like he just might be Buddy the Elf all grown up (it's not like he ever stopped being funny, per se, but he's been in some rough movies recently), and America Ferrera is great in her more down-to-Earth yet refreshingly honest role.Although the movie is perhaps a little unfocused at times, its important messaging rings true from beginning to end. It satirises the patriarchy and highlights its inherent ridiculousness without undermining the genuine damage it has caused and continues to cause every second it's allowed to continue. It is, at its heart, a wonderfully feminist film. It seems to have been made by women for women, but it's so universally affecting (not to mention fun) that it resonates with everyone in its audience (as a man, I was more than happy to be along for the ride). Furthermore, its potent feminist elements are only slightly dampened by the fact that they have been packaged into a shiny product that's easily digestible by pretty much everyone (save for the whiny babies whose typically toxic masculinity is so fragile it can actually be threatened by this deeply silly yet deeply truthful movie). The picture does pull back slightly in its third act to take a more centrist approach, which does cause this movement to ever-so-slightly lose its way. However, its nuanced take on the material still feels markedly human and, though it takes a (likely studio-mandated) safe route, the flick goes in the right direction. In fact, it arrives its intended destination mostly unscathed, primarily thanks to its supremely emotionally resonant coda, and this is actually a big win for such a big-budget blockbuster (Mattel do pat themselves on the back quite a bit with their exceedingly generous depiction, but they don't seem to have been scared of a little controversy and that's unusual for a company of their size). That's because using something with such wide appeal to convey feminist ideas is a good way to introduce those ideas to people perhaps unlikely to otherwise seek them out, something that arguably makes the fact that those concepts have to be slightly watered down justifiable in this context; it's almost like feminism 101. Of course, the people who need to hear this stuff the most are already out there burning Barbies at the mere thought of the picture, but those who've perhaps not thought about these things before (perfectly nice but utterly clueless boyfriends, for example) may have learnt something once the credits roll (if they're open-minded enough to allow their perception to be challenged). At the very least, the piece is prompting discussion and will make almost every woman in its audience feel seen in a way they likely haven't by a movie in quite some time.As an aside, I'm not sure how much of the film would work for kids, and it doesn't really seem like they're even part of the intended demographic, but Greta Gerwig and co are clearly more interested in unpacking what Barbie represents as a whole than they are in selling new Barbie toys to children and that's okay. Not every piece of branded media needs to cater to the youngest in its audience, and this is potentially a good way to introduce youngsters to feminism and the patriarchy (I'm not a child psychologist or a parent, though, so perhaps take that with a grain of salt.Ultimately, this surrealist satire is an emotional rollercoaster of an experience that's as silly as it is sincere. It's just such a good time. It's delightfully camp and surprisingly profound, centred around some fantastic performances that bring to life a brilliant screenplay under some amazingly assured direction. It's enjoyable, affecting, funny, heartbreaking, poignant, affirming, exciting, absurd, intelligent, important, slightly unsettling and unlike anything else out there. It's actually something of a miracle in its own way. If you tell me you didn't cry when you watched it, I won't believe you."
"Barbie is the latest toy being turned into a live action movie and stars Margot Robbie(Suicide Squad), Ryan Gosling(La La Land),Michael Cena(Scott Pilgram Vs The World),Alexandra Shipp(A Dogs Way Home),America Ferrara (Ugly Betty)and Will Ferrell(Elf). Directed by Greta Gerwig the film follows Barbie(Robbie) a sophisticated young doll who notices that she is slowly turning human so she goes to the real world to find her previous owner and to meet the CEO boss (Ferrell) to find out why she is malfunctioning.Will she go back to BarbieLand or stay in the real world. Overall I was very surprised by this film. The cinematography was very good if not artificial,the story reminded me of Elf meets The Lego Movie. Ryan Gosling was hysterical as Ken. Also stars Rhea Pherlman from Matilda,Helen Mirren as the narrator who throws fourth wall jokes,singer Dua Lipa as a mermaid and John Cena as a merman. Its a very silly yet stupid film but it's definetly a good movie."
I love this film. It's so what we need right now. A bright and happy movie that makes you smile.The way people have embraced it is amazing. People dressing up to go and see it. It's so cleverly done. Margo Robbie is stunning and brilliant as Barbie. Ryan Gosling was the right pick for Ken. He has that cheeky charm and vulnerability down to a tee. He is such a great performer and dancer. If you ever had a Barbie this will bring back memories. It's got it's political undertones and it's trying to get a message across. But it's a film I think will be doing the rounds for a long time with the likes of Mamma Mia.
"Barbie is the latest toy turned movie adapation and stars Margot Robbie(Birds of Prey),Ryan Gosling(La La Land),Alexandra Ship(A Dogs Way Home),Dua Lipa,Will Ferrell(Elf),America Ferrara(Ugly Betty)and Helen Mirren(Shazam Fury Of The Gods) as the narrator.The story follows Barbie(Robbie) who notices strange things happening to her. She thinks about death,her feet are flat and she shows emotions. So she decides to go to weird Barbie (Kate McKennon) for advice and travels to the real world to find her owner Gloria(Ferrara) and her daughter Sasha to find out why she is malfunctioning. But will Barbie choose the real world or the plastic land of Barbie Land?.Overall I actually liked this film .Yes it's very silly and stupid but it was entertaining. Ryan Gosling was hysterical as Ken who is obsessed with horses and prospecy and the other guys as Ken including new Dr Who Ncuti and Secret Invasion star Kingston Ben Adir and Michael Cena as Allan. I guess if I had to change anything it would be for Barbie to stay in the human world more and actually have them as actual Barbie dolls first like Life Size or even Enchanted animated.If you loved Elf(since Will Ferrell stars in both films and the setting mirrors it too) and The Lego Movie along with adding sexual innuendo and woman's rights along with men's rights then you'll enjoy it. Would I recommend 6 year olds to see it no,unless they have a parent.6/10."
"Oh my goodness, where do I even begin with ""Barbie"" (2023)? This film is an absolute delight and a true masterpiece that will leave you in awe. Directed by the incredibly talented Greta Gerwig and starring the stunning Margot Robbie as the iconic doll herself, ""Barbie"" is a cinematic experience like no other.From start to finish, ""Barbie"" captivates audiences with its seamless blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. Gerwig's direction is nothing short of brilliant as she brings the world of Barbie to life with a perfect balance of humor and depth. The humor, in particular, is off the charts hilarious, with giant laugh-out-loud moments that had me clutching my sides. It's remarkable how the humor appeals to viewers of all ages, making it one of the funniest movies of the year.But what truly sets ""Barbie"" apart is its profound and thought-provoking narrative. The film revolves around Barbie's existential crisis and her quest to find meaning in her existence. This exploration of Barbie's identity as a feminist symbol is incredibly compelling and challenges societal norms and expectations surrounding femininity and girlhood. Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals? This deep, existential question lingers long after the credits roll, prompting introspection and discussion.Margot Robbie's performance as Barbie is nothing short of extraordinary. She brings a charisma and depth to the character that is truly captivating. Watching her journey of self-discovery unfold on screen is an absolute joy. And let's not forget Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken, which complements Robbie's Barbie perfectly. Their on-screen chemistry is off the charts and adds another layer of excitement to the film.I should mention that ""Barbie"" has received widespread acclaim from both critics and audiences, and it's easy to see why. It strikes a perfect balance between appealing to longtime fans and captivating new audiences. The movie's mass appeal transcends age, gender, and previous Barbie doll opinions, making it a delightful and engaging experience for viewers of all backgrounds.Despite its PG-13 rating, ""Barbie"" remains family-friendly and suitable for teenagers and older kids. The clever marketing of the film ensures that it appeals to a wide range of audiences, making it a perfect choice for family movie nights.In conclusion, ""Barbie"" is an absolute triumph in every aspect of filmmaking. With its stellar cast, innovative approach, brilliant humor, and profound exploration of societal themes, it more than deserves a perfect 10/10 rating. This cinematic gem is a must-watch for anyone seeking an enchanting and thought-provoking experience that transcends the boundaries of age and nostalgia. Brace yourself to be dazzled and captivated by the delightful world of ""Barbie."" Trust me, you won't be disappointed!"
"Barbie (2023) is a movie that my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows Barbie in a perfect world who believes she is the perfect role model for little girls in the real world. When things start feeling off for her in her world, she discovers she may need to go to the real world to set things right. When she gets to the real world, she discovers how wrong she was about being the perfect role model.This movie is directed by Greta Gerwig (Little Women) and stars Margot Robbie (Suicide Squad), Issa Rae (Insecure), Kathryn McKinnon (Bombshell), Ryan Gosling (The Notebook), Alexandra Shipp (X-Men: Apocalypse) and Will Ferrell (Elf).This movie had a lot more going for it than I anticipated. The universe and characters are very well developed, thoroughly put together with the history of the Barbie universe incorporated and a smart scripts. The dialogue and interactions were much deeper than I anticipated. There were a lot of good messages and lessons baked into the storyline. My only complaint was how much focus there was on the ""Ken's."" He was a worthwhile villain, but the ending dance scene and finding self moment was overdone; however, everything about the Barbie plot hit the nail on the head.Overall, this is better and deeper than I expected and was definitely worth a watch. I would score this a 7/10 and strongly recommend it."
"Fantastic movie! The writing and storyline is so much deeper than I could have imagined for a Barbie movie. I loved this movie so much that I saw it twice opening week and plan to buy it once it hits streaming. I think women and girls of all ages will love it. I know plenty of guys who like it as well. It's smart, funny, clever, deep, thoughtful, etc. I was actually in tears during the America Ferrera monolog. These actors are all amazing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gossling were the perfect Barbie and Ken. The music was amazingly hilarious. The Ken battle scene cracked me up so much. Greta Gerwig is a phenomenal. I loved her version of Little Women and this is every bit as good. Barbie is a must see. Don't wait, go see it now!"
"Barbie was an entertaining movie, but was definitely not worth the hype that accompanied the film. The messages the movie wanted to share were so on the nose and explicit that it became jarring and weird. The movie also meandered from place to place and didn't seem to have a purpose for the majority of its run time.Ryan Gosling was hilarious though and stole every scene he was in. Several of the cameos were also great.Had fun, but wouldn't really recommend it as a 'must watch'. Mostly watched it as the first part of the Barbenheimer meme, so it was worth it for that reason at least.7/10."
"I am not surprised in the least that the Barbie movie is trash and a truly deplorable career choice by Margot Robbie who will probably be type cast forever in Barbie-type roles.To begin with, there is just too much pink and superficiality for this movie to inspire anything more than groans and watching your watch waiting for the whole travesty to be over. The plot is completely by the numbers as Barbie has the perfect life in Barbie World. Then suddenly she yearns to see the ""real world."" Where did we see that storyline before? Let's see... I know... The Little Mermaid and a hundred other movies ripping off the same plot.But if that's not bad enough, we have to sit through dreary dialogue such as Ken wanting to sleep over with Barbie while being totally innocent of sex and the fairy god mother pressuring Barbie to reject the high heels in order to seek enlightenment, as if Barbie should not make the choice on her own without somebody prodding her in a particular direction.Even the people who like it can't point to anything original in it. Where that 77% comes from is beyond me."
"4.5 out of 5 stars.Barbie is a pretty good fantasy comedy film that delivers all expectations with a film being based on a beloved doll and toy brand. It is fun. It is dumb in a fun way that adults and children will love which has a story with a theme. Humor and fun characters.Margot Robbie delivers as Barbie. And along with Ryan Gosling as Ken. And rest of the cast ensemble had fun with there roles. Its a story about Barbie played by Margot Robbie who decides to leave barbieland after she has been feeling different about herself. While coming into the real world with Ken. To find out who has been playing with her doll version.Humor is a lot of fun that is entertaining in about every scene. The music soundtrack is awesome. The flashy visuals can be cheesy and knows how to be fun and not taken seriously.Overall, it is one fun summer film that everyone will enjoy."
"Barbie wasn't supposed to be that deep but it was. Greta Gerwig must have wielded a pen that ignites to write this story down with so much boldness, creativity, and awareness that no one could ever imagine for an already perfect plastic to deserve.It wasn't a surprise Margot Robbie could kill this role and make us all believe she was born for this because she was. She is my favorite actress after all. She led the film as perfectly as her Barbie but it was Ryan Gosling that took me by surprise with how much he embodied kenergy that came so explosive like some atomic bomb designed by some civilian scientist (pun intended). Then there's America Ferrera (watch out for the scenes that earned her the ""heart of the film"" ribbon) and the scene Billie Eilish's ""What Was I Made For"" was made for. (If I were to predict with all confidence who's bagging an Oscar nomination? It's Billie for Original Song.)Barbie indeed subverted expectations and stereotypes. And I hate that it worked, that's why I loved it."
"BARBIEHEIMER is among us! Between BARBIE and OPPENHEIMER releasing on the same week, the wife really wanted to see this first and I obliged.BARBIE is definitely bound to have some divisiveness due to its ""feminism"" - and yes a lot of feminism (honestly what did you expect). Not addressing this is like not addressing the nuclear bomb in OPPENHEIMER. For a movie about a children's toy, I got to give it some kudos for its subversion and tying to put out a message this big. I'm not shocked that the film focused a bit more on the reality elements of the real world as opposed to the fantasy side. A lot of that is because this is a Greta Gerwig film (co-written with her partner Noah Baumbach) and she is one of the best working director/writer today.The unconventional approach is something to admire. The film swings with these metaphysical ideas and existential crisis. The performances from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling carry the film. Robbie tackles the role very well. The story asks her to do a lot, and Robbie showcases Barbie's awakening with sincerity, terror, confusion, naivety, humor and bittersweet acceptance. Gosling gets to cut loose and be funny. He goes on his own journey to discovering who he is so there's layers to his Ken as well. He also has a funny rivalry/banter with Simu Liu's Ken.Rest of the supporting cast are a bit underdeveloped, but they get moments to shine here and there and serve the plot in motion. Some highlights are Kingsley Ben-Adir, Issa Rae, Michael Cera and Kate McKinnon.America Ferrara and Ariana Greenblatt are the human mother/daughter duo in the film. Ferrara's character delivers a monolog that is very on the nose and at that point you're with it or meh about it. For me personally, I honestly don't mind it as long as its entertaining, and to the film's credit it was, for at least the first act of the film. It's at its best with the self aware meta humor, but eventually the film gets too carried away and takes itself too seriously, loosing its humor and leaving us experiencing moments that are a bit of a chore to sit through.One could say it was refreshing to watch an incredibly self aware film that isn't afraid to be bold in its message, but for me, while I agree with the underlying message it's very heavy handed and preachy. I connected more when the film explored the nature of Barbie's character. There's one scene that tackles Barbie's legacy directly that raised the existential crisis for her, but it isn't revisited in favor of telling a bigger societal story.Production design, the sets and visuals are very well done. Shoutout to production designer Sarah Greenwood and set decorators Katie Spencer. I feel like Barbie could take home the Oscar for production design. When you're in Barbie Land, the overall usage of pink and the plastic feel makes the whole experience feel immersive. Cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto makes the film feel like you're there. It has a vibrant and inviting energy that you can't help but gaze at.I am curious how some families who saw the film feel about it as some might have expected a more straight forward approach, as opposed to this more nuanced subversive take, but I think overall the film is destined to be enjoyed overall and successful. It just might get a sequel if it can rake in the money, which it looks like it will.As a male, this film isn't made for me. I'm obviously not the target audience for it. However, the film did enough to make me feel engaged where I laughed at some jokes, but the second half is where I felt the film was talking at me instead of engaging me as a viewer. It flirts with being a unique fantasy/real world introspective story, but then seems to be more interested in making a point by the end of it.6/10."
"This is a masterpiece with little to no short-cuts taken on everything that makes a film great - writing, wardrobe, make-up, choreography, set, acting etc. The cast is incredible. Margot Robbie fits the role of Barbie so well. Ryan Gosling (IMO) steals the show as Ken. I found his performance to be the stand-out. I always love seeing Issa Rae anywhere and I think she should be everywhere because she's so talented. I can't say enough about America Ferrera's monologue rant - the writing of that monologue was spectacular but Ferrera's delivery of it was one of my favourite scenes in this movie.I think Greta Gerwig's work here is incredible and I think this movie will be remembered for many years to come."
"This movie is an excellent marketing product. Cinemas were full, Even in Baku city. It was very difficult to find tickets. People dressed in pink clothes were coming to this event. I wore my black shirt and went. I think the movie was not good. I fell asleep in some scenes. There were lots of boring speeches. The movie was fun, that's obvious, but I didn't laugh much. This movie became one of the most different and crazy events of our day. I don't think it has any value as a movie. It was indeed a bad movie, but as an event it was fun. I don't regret. There were some references. I liked most of them. The acting wasn't bad, I think it was good. I was getting bored again near the end of the movie. Anyway, I think it was a crazy and fun event, but it was a bad movie."
"I'm not a Barbie fan. The only time I loved Barbie was when she was in the Toy Story movies. But that changed after I saw the Barbie movie. This movie is not only Greta Gerwig's best film but also the year's greatest movie so far!!!!! Margot Robbie (my favorite actress of all time) is beautiful and portrays Barbie with pure perfection!!! And then there's Ken (played by Ryan Gosling in a career-best performance)!!! Robbie and Gosling shine and are easily the years best duo.The story starts with Barbie doing her usual routine in Barbieland, a land filled with multiple Barbies, each with a different occupation. The Ken's also visit playing the roles a woman would play. Barbie starts experiencing real emotional symptoms like thinking about death, crying and flat feet. She learns from Weird Barbie that the Real World will have the answers to her questions. Barbie than travels with Ken to the real world and find out many things : Barbie is a doll played by a grown woman named Gloria (America Ferrera in her best movie performance), Mattel wants to put Barbie back in the box and Ken learns about America's patriarchy and men rule the world. All of these problems combine into a hilarious comedy that provides great messages about woman empowerment and being who you want to be.The production design of Barbieland and costumes of all the Barbies and Kens are Oscar-worthy. The soundtrack is pretty solid with two great songs: Ryan Gosling's 80s ballad called I'm Just Ken and Billie Ellish's emotional song at the end of the movie, ""What was I made for?"".The direction of Greta Gerwig is finally put to great use in Barbie as she's goes to make the best comedy in years and the script she wrote with her partner Noah Baumbach is the perfect mixture of stupid comedy, great-comedy drama and emotional drama.Gosling gives his best and definitely deserves an Oscar nomination as his role of Ken is up there with the comedy greats of Meliss Mccarthy in Bridesmaids and Robert Downey Jr. In Tropic Thunder.The real scene stealer is Margot Robbie. Robbie has been in multiple box office failures but Barbie changed that. She's been nominated twice for the Oscar for her incredible performances in I, Tonya and Bombshell. My favorite actress is about to be nominated for Best Actress and Best Picture for Barbie!!!! Margot Robbie is astonishing and a tour de force in Barbie, which is the best performance of her whole career!!! Go Margot Robbie!!!!!This movie is definitely worth watching!!!!!! I want to watch it again!!!!!!"
"I saw Barbie, starring Margot Robbie-Babylon, the Suicide Squad movies; Ryan Gosling-Blade Runner 2049, La La Land; America Ferrera-Superstore_tv, Ugly Betty_tv; Kate McKinnon-SNL_tv, Ghostbusters_2016 and Will Ferrell-Holmes & Watson, the Daddy's Home movies.This is a weird, funny and thought provoking movie about a doll that was created in 1959 by Ruth Handler. Before the movie starts, there are several music videos with singers and stars from the film. The movie then goes straight to Barbie Land, where everything is pink-Barbie's favorite color-and everyone sings and dances a lot. Margot is the main Barbie-there are lots of them, of course, as well as Kens-and Ryan is the main Ken. Everything is going along like usual for Margo until she starts having visions of death and despair. The rest of the Barbies tell her to consult with Kate-the weird Barbie-and Kate tells her that she must go to the real world and find out the source of her problems. Ryan goes with her and they both discover that in the real world, it's not run by Barbies but instead by men. Will plays the CEO of Mattel and America is his secretary. There are messages about feminism and the role of the Barbie doll in shaping little girls' minds-both good and bad-and there are several cameos of actors you may recognize, as Ken and Barbie.It's rated PG-13 for some language and some sexual innuendo-mostly just jokes-and has a running time of 1 hour & 54 minutes.Although I would probably not buy it on DVD, it is entertaining and would be a good one to stream."
"My husband asked me to compare this to something else to ally, and my first thought was Elf. In these ways it lives up to one of the greatest movies of all time - both are hilarious, have wonderful musical numbers, heartwarming, will make you tear up, complicated parental storylines, unlikely character bonding, and whimsical visual tie-ins/world-building + bonus of both having Will Ferrel to boot.I loved the soundtrack - the Lizzo song being a fun 4th wallesque/narrator-y way to introduce Barbieland.The pace was even - I never felt it was moving too quickly or wanting a scene to wrap up.Some more unexpected show-stealers were Simu Liu and Arianna Greenblatt.The haters are simply mad this is a film that is self-aware and for a new generation."
"I went into the film having high expectations, the marketing for Barbie has been really effective, I have to give them that. I had also heard good things about the movie from friends and co-workers. So I went to the cinema with my friend, dressed in pink.I was expecting a funny, girly movie with some clever commentary on patriarchy and existentialism. Instead, I found it to be campy and over the top. Campy can be fun, and there were one or two chuckle-worthy moments. But I wouldn't describe it as a funny comedy. Maybe it's because we're from Northern Europe, but the audience certainly wasn't laughing at many moments. I recall Ryan Gosling causing a few chuckles here and there though, he's got great comedic timing.The social commentary wasn't very subtle, the message was overly clear. It was so exaggerated that I found myself cringing at the lines and scenes. It could've been done much more elegantly, but it's clear that they didn't have high expectations of their audiences' intelligence.But there were some highlights too, of course: Barbieland looked amazing and I loved the costume design. Ryan Gosling was lovable and funny, even as a loser Ken. Margot Robbie was convincing as Barbie. The music fit well.Lastly, I wish I had gone into the movie without any expectations. I probably would've enjoyed it more then. It was relatively entertaining but I don't think that I'll be rewatching it. As a feminist I was disappointed in how on the nose the social commentary was. It could've been done with so much more grace and respect for the audience's intelligence. I also didn't like the way the dialogue was written over all, it was very ""wannabe-intellectual"" which I didn't find to be very funny at all. Maybe it's just the American humor that doesn't suit me."
"First of all: Margot Robbie is great in the role of Barbie and I also loved the quirky colorful style of the movie from start to finish. Both the pink dominated Barbieland and also the transition over to the real world are well done in my opinion.Unfortunately there isn't much more to the movie than that. The story and its conclusion can be summarized in one sentence: Neither a male nor a female dominated world is good and we need to find a solution that works for both men and women. That's it, that's all.The story revolves around the word ""patriarchy"" with a few jokes sprinkled inbetween, none of which really worked for me. What's left is the empty feeling of lost potential.The main plot element of the first few minutes, the fact that Barbie suddenly isn't perfect anymore and has to deal with thoughts about death and anxiety while everyone around her keeps up the facade of perfection (that sounds interesting, right?), is almost completely ignored in favor of what I pointed out above; the same goes for the missed opportunity of seriously addressing the consumption culture that led to the creation of this ""perfect"" Barbieland in the first case. Yes, there's the running gag with Will Ferrell as a CEO and a bunch of other men in suits following him around but the few jokes that result out of this create nothing more than a cynical smile at best. It will not get you to actually think about or question anything in the real world which should be the goal of any good story. If you're lucky you might leave the theatre slightly amused but not with any new interesting thoughts or follow up questions on your mind.Then in its feminist territory where the movie does attempt to be critical, we mostly get these revelations about patriarchy and the oppression of women handed to us in embarrassing monologues. How can anyone enjoy this? 4/10 for the style and the acting."
"It is a philosophical masterpiece. Clever and thought provoking, hilarious and modern. I didn't expect that at all. The constructed reality is as complex as if Morpheus from ""the Matrix"" offered you the third pill which conjoins two worlds. Deserves the hypeI hope I don't dive super deep here, if I say that the beginning reminds me of Wlater Benjamin's ""Berlin Childhood"". Playing with toys knows to be joyful and lucid, but really reats some new and confusing ""realty"". To add up, this movie seems to be much more philosophical than ""The Matrix"", I would say. That dimension opens up right afterer ""blue pill vs red pill"" reference was made, because here we hd those two realities colide, ""imagenary"" and ""real*, creating the conjoined ""third realm"" where we see how both realites influence and shape each other. As Slavoj Zizek once pointed out: ""we need a third pill"", so here it is.At that point in the movie, story takes a new turn bringing into the focus some familiar social & existential struggles of modern times, providing us with its own critique of it. And it llooks like they had great success doing it. Seemingly effortlessly, they manged to bring out some greater point, keeping the great dynamics, adding the great amount of comedy to it. That was actually so impressive.Here ill pull the breaks, I would rather not to try to explain the movie or interprete it, .. Just wanna to say in the end that I strongly rrecommend it for watching. It's fun, profound, its reveling and bringing out so many different layers talking about the social/existential dilemas and actually you can learn much from watching it. And In the end, it gives the right amount of optimism."
"Ryan Gosling as Ken I loved too much, but Margot Robbie as Barbie is perfect.I understood the message very well, it's great to see how they destroy little by little the stereotypes of a ""pretty"" person and replace it with the reality that many human beings live. And after all, men and women (and every living being) deserve to be happy.One of the scenes I loved, aside from the opening reference, is the ""Just Ken Exclusive"" scene. I would have loved to see more of Ken!!!! And don't forget that you can be whatever you want to be.By the way, I absolutely hated the advertising to a certain car brand."
"It feels like its been some time since a film release has gripped the world quite like the way in which Barbie has over recent weeks/months, with the Greta Gerwig directed box office sensation creating a global phenomenon that has translated to record breaking openings in cinemas, critical plaudits and audience adoration on a scale that is mostly just a dream for Hollywood bigwigs.A talent-laden affair in front of the camera with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling leading the charge as plastic icons Barbie and Ken respectively and also behind the camera with Gerwig teaming up with her real life partner Noah Baumbach to bring Matel's beloved creation to life, Barbie is far better than it has any right to be as we explore Barbie Land and the real world with our protagonists, in what amounts to a pink fever dream that recalls old school Tim Burton at its peak, Barbie is also a little too heavy handed in the way in which it hammers home its messaging, making the film one that doesn't always correctly balance its oddball charm with preachy messaging.A film that in many ways had become too big too fail with anticipation around the one half of Barbenheimer (with the weighty Oppenheimer no doubt benefiting hugely from the cross promotion) reaching fever pitch levels all over the globe, the adoration aimed at Gerwig's film right now feels like the type of over the top praise that will be reevaluated in coming months/years too something more grounded, with Gerwig and her team deserving of praise for creating such a colourful world and giving us something that doesn't just feel like a two hour long toy commercial but also going over the top in its empowerment messaging that feels like a message swung too far into the direction of all men are patriarchal menaces who aren't deserving of the women in their lives.At its best when it allows its stars a chance to play within the confines of a likeable fish out of water tale where Barbie and Ken roam the boardwalks of Venice Beach adorned in skin tight Lycra or where Gosling's MVP performance as Ken see's the horse obsessed and Matchbox 20 loving beach bound man child bring too life a range of hilarious situations and sentiments, Barbie gets bogged down when it turns its attention to preaching too the converted and fails to make the most of its ""human"" characters like America Ferrera's Gloria or Will Ferrell's unnecessary tickle loving Mattel CEO, forgoing its comedic charms to try and be something it might naturally have become anyway had it dialled back the politics and just decided to be the fun escapist entertainment it often utilises.When fun and adventure is at the forefront of Barbie's agenda, Gerwig's film is an undeniable delight and you'd be hard pressed to recall a more colorful and playful film when Barbie is in full flight but with all the hyperbole coming thick and fast right at this moment in time, it's hard not too consider Barbie's public sentiments being blown up out of proportion as the films misses are overlooked in favour of viewers preferring to watch this cultural touchstone with a pair of (pink) rose-tinted glasses.Final Say -There's fun to be had from Barbie and the commitment of its two leads is a sight to behold, as is the world which Gerwig brings to life but when Barbie forgoes the fun and playfulness it thrives in in favour of repetitive messaging, the film becomes more of a slog than an enjoyment.3 Mojo Dojo Casa House's out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
"I didn't know how many points to give it but I give it a 10 because I have no negatives, I went to watch this movie at the premiere and it was great. The actors did a great job wow! The outfits were also on point. And the easter eggs to Barbies that they were no longer allowed to make was also fun. And the Barbies in the real world was kinda fun how they did was really well done.

"The colors, shots, houses, clothes were really amazingly done. Margot and Rayan were amazing, beautiful and acted well. I will say that. I find that the movie wasn't THAT good. The story wasn't as entertaining as it could. This was supposed to be like a childrens show with adult humor and topics but I didnt find most of the jokes funny, i felt like they were just screaming stuff in your face instead of being more subtle. I wish some aspects of the characters and side stories were explored more. The ending was okay but i wished for something diffrent and again more about the side characters. Ken is a cool character i gotta say. He deserves the world and to really find something more about him. So i wouldn't say it was a bad movie, its okay to watch more casually, more so to appreciate the dolls and the nostalgia. I was lowkey dissapointment with all the hype i gotta say.Ps. I find it weird that this is considered such a ""woke"" movie but did not mention that boys can play with dolls ONCE. Like cmon I had a Barbie too!"
"From the opening scene, Barbie knows exactly what movie she is and what she has to say. Everything from the legacy of Barbie as a brand to the mass misunderstanding of her purpose are all handled eloquently and addressed in such a light way it keeps the movie on track without becoming a thinkpiece.The shortage of pink paint that followed this movie completely makes sense once you step inside the bright world of Barbie's dream house. What follows the __funny__ Space Odyssey recreation opening scene is a humorous but touching commentary on the journey of womanhood. Hilarious from start to finish, but will likely jump up some tears at the relatability.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling could not have been replaced by anyone else in this film; they run this film flawlessly. The Oscar-buzz surrounding Gosling's performance of Ken is not out of nowhere. Unlike any other role he's played before, it showcases his range in the comedy arena as well as giving him the opportunity to exemplify his showman qualities in a new genre. Robbie is the perfect mix of peppy, smart and sensitive to be Stereotypical Barbie and always has us rooting for her.The soundtrack is immaculate and lends to the overall experience of the Barbie world while blending it with the real world by featuring so many popular artists. The bubbly vibe and fun attitude of the movie paints a great background while clearing up the mixed messaging about what Barbie was made for and the intended impact of her invention for better and for worse.Strongly recommended for everyone; bring tissues!"
"I have seen this film in theaters twice now and I can safely say that I thought it was amusing, entertaining, and fun. However, I won't lie to you and say that it's really all that groundbreaking as some seem to claim. While this movie focuses on heavy topics such as inequality and feminism, some of the scenes that had primarily concentrated on them had felt a little shallow. I am not saying that this wasn't a great film, as said before, it delivered most if not all of the checkpoints that modern day society defines a ""good movie"" with. Now I can't say that I wasn't entertained mostly through the movie but it just lacked something. The longer this film had stuck with me the longer it felt insufficient. People that are currently speaking on this movie seem to pin up its success in presenting femininity and women's issues in a lighthearted and joyful manner, however I feel that the overall message in this movie could have been provided in a more severe tone. The creators of Barbie stated that this was an ""everyone movie"", that this film was designed to cater to all viewers, but did it have to? The laughable tone this movie brought along with its own narrative of modern day feminism sort of cheapened the message. Don't get me wrong, all the acting in the movie was phenomenal for the roles each actor portrayed, but it felt like some of the plot had gotten lost in translation. Even after watching the movie twice I still am a little fuzzy on the entirety of ""Barbieland"". Where is this really set?, why it is a common occurrence of dolls making their way into the real world?, why do barbies know they're toys? I might just be inattentive but these plot point were rarely touched on through the film and still leave me confused. Overall I think my main issue with this film is my regrettable rating, I really didn't want this movie to be below a 9. I was really looking forward to this film and eagerly waiting to ""do anything to see it in theaters again"", but it turned out to be just ok. A word I can describe my expectations for this movie is iconic, but it just fell flat in that department. Would I recommend? Yeah why not, but would I jump at the opportunity to see it again ever? Probably not."
Family/adult film mashed in really well! The trailer barely shows anything about how deep the movie is; I really appreciate that! I'm sure production design will surely get recognition at the Oscars I love that they used so much pink they had to get more. I saw it inRPX with my sister Emily which was quite spectacular except for several audience members that were obnoxious and barely seemed into the movie those people like that are strange.I probably laughed at more parts than most people and was engaged throughout. Greta Gerwig made an important film with plenty of charm for everyone involved.
The movie was weirdly quick at the beginning and weirdly long at the end. The beginning of the film felt like a glorified way to show off Margot Robbie's feet. The movie it self was quite meta at times and even made me laugh but I felt like it had too much hype. Also was the movie about sexism or getting older and was Will Ferril the villain or was Ken. There were just somethings that didn't need to be in this. Greta Gerwig is a great director Wonder Woman proves that it's just this movie could have been different. I Manley started re-enjoying the movie was when the kens had their battle. Sorry if I have wasted your time but that's my opinion.
"I played with barbies a lot as a kid, so I thought this movie was going to be fun. The trailer looked great, I thought, why not, let's have a girls movie night, kick back relax, watch a funny iconic movie about my favorite toys as a kid. But I was greatly let down really fast. The movie was all about a strong message of what a woman is, what a man is, how the world defines those roles and how we should just be whoever we are. There was nothing in the movie that made me laugh. It all felt kinda heavy with the message they were telling. It's definitely not a kids movie either, I don't think they would understand half of it. Really wasn't happy with the movie."
"Didn't really know what to expect from this, but this is one of the best films of the year. Laugh-out-loud funny and heartfelt, Margot and Ryan Gosling throw themselves head first into Barbie and Ken like some kind of Zoolander/Legally Blonde/Lego Movie hybrid, but far more intelligently written.Jam packed with in-jokes, sly references and even a Mattel-censored F-bomb, Barbie is relentlessly entertaining from start to finish. Most of the satire will fly over kids' heads, as we had a theatre-full of Belgrave's finest letting their vile offspring literally run riot under the screen.Luckily, the movie was so good we kept our teacher voices to ourselves. Over to Oppenheimer on Sunday. 9/10."
"I went to see this one with my 11 year old daughter, thinking that it would be a movie directed to kids. It's not! Actually, it's one of the best social satires I have seen and many jokes and references will be difficult or even impossible to understand for kids. They'll still be having a good time, but it's the adults that are actually in for the big treat. I absolutely loved it and recommend this to everyone who loves a clever satire with a lot of heart and mesmerizing cinematography.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are perfect in their roles, the script/story is engaging, funny but also very touching at times and the overall result is delightful.You'll find yourself wanting to own this one in your collection, it really is that good."
"I went to see this movie without even seeing the trailer first. I'm a 42 yo man and people kept posting stuff about this movie on social media, so when a friend asked me to go watch it, I said yes...I was expecting some kind of dumb movie, but this is not. It appeals to teenagers but also to an older audience. I loved the sense of humor, Mattel was sometimes laughing at themselves too. I found that very nicely done. The acting is amazing. However I liked the first part of the movie more than the second one. It starts to analyze the patriarchy a bit too heavily for my taste. They want to make it clear that this is a feminist movie. They want to clear Barbie's image of the stereotypes she's been associated with for decades: she's not a blonde and skinny perfect bimbo girl. Barbie is a feminist, she represents empowered women. I keep questioning myself about this point of view: little girls have been associating the idea of beauty with Barbie for so long, so my idea of Barbie has been quite the opposite throughout my life. I find it hard to accept it.Now let's talk about Ken. He only exists because Barbie exists. In Barbie Land he counts nothing. There is a deep criticism toward the patriarchy which I can understand but goes slightly too far for my taste..."
"I expected a funny, easy-going movie that you can watch while scrolling on your phone. I was amazed by the depth of the story. Feminism done right, without the overly woke culture that is cringey and contraproductive in most cases. A must see if you're capable of seeing beyond the pitch perfect pink world. :) Wasn't sure about Ryan Gosling as Ken, the match seemed off, but after seeing the movie I think he did great. Helen Mirren is the narrator which is also amazing. Beautiful story abour equality, feminism, finding your role in the world and also about the importance of finding yourself in the big world."
"Barbie (2023) :
Movie Review -Barbie Review: Greta Gerwig's Barbie movie is a breezy, funny, pinky, and girly Ride Into Barbieland. These four soft adjectives are enough to describe the Barbie movie. Greta Gerwig takes us into Barbie land with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling to deliver a possible fantasy that we all dreamed of as children or as adults. Being a boy, I couldn't have a Barbie doll in my childhood, but I did have a close look at her with my female cousins playing with her, doing make-up, dress-up, and all the girly stuff. And I don't think any boy is unaware of Barbie and Ken, even if he hasn't played with them in childhood. It's a fascination for us and a dream come true for girls. I am not at all hesitant to admit that if I were a girl, I would have enjoyed this movie more than I actually did as a boy. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it, and that's more than enough for today's social media gender ego system.Barbie begins with the inception of Barbie and how she appeared on earth (if we call it that in this fantasy movie). This very scene is a lot of fun when you see Margot Robbie appearing in black and white checks in one piece and little girls breaking their dolls into pieces. Soon, we are transported into Barbie Land, where all Barbies are living happily. All the women are self-confident, working in top positions, successful, and enjoying life to the fullest, while all Kens are jobless and do nothing but try to mingle with barbies. Our stereotypical Barbie (Robbie) suddenly begins to dysfunction and sense the morality of human life. She has to travel to the human world to find out who the child is who is calling her to be there. Obviously, Ken (Gosling) forces his company on her. However, things go wrong for Barbie in the real world, where she realises she is not loved anymore, whereas Ken finds a motto of patriarchy. Ken returns and takes over Barbieland by persuading other Kens and brainwashing the rest of the babies there. Here, distraught Barbie finds Gloria (America Ferrera), a Mattel employee, who is the catalyst of her existential crisis. Gloria began playing with her daughter Sasha's (Ariana Greenblatt) Barbie toys while experiencing her own identity crisis, inadvertently transferring her concerns to Stereotypical Barbie. Gloria restores Barbie, and then they take off on a mission to bring back all Barbies.It's been a while since we have seen a good-budget comedy movie, so Barbie certainly ends the dry spell. I mean, this one is a fun ride from start to end. It may be a little childish-oh, that's a bad word-let's say child-friendly, but it's damn funny. The humour is girlish, yes, but I liked it too. From Zack Snyder, The Godfather, cautionary note on Margot's casting to slapstick one-liners, Barbie is such a colourful comedy. It does not look like an intelligent film; rather, it stages itself as a crazy comedy. That's one of the points I'd say went wrong in the climax. These characters aren't supposed to be smart, but they intend to be when it comes to ending the show. Why? Pixar's Toy Story had the simple but subtle philosophy that a toy should be a toy for a lifetime. It may have many owners, but its job is to stick to them and be loyal, because that's why we humans love them. Barbie challenges this universally accepted theory and goes against the tide. Now, whether it's good or bad, I leave that choice to you since my personal opinion isn't very affirmative about this theory.Barbie was meant to be a career-defining role for Margot Robbie, and she made sure that you'd remember her forever as Barbie. I kept looking for a single frame where she would not look pretty, and I couldn't find it for 110 minutes. I melted, man. Ryan Gosling's Ken is the funniest character in the whole movie. That cute flirting, those reluctant expressions, jealousy, arrogance, and at last self-discovery-this man has lived the character. Kate McKinnon's weird Barbie appears for a short time but serves enough. Other babies, including Issa Rae, Hari Nef, Alexandra Shipp, Emma Mackay, Dua Lipa, Sharon Rooney, Ana Cruz Kayne, Ritu Arya, and Nicola Coughlan, are all gorgeous. On the other hand, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Scott Evans, Simu Liu, Rob Brydon, Ncuti Gatwa, and John Cena as Kens add fine support. Michael Cera, Ariana Greenblatt, and Will Ferrell pass the time well, while Rhea Perlman's cameo is blasting. The biggest cheer in the Barbie movie came for America Ferrera's monologue, which describes the struggle and victory of feminism. Ariana Greenblatt steals the show in the first, and the rest of the cast has done well.Made on a budget of $145 million, Barbie is a lavish big screen entertainer, as the production design makes sure you feel the fantasy right. Those fakish items could have been excluded, but having them there is kind of fun in itself. Who's to blame? Rodrigo Prieto's camera does the talking with close-ups and long shots of Barbie and Ken. Barbie does not have any loo breaks, courtesy of Nick Houy's superb editing, and the music is lovable. Some people often say that a female director and female lead's pair is something else, and I have to accept that Barbie could have been a lot less underwhelming without Greta Gerwig. This woman has made a world that is so adorable and so rummy. A few flaws are there in the script and the characters, but since we are not discussing an artistic masterpiece of cinema, let's Chuck that discussion. Let's enjoy this pinky and girly entertainer, which is sure to take female audiences by storm and leave a good enough impact on men too. Not to forget, who's writing it.RATING - 6/10*"
"Barbie was hilarious, emotional and exciting. I LOVED the wardrobe and props - very colorful and exact replicas of what I played with in the 90s. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with this movie - casting was perfect. I especially loved the humor and emotional grasp this movie had on the audience in the movie theatre. This is definitely a feel good movie and I hope they continue the franchise. I have to note that this movie had twists and turns at every corner, in good way! There is a lot of action, dancing and surprise ha ha moments. This is perfect for families and adults really; go see it!"
"LIKES:The Setting:
-It feels like a Barbie world in real life and captures the energy of the doll in all glory.-Plenty of accessories, the plastic feeling, and the toy like atmosphere with real life people is totally captured and super fun.-The real world is fine and does the job of acting as the second world, but it's really Barbie land that excels in the feeling of Mattel bringing it to life.The Plot's Originality:
-Yes, much of it is predictable and familiar, but there is more to it than meets the eye
-Barbie's plot is one part comedy, one part discovery, and one part political philosophy that sort of gives you a variety I wasn't expecting.-It may feel a little out there, but points for trying to be different and more advanced than many other stories have attempted.The Acting:
-McKinnon may have been used too much, but I loved her in this film for the way her weirdness works for weird Barbie. Quirky, fun, a little bold, but that SNL line delivery that really works for delivering lines.-Rae is fine for when she is on screen. She's got a few dynamics that her monotone delivery works with what you got, but to get top bill/first bill doesn't make sense to me
-Ryan Gosling works well int eh roles, and for his direction, a supporting actor role nomination feels good for me. He's clumsy, funny, hardcore silly, and it works for the ridiculous nature and tone of the movie.-And for Margot Robbie, the woman continues to knock the ball out of the park for how amazing she fits the role. She's sparkly, quirky, but has a range that she just brings. Gerwig brought some new elements out in terms of representation thought maybe not the Oscar performance like some call for.The Comedy At Times:
-The movie does have general jokes that worked very well for me, well timed moments that were perfect for breaking the moment.-Satire, to a point, was amazing at times at how much fun they had with certain concepts. The design of Barbie dolls that failed, or the fact of fashion drawing eyes, and even certain trends that we love. It was clever, balanced, and had this timing delivery that worked.-Some of the Ken lines were funny, the fact that I was like classic Patrick from SpongeBob was very fun, especially when sometimes paired with one of the other style of jokes.-And Helen Mirren's narration was the funniest component for me. Her dry delivery, the classy sass, and the fact the woman just sells the lines was my favorite part in terms of laughs and wished there had been more.-As such, the comedy did work at times for me.The Pace:
-It's two hours long, but for the most part doesn't feel it and that goes to the fun pacing.-Barbie starts out fun, exciting, and pops into the adventure with a lot of energy.-Then that energy sort of stays, but hunkers down a bit, never losing the whimsy, but finding a means to feel entertaining and somewhat engaging.-That is the superior quality of this movie compared to the other big one, that engaging pace and just having fun.The Music:
-By far, the music is what works the best for me in this movie and tells so much and brings so much energy in the track list.-The songs from the radio and the past work well, comedic devices that were quite honestly some of the best jokes for me with several of the characters.-Other songs are fun musical numbers that work, dance numbers full of pop vibe, or later a true stage show musical that had the theatrics and jazz of a stage show.-As for the new songs that were made for the movie, they were my favorite. Remixes of Barbie girl, an exposition song and reprise, and a few other numbers just have so much character that it really added points for me in terms of just how much fun Barbie can be.The Message:
-There is a very deep message to this movie, and to be honest... I did enjoy this part of Gerwig's writing.-It's deep, has character development and really drives home a lot of social commentary and trends under the microscope about human qualities. I liked how it was built in, and the dialog to embrace it, and just wished this movie had kept that in line with me.DISLIKES:The Fun Vibes Take a Detour:
-I just said the pace was good and there was an energy, but... the fun part did take a detour the further you went into the film.-Gerwig is a very ""unique"" writer and once she got her hooks into her political writing, there were times where the first part of the film's fun was lost to very agenda heavy writing.-I t felt a bit forced for me, and I longed for more numbers, a little adventure, and a little less banter/beating the dead horse that the film went.-Throw in the darker aspects of the agenda, and losing that fun at the beginning was not what I would have liked to see for most of the movie.Gerwig's Hyper Agenda
-I get this is who she is, but I've seen movies where that side of her is toned down and we get a much deeper character drama.-But Barbie... Barbie pulls no punches and berates you with very in your face, no holds bar, rather excessive and in some cases insulting humor that I got tired of.-There were times where that line was perfect and the story quality maximized, but most of the movie failed that balance and she did not seem sorry for what I felt was a tad too toxic for my liking.-If you are a fan of this type of hyper writing, then you are in great shape, but for those like me who are tired of movies becoming agenda venting, this movie is going to lose points for being annoying and simplistic and losing the creative spark.The Stupidity:
-The movie has a smart writer and so seeing so much ridiculous silliness in one movie to contradict the smart writing didn't accomplish much for me.-Will Ferrell's direction was one of these moments where he was a straight up idiot, saying weird things that were more awkward and uncomfortable than funny for me. His little montage was just really dumb and to the point it stuck out a bit too much.-Meanwhile, Ken's handling was fine being a moron, but Gerwig's political writing sort of didn't do much for me as rather than improving and becoming elevated like his counterpart, sort of grew toxic level stupid.-That excessiveness again just doesn't work when I saw those sparkling moments that show where everything comes together, instead of feeling like an adult version of a Disney Channel Original movie.The Character Usage is odd:
-The movie is trying to balance a lot of names and characters and it only works on that half of the time.-Barbie has too many characters, and some of the people I expected to have more time, were limited than I anticipated and quite honestly a political tool.-They do their work, but, it's just missing balance and full use and I think it's relying too much on a sequel and people just happy with being comedic props and line spewers than anything else.The Story Is All Over The Place:
-My fellow reviewers are right, it's a weird story and it is all over the place.-This might give it the unique twist, but Barbie's tale is a jumble of lots of different feels and theatrics that sort of work together, but feel messily put together.-One level is like I said fun, bright, and feels like a dance party meets on stage musical that works to an extent.-The second then becomes this dive into the psyche mixed with somehow comedically stupid gimmicks to try and keep entertaining going
-Third then goes metaphysical and really deep, and it kind of works, but then goes really odd and sort of trippy, to a way I'm still trying to process.-Gerwig's writing is always deeper and more complex, but this might have tried to be a bit too ambitious for its own good for me and felt just so scrambled and very much in your face for plot telling.The VERDICT:
Barbie is a venue that I really did have some fun with and was surprised by the unexpected things it had to offer and the clever writing I had hoped would shine in. A geek like me knowing the references, appreciating the pokes to it, and the fun timing of some well-written lines that had me laughing in the theater. I loved the acting, loved the set, and just loved a lot of the vibes of the less agenda writing really worked for me and will appeal to many of the general group. And the music, whew, really loved it and the energy and storytelling it did which was very good for me. But the movie did not appeal to me in that Gerwig seemed to reach too high for being unique and ""elevated"" leading to moments that just don't appeal to a reviewer like me. The detour of fun for very politically heavy writing was probably my least favorite aspect, losing the killer vibes and balanced fun and humor with a very polarized way of thinking was not my cup of tea. In addition the story elements and character usage felt a bit jumbled, scrambled, shallow, and having too many character moments to really show off Gerwig's better writing. Thus, when balancing this out, my score for this movie is that it's a theater worthy film for a lot of groups and dates. The score is:Adventure/Comedy/Fantasy: 7.5-8.0
Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0."
"Prepare to embark on a mesmerizing journey through the enchanting world of Barbie! This handcrafted ball of serotonin is an absolute delight, leaving your heart brimming with joy from start to finish. Trust me, my cheeks were hurting too, but it was a small price to pay for the unbridled happiness that ensued.In the magical realm of Barbieland, Oscar-worthy set designs work like portals, whisking you away to a realm of imagination and wonder. The chemistry between Margot and Ryan is nothing short of spectacular, radiating an irresistible charm that leaps off the screen and captures your heart.Beyond the surface, the film's plot weaves a tapestry of surprises, defying predictability with cunning twists that keep you guessing throughout. Amid the laughter, ""Barbie"" serves as a brilliant mirror, reflecting upon society's norms, dismantling stereotypes, and fearlessly confronting issues of gender inequality and toxic masculinity. Such clever social commentary adds depth and meaning to this seemingly carefree adventure.As for the comedy, prepare for a sidesplitting experience! Joke after joke lands perfectly, leaving you in stitches and gasping for breath. However, the true comedic gem is none other than Will Ferrel, who delivers a performance that leaves a lasting impression. With impeccable timing and wit, he steals the spotlight in every scene, creating comedic gold that will resonate with audiences of all ages.While the movie does wear the hat of a toy advertisement, it walks the tightrope adeptly. Balancing appeal to the younger audience with engaging entertainment for adults, ""Barbie"" strikes a perfect harmony that caters to both ends of the spectrum.With all the praise deservedly sung, there is only one minor drawback - the movie ends too soon! As the credits roll, you'll find yourself yearning for more of this delightful and captivating experience, a testament to the film's greatness."
"The start was a wonderfully fun look at Barbies & Kens in Barbieland but I felt that it was a bit abrupt when Barbie out of nowhere had thoughts of death would've made more sense for her to notice signs of imperfection first then thoughts of death.Film doesn't hate men I actually really enjoyed how they handled Ken by showing how it is so easy for society to corrupt young teen men with people like Andrew Tate etc. Although ending was bad, why not have Kens and Barbies in charge together as going in the real world showed that men running it was bad & Barbieland was only a utopian for the Barbies. At one point Barbie is asked where do the Kens sleep and she thinks for a moment before saying ""I don't know"" then that's it we never learn, basically her saying ""I don't know and I don't care."" They did so well showing Ken's feelings of being inadequate, inferior and almost like a toy for Barbie to play with when she wanted and yet they just end with the Barbies taking back control of Barbieland, they give Ken's low level government jobs because they should struggle like woman. So, the message is it's okay for one gender to have to fight, claw and struggle for anything good as long as it's men?Also this is entire my own preference and has no fault of story but most of the cast was a bit rubbish for me anyway. It was as if the casting director watched some British shows and picked actors from, like did we really need 3 sex education actors all of which were pretty bland?"
"Making a movie is hard. Super hard. Making one for a huge IP to sell the hell of of merchandise- even harder. But, for approx $150M, this should have been SO much better, in every way.Where it really struggled was with its thin narrative and ACTUAL character development. From a story crafting perspective it's all over the place and spends too much time fighting for cheap laughs (ahem, extra cheap) instead of developing a story around what the human experience is vs. The idea of doll-like perfection. It claws to be profound and existential, but never develops past gender stereotypes. As if GENDER bias was ever the issue with Barbie?! Let's talk about female expectations, expressions, and our evolution!It somehow managed to still feel shallow, which ironically was what the script wanted to subvert. Creating something that's nuanced and not heavy handed takes real craft. This wasn't craft, it was a CASH grab.No go buy all the merchandise, cuz... capitalism!!"
"I have never been a fan of Barbie: I found her too pink, too clichéd - until I watched this film. As the trailer suggested, this movie is for people who hate the legendary doll, so I gave it a shot. It was worth it: I seldom had that much fun in cinema.Barbie lives her happy life in Barbieland, but as she develops a human consciousness, she has to travel to the real world in order to restore normality.This movie is so much more than just funny, as it is political and not predictable. It discusses the influence of the doll on young girls: It criticizes Barbie's stereotypical body while acknowledging her for revolutionizing the way girls saw themselves.""Because Barbie can be anything, girls can be anything"" is said throughout the film. As Barbie taught girls to be more than just mothers, this is true.Margot Robbie has proved what a great actress she is. That makes her the perfect cast for Barbie, as you take her seriously and sympathize with her. Ryan Gosling as her counterpart is equally fitting. He provides the film with a great sense of humor that will leave you laughing out loud.All in all, ""Barbie"" differs from the majority of movies that are produced in Hollywood right now, as it is refreshingly new, funny and surprising. Director and author Greta Gerwig has done a great job creating this hilarious summer movie."
In this film I loved I really like costumes and I really the main them on the film it was very good I thought that film will be for kids and children but it literally isn't it is for adults more than a child Margot Robbie is the perfect actress for the main Barbie but main ken could be a different actor Ryan gosling is ver handsome but he is too old for the main ken role I love the main message of the movie I love Emma in education series but she showed us she can be play in other type of roles and I like the pink theme it's very sweet and cute and last thank you all persons who worked in this film.
"First off, I'm a 60 year-old white male and this movie wasn't even made for me.If your at all interested, then go see this movie. It's funny. It has a lot of funny lines and scenes.The recreation of the set is incredible, but maybe a little vidual indigestion. You adapt quickly.The characters are really good. Perfect for what they are expected to be. Both the main Barbie and Ken are excellently portrayed.There is a feminist overtone, but there is no lack of irony and mockery of both sexes. No one is asking you to be moved or to change your political or other persuasion. Just relax and enjoy it as a comedy.The people who criticize this movie for political or macho reasons are way out of bounds and are too easily swayed by today's political environment. This move is a funny comedy that might actually open your eyes to a feminist point of view of you choose to absorb it. If not, you'll still laugh and call it a good time."
"This is brilliant movie.An entertaining, enlightening and empowering movie.Spoiler- it's about life! About Human beings at their best, worst and everywhere in between.The progression of the story is at a perfect timing of influences, exposure and thoughts for Barbie and Ken. The parallels between the professions of the Barbies and reversals - reflects how we've gone from Mary Richards to ... well you know.Greta Gerwig has taken every facet of the human condition and put a pink glow on it.I laughed, I pondered and I cried. I called my sisters and Mother after the movie and said Thank You."
"Released: 21st July 2023 (UK)Certificate: 12ADirector: Greta GerwigLoved by critics and the average movie goers. Film buffs like my myself will love it or hate it like marmite. Myself I'm gonna put it in my guilty pleasure list of films. I'm so glad Greta Gerwig is becoming recognised as a film director and writer because one of her previous films Lady Bird was outstanding. She is also known for acting in a great horror film Ti West's The House of the Devil and the brilliant Wes Anderson's Isle of Dogs.The film was very entertaining with its hidden adult jokes and how glamorous the world of Barbie is to look at. The soundtrack will become very memorable that will eventually linger with you after the film has ended. Margot Robbie's performance as Barbie is the perfect choice, but for me I think Ryan Gosling as Ken stole the show more for me. Either way I loved them both! I think they both lead the film perfectly. It was great seeing Micheal Cera again after going under the radar for a while. I remember he was becoming a rising up actor in my college years in films like Superbad and Juno. Also it was great seeing Will Ferrell and Kate McKinnon being crazy as ever. I loved the little cameos from John Cena as Mermaid Ken and Rob Brydon as Suger Daddy Ken. Let's not forget Helen Mirren as the sassy narrator. It was really sweet seeing Rhea Perlman again too. She was great in 1996's version of Matilda as the very wacky mother.How fun the film is it does suffer from originality. The idea behind it has been done to death in films like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, The Last Action Hero and Space Jam. Where I said it's like marmite is because there were moments that I felt like it was a bit strong on the political messages and mental health on today's society; if you are looking to watch a film for some escapism where in my opinion that's what the magic of movie experience is all about. Other than that the film is well paced with its decent runtime."
"I don't think I've been this excited about a movie in a long while.It was somewhat different than what I was expecting, but in some fantastic ways. Margot Robbie was a fantastic choice as Barbie. She shines, she makes you fall in LOVE with Barbie again, effervescent in every moment, she fully enveloped how a lot of us remember playing with Barbie, and what we thought and hoped for when we grew up.America Ferrera - fantastic. She brought me to tears
Ryan Gosling was a scene stealer! His Kenergy was phenomenal - in a movie where he was literally ""and Ken""
Greta Gerwig truly brought the entire Barbieland to life.I laughed, I cried , I ugly cried and I'm still revisiting every moment."
"Having just watched a woman drag her tween daughter out of the movie, trailed along a bit after by a couple of older sorts, I can tell you this movie is not what some people have envisioned.It is not a light-hearted children's film. It is PG-13 for a reason and also if you haven't taught your daughter the word ""patriarchy"" yet, that might be something to cover first.Second, it's not a paean to the Barbie doll, Barbie collectors, or Mattel as a corporation. Honestly, I'm not sure how they're signed on as producers except perhaps to prove the point that the corporation is all about a cash grab.(The execs come across as buffoons and their talking points about being there for little girls are definitely shredded in the early encounters. No room to come back.)So while many went into the theater this weekend expecting a fun movie, not everyone will enjoy the show.---I personally thought it was ok--not as grand as expected, but I got to the end well enough.The acting was the fun part, especially Ryan Gosling as the air headed and thwarted Ken--voice of male fragility.Songs are catchy ear worms. The sets are marvelous pop art pink and scaled to make things look doll-like.The plot is a weak point, I'll admit, being very simplistic.Honestly, however, I kind of expected that. (So unlike the women above neither stomped nor snuck out.)Mainly the message is to crush the patriarchy (ok--but where is Allan's role in this patriarchy and why is a pregnant Midge so looked down on, even now?And since the ending sees Mattel theoretically still ramping production, what did we actually learn from this messaging anyhow?)If the pitch was to be a pivot to a modernized Barbie, I'm not sure that marketing campaign did any favors. And if it was that humanism is more important than corporate greed, the associated marketing merch kind of undercut the message, too.At any rate, the directoral easter eggs kept me going through all of it (call back cinematic opening is just the start)
So there's good news and bad news, and maybe it's cost sunk fallacy making me give the film a seven. But I thought it was ""OK,"" so here we are."
"This movie is everything and more. It's comedic, colorful, entertaining, heartfelt, nostalgic, and has such a truly meaningful message that's fit for everyone.While the movie pokes fun at the patriarchy, it's a beautifully written commentary on how the patriarchy affects everyone, not just women. Where Ryan Gosling's Ken was struggling to find who he really is, because the patriarchy forces him into masculinity. There's also the more obvious example of the Barbies being brainwashed into servitude.As marvelously played by Margot Robbie, Barbie feels the struggles that many women face - where we feel lost at some point in our lives. America Ferrera's monologue on how women are always criticized on every detail of their lives was extraordinary. This movie positively shows the beauty of womanhood.Barbie will definitely become a classic and a movie that will be talked about for many years to come!"
"This movie, about Barbie who suffers a crisis that leads her to question her world and her existence, is a good fantasy movie!I liked the concept, and it reminded me of The Toy Story Quadrilogy (1995-2019). The dolls were living dolls, but they were existing in their own reality separated from ours. The sense of humor were present, and I noticed that this movie was targeted for both children and adults in several ways. Its satire was well used, and it was frequently entertaining throughout the runtime. The attention to details was fantastic because of the script, the action, the minor details, like eating and drinking, and last, but not least: the sets and the effects - every visual element, basically. The characters' behaviors were like they were controlled by kids, but we didn't see the kids' hands or like that. They acted like they were played with, and that was well executed, I think.I think the story was alright. The outer story in the first and third act was good. The beginning contained a great representation of the characters and their story while the ending went deep into the inner story about the foundation of Barbie and how Barbie has affected people before, but also how Barbie should affect us in the right way today. It's all about accepting the life with its positivities and negativities, but also to believe in causes and to put yourself in others' shoes, because that's how to live as a realistic, self-controlled being. The second act is a big part of a movie, and I got mixed feelings about that act in this movie. It had its meanings, but I think much of what happened, especially in Los Angeles, was sometimes messy and unnecessary. It was much small-talk, and I sometimes got the feeling that some scenes dragged the time. Anyway, it didn't ruin the overall experience.In conclusion, this movie delivers an imaginative and entertaining story. The attention to detail, from the script to the visual elements, enhances the overall experience. The movie's satirical approach appeals to both children and adults, making it a delightful watch for diverse audiences. While the outer story is well-crafted, the second act could have benefited from tighter pacing. Nevertheless, the movie's exploration of Barbie's impact on people's lives and the themes of acceptance and empathy are commendable. Despite minor flaws, the movie succeeds in captivating its viewers and encourages us to reflect on our own existence and the importance of understanding others."
"The first 30 minutes of ""Barbie"" had me intrigued and entertained. With its colorful world and charming characters,The beginning was fun, light-hearted, and had that nostalgic touch that brought back fond memories.However, as the movie progressed, it took an unexpected turn towards heavy themes of feminine power and patriarchy. While these concepts are important and relevant, they felt out of place in a Barbie movie. The shift in tone became overwhelming and overshadowed the initial enjoyment.I wanted to love this movie, but the burden of tackling such complex ideas seemed misplaced in the Barbie universe. It lost the essence of what makes a Barbie movie special-simple yet heartwarming stories with valuable life lessons. The movie became a bit too preachy and lost its magical charm.In the end, ""Barbie"" had the potential to be a delightful family film, but the weighty themes proved to be too much for a franchise known for its light and cheerful nature. It left me longing for the simple joy and innocent fun that Barbie movies used to bring."
"Let's face it: this film is not supposed to be good. It certainly isn't supposed to offer much more than eye-candy and a few songs. Yet, 'Barbie' in its own way has come to house all the pieces we look for in a movie. For her first live-action story, Greta Gerwig managed to craft an experience that captures everything right, and everything wrong with what the doll has represented to generations of girls. Set design was a dream and at opening feels like the first time we saw Dorothy step into Oz. The cast carried a full load of heavy-hitters and Gosling's Ken made a few attempts to steal the show. Margot Robbie is the true star that shines as she gives much more attention, depth, and charisma than Barbie had any right to be - creating a 3D character that is both whimsical and disturbingly real. Although it is an entirely different think-piece to discuss gender roles, the fact remains that any authentic Barbie story cannot be told without it. Gerwig's real genius is that she is able to tell the story within the story without it feeling like a finger-wag. The fact is, the pacing and humor is more than enough for viewers to see themselves on both sides of the fence. Cunning, sharp, heartfelt, and hilarious, 'Barbie' is an open love letter to past, present, and future mothers and the ties that bind through the obligation of perfection. In the end - like its namesake - the film represents whatever you want it to be. After all, isn't that what she was made for?"
"Barbie may seem like a kids movie at a glance but its more than that. Even though kids are going to love it (no doubt) this movie is specifically made for adults who used to play with the original Barbies. The Barbies that were shown in the movie being exact same as our own childhood dolls takes you back in the past.Margot Robbie's every single action, either crying and laying down on floor or smiling while kissing, is exactly same as a Barbie doll.America Farrera's monologue deserves multiple nominations. She stole the show. Simu Liu was fantastic in it and actually made me sad for Ryan Gosling's Ken.Ken Song is another masterpiece of this movie but it's not as iconic as Will Ferrel calling himself the 'mother' but the best part about the movie was including and remembering Ruth, the founder of Barbie, and her daughter Barbara.The movie broke the wall in unexpected ways, it's classic comedy direct to audience was one of the many great aspects that I loved.Even though I expected a better ending for Ken and other Barbies the movie ended on a happy note which delighted me."
"BARBIE (2023)
Greetings again from the darkness. A reasonable assumption could be made that a movie based on a doll so popular with pre-adolescent girls would be geared towards that audience. However, this is the era of comic book movies targeting ""grown-ups"", and since we know, based on her previous work (the exceptional LADY BIRD, 2017), Greta Gerwig is an intelligent filmmaker, a more reasonable assumption is that she purposefully aimed the movie at women who once played with Barbie dolls and now fill their days with work, family, and adulting. This strategy has proven to be box office gold, and the heavy dose of cosplay at screenings proves the lasting impact this plastic doll has had on many women who lined up for tickets.Ms. Gerwig co-wrote the screenplay with her real-life spouse and fellow filmmaker, Noah Baumbach (MARRIAGE STORY, 2019), and it's fascinating to see what they have produced. Whether you find the film entertaining is another matter altogether, yet we tip our cap to the strange, visually-stimulating, and thought-provoking end result. Many will go in-depth on analyzing the gender politics and feminist approach to the story; however, I'm just here to discuss this as a movie, not a movement.Two-time Oscar nominee Margot Robbie stuns in the opening sequence (a tribute to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY) as the original 1959 Barbie. In fact, Ms. Robbie is terrific throughout in this more-challenging-than-expected role. She's so much more than a pretty face in high heels, as she's previously proven in a risk-taking career featuring memorable turns in such films as THE WOLF OF WALL STREET (2013), SUICIDE SQUAD (2016), I, TONYA (2017), as Sharon Tate in ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD (2019), and last year's underappreciated BABYLON (2022). This time she portrays 'Stereotypical' Barbie, whose everyday is perfect in Barbieland. It's here where we meet a diverse group of Barbies featuring Issa Rae, Alexandra Shipp, Emma Mackey, Sharon Rooney, Dua Lip, and others. We are also introduced to Ken (two-time Oscar nominee Ryan Gosling, terrific here), whose mood for the day is totally dependent on whether Barbie acknowledges him. An equally diverse group of Kens features Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, John Cena, Ncuti Gatwa, and others.Barbie's paradise is rocked one day when she begins wondering about death. A trip to ""Weird Barbie"" (a kooky Kate McKinnon) lets her know that the only cure for this existential crisis is a visit to the human world, where a sad girl is playing with her doll. It's really an imaginative hook to allow the two worlds to collide. Unfortunately, only bits and pieces of the human world clicked for me (loved the rollerblading at Venice Beach). It makes sense that Barbie is shocked to discover the misogyny and patriarchy ruling the human world, but there are three other elements at play here: Ken discovering that men don't take a backseat to women in this world, and in fact, they dominate; the corporate office of Mattel plays like a slapstick cartoon with Will Ferrell as a nonsensical CEO; and the mother-daughter duo of America Ferrera as Gloria and Ariana Greenblat as Sasha. The big twist occurs in that latter sequence, and it's Ms. Ferrera who dishes out the gut punch soliloquy about what's expected of women and how they are viewed. This monologue is the lesson director Gerwig wants viewers to leave with.Barbie's return to a much-changed Barbieland finds Ken and other Kens treating the Dreamhouse like a Frat house. See, the boys have learned how to run things their way ... and at its core, that's my main issue with the movie's theme. Empowering women is a good thing, but why did Ms. Gerwig feel the need to make everything either a win for the women or a win for the men? I have always thought equality was the goal, not dominance. It's this approach that gives the film a serious and dark undertone in a quite heavy-handed manner. Sure women enjoy having power. So do men. That's no great mystery solved, and in fact makes these obvious points somehow more obvious.Let's talk about a few other less ominous topics. Helen Mirren delivers an admirable voiceover as the narrator, and a depressed Barbie and Ken's affinity for horses are nice touches. Two of my favorite segments are Barbie's first interaction in the human world ... a ""beautiful"" woman on a park bench played by Oscar winner Ann Roth (a renowned Costume Designer who did not handle the costumes for this film), and a conversation with Barbie inventor Ruth Handler (played by Rhea Perlman), who named the doll after her daughter. While I hold firm on my belief that the film is not especially entertaining/fun, I'll also admit the song and dance around the ""I'm Just Ken"" number was a hoot. Other than performances from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, the star here is the Production Design from six-time Oscar nominee Sarah Greenwood. The film looks amazing, even if you might get your fill of pink by the end. Barbieland is quite a sight - it's a shame the rest of the movie didn't deliver this much fun, and instead pitted men against women."
"I loved this movie so much. It's so effortlessly funny with the end being heartfelt and quite sad. The soundtrack is amazing including one of my favorite songs by billie eilish ""what was i made for."" The song is so amazing and finishes off the movie in the best way possible.Barbie took a very unexpected turn of events that did not appear in the trailer (i think this is a good thing) and was full of plot twists that thickened the storyline.It is great for all ages and genders as it has a lot of relatable characters.Overall i think it is a movie to definitely add to your watchlist and go see in your nearest cinema!!"
"Barbie turned out to be a bit of a letdown. I had high hopes for the movie, but it didn't quite meet my expectations. The story felt forced, and the narrative lacked a decisive direction. There were moments of humor, but it missed the opportunity to be hilariously entertaining. The film could have been much better if they had taken advantage of the potential for creative and imaginative storytelling that the Barbie franchise offers. Despite the visually appealing scenes, the overall execution left me feeling unsatisfied. I hoped for a more captivating and memorable experience, but unfortunately, it fell short of delivering that. It is good entertainment."
"This was a great movie for the type that it is. Yes, is cheeky / cheesy/ over the top. It's also heart warming, fun, and really original. I loved the way that the movie hit the nail on the head about the complexity of being female, young or old. It truly was a reflection of how so many of us have been made to feel. They also got some laughs over play on words or specific movements made by the actors and actresses because it was just so real and true to the way we all played as children. The casting of MR as Barbie and RG as Ken were such perfect choices. The kids liked it and so did us 30 somethings. Perfect balance of nostalgia and today. Highly recommend it."
"""Barbie"" the movie must be a dream come true for girls all over the world and some guys too if that's your jam.I know my daughter treasured her Barbie collection into adulthood and thought this was in her own words the ""Best Movie Ever""!The film opens with a brilliant parody to Stanley Kubrick's Sci-Fi Epic ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968).Margot Robbie stars as ""Stereotypical Barbie"" and believe me she ain't the only Barbie in this Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy with very adult themes
You will laugh out loud at the clever script from Director Greta Gerwig and co-writer Noah Baumbach.Clearly they have done their research with every Barbie ever made and even some discontinued ones making an appearance, and of course all the accessories sold separately.The only one missing is ""Trixie Mattel"", based on the Drag Queen of the same name.America Ferrera shines like a diamond as ""Gloria"", one of the real humans who makes the journey to mythical Barbie Land after Barbie has an existential crisis and thinks about death.As a grown, smart, sophisticated woman she delivers one of the best soliloquy's ever in a movie.Will Ferrell on the hand as the ""Mattel CEO"" didn't meet the brief.I think the role required someone more grounded who you could believe as they make the transition of discovery to this Fantasy Land where only Barbies, Kens and one Allan exist.While Ryan Gosling is the key ""Ken"" based on Sun Lovin' Malibu Ken (1979), Simu Liu (""Kim's Convenience"", ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"") is one of the many other Ken's that populate this imaginary place of ""Kendom"" where their one and only job is to ""Beach"", but don't mistake them for lifesavers.Rhea Perlman (""Cheers"") has only 2 scenes as someone pivotal in the success of Barbies since 1959.Watch out for: ""Weird Barbie"" (other Barbies call her that behind her back and to her face) suitably played by Kate McKinnon and Michael Cera as ""Allan"". He really does fit into Ken's clothes.Plus the Pink Barbie Corvette and Caravan are stuff you'll want to take home with you.What I loved: The plethora of Barbies (including the deleted ones) and all the various Kens (don't forget John Cena as Merman Ken)
Listen for: Dame Helen Mirren's hilarious narration that breaks the fourth wall.The Production Design is so elaborate that you'll want to explore ""Barbie Land"" in more detail using the pause button when this Big Screen flick moves to BluRay and Streaming.The movie features a contemporary soundtrack that includes a nod to Aqua's ""Barbie Girl"".Unfortunately the Third Act lets down the movie.On the way to its denouement ""Barbie"" turns into ""Barbie the Musical""with more singing and dancing than ""La La Land"" in the ""Beach Off"".""Barbie"" she's everything. He's just Ken.If you're a Barbie Girl in a Barbie World then come on to see ""Barbie"". Wear your best pink outfit, let's go party!"
"Barbie is one of those few films that are able to merge an extremely unreal and borderline bizarre environment with an immensely grounded and hyperreal take on society successfully, and still be massively entertaining.The script is one of the finest in the history of film and demands supreme attention of the audience, not just to the surface level occurrences and dialogues but also to the underlying subtext (paralleling American Psycho).Contrary to the general consensus, this is very much a coming-of-age movie through the eyes of a young girl. Barbie has an idealistic and perfect outlook towards life which gets crushed and she is forced to accept, then gradually embrace and finally manoeuvre through.The film is also vastly political in nature (not just gender but otherwise too), compelling the idealistic society to realise how fractured their own internal workings are resulting in them implementing real life political resolutions to their systems.There are so many more layers to peel off of the writing which elevates this movie from a straightforward comedy/satire to a film that deserves to be broken apart piece by piece and studied extensively for generations to come (sooo very similar to American Psycho).And finally, Ryan Gosling does indeed deliver the absolute most sublime performance of his career."
"Written by Ian Chandler - July 21, 2023MILD spoilers ahead.""Barbie,"" directed by Greta Gerwig, is one of the most bizarre films in recent memory. A popular toy tailored at young girls gets a chance at being one of the year's best films. Its whimsical, funny marketing alongside its promising cast would suggest such. Unfortunately, the film botches that opportunity, but still has some fun moments. Even though it is not as funny as many other comedies, the film manages to stay in one's head after leaving the theater.From its colorful presentation to its glowing characters, Barbie's opening proposes that the movie will be roaringly entertaining. The music is great, the narration pokes fun at the Barbie brand, and the events are overly silly. Margot Robbie does a superb job at capturing the zany but stiff expressions one would expect from Barbie. Accompanying her is the equally funny Ken, who is played by Ryan Gosling. The two are fun to watch and their adventure appears to be one enjoyable time!Despite the promising opening, the film, like cheap plastic, breaks apart very quickly. Once Barbie and Ken go to the real world, the jokes are lazy and subplots are underexplored. The picture's demographic is also confusing. What looked like a kids' film with humor adults can enjoy ends up giving discomforting questions parents have to discuss with their children. (For example, what a penis or a vagina means.) The sporadic sexual humor lacks a proper set up which makes for a lackluster punchline, resulting in cringey moments that, at the moment, raise questions for who this film is tailored for.""Barbie"" also suffers from being a mostly directionless film, as its plot is unfocused but its message is very prominent. It sets up around three plotlines that were likely pitched individually and crams them all into one story with none of these concepts receiving their proper conclusions. It makes for a frustrating ending. The moral is also confusing and seems to spark more of a negative message than a positive one. Instead of the conflicts being resolved where everyone lives in harmony, it is a tug-o-war on which sex has the right to be selfish. It may make some viewers, especially impressionable children, think lower of both sexes or believe their gender is superior or inferior to the other. It may also cause some unnecessary dispute on the internet.How characters grow is another misstep from Gerwig. Many characters do not develop gradually, but abruptly. Barbie, Ken, and two other leading characters are almost unrecognizable to their third-act counterparts. It is difficult to root for any of them as they all aim to achieve their selfish desires instead of coming up with a plan where everyone is happy. If the characters were likable and the overall message was less overboard, it could have matched the quality its marketing advised.Even if it is a bit of a disappointment, there were some laugh-out-loud moments. Fourth-wall breaking jokes were well placed and parodies of other films or events were a joy. The production and music almost make up for the aimless story as it stays true to the brand but also makes the newer ideas feel fresh and organic. The choreography in some sequences is exceptional and, like its presentation, reinstates how fun Barbie and friends can be when it treats itself as a lighthearted comedy. It really could have been great if it were to stay in one direction.Barbie - 65/100
Barbie is a colorful, occasionally brilliant, but misguided comedy."
"This film thinks it's the Lego Movie but is far more akin to Don't Worry Darling. Starting off in a Matriarchal society, '60s feminist paradise where every position in society is ran by women (this is never shown as oppressive or questionable) saturated with the neon pinks and pastel purples, quintessentially American and girly. All Kens are sidelined and have no meaning they are jealous of one another and simp over Barbie. Through the course of the film this paradigm is spun on its head and put back to how it was again, no fantastical change happens to this world once it is changed and fought over and won back again by the Barbies.Vapid and confused are just a few words to sum up this movie. Misandrist should be just as common as misogynist in today's vocabulary; if any film of this generation portrayed women as servile, useless, and toxic it would be slammed across the board. However in this film woman are both victorious and the victim; the oppressed and oppressor; the can-haves and the cannots. Barbie wants its pink empowered cake and wants to eat it too.I didn't expect a pro masculine message from a Barbie movie, but I also didn't expect this when asked to accompany my girlfriend. I would also never expect any woman to sit through a film that took swings and berated their gender. Is this movie harmful? Yes, a generation will be brought up to hate their fathers, brothers, and even sons. This burns bridges rather than mends them or creates new ones. It feels like a trojan horse when compared to its advertising.Many will tell you it has brains, is well written and is a fascinating commentary on society -some of that may be true. Though if truth be told it is a confused and confusing film. A feminist utopia would have women in every possible position in society, and shocked to see there were construction barbies however that no building had exterior walls or any use of windows... I don't know what this says, but the optics don't look well. The fantasy land portrayed is truly fantasy and I hope every viewer realises that."
"This was the Barbie movie I hoped for. First adverts made it appear like Barbie would be sexualized.But, that is far from the reality of what this art is.Perspective: I LOVEDBarbie growing up. I was not a dress wearing, sparkle loving, 'stereotypical little girl of the 80'sThe movie The is warm but written for women and for love of women-I cried watching it but as a woman of an age who relates-deeply to the writing of this and story line in many ways if not all.This is silly but not campy, casting spot on. Margot and Gosling superbAlso, c'mon Simu (mega hearts)Not written for little kids, but necessarily and wonderfully written and made."
"Going into Barbie with having little to no expectations at all can be such a delight.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling's banter with one another, even when they are on their own, are so entertaining to look at, especially Gosling who seems to have a more fun in the movie and is indeed the funniest out of all the cast members.That being said, everyone in the cast seem to be having fun in their own respective roles, living out Barbieland and the real world. But by far the standout would have to Kate McKinnon (Ghostbusters) and America Ferrera (How To Train Your Dragon), who both help Robbie's titular character when she is having an existential crisis.As for the production design, it is without a doubt, the strongest aspect of the film, particularly in BarbieLand where it seemed like the production team really went all-out in making the world, not to mention how they really feel when young girls are playing with Barbie.The film does carry a lot of themes of not just someone trying to overcome an identity loss but also how acceptance should start by loving yourself and not needing to live up to the norms set up by leaders.They are thought-provoking including capitalist feminism (how ideas can make money instead of enjoyment), alongside the idea of growing up which is coming to terms with reality and letting go of the childhood you have cherished - which is well-represented in the fantasy and real world.All the way through, as a comedy, even though some jokes did not land well, most of it are really funny and does put a smile on your face up until the very end.Overall, Barbie continues to prove the amazing directing skills of Greta Gerwig (Little Women, Lady Bird) and alongside her writing craft with her husband Noah Baumbach. With this film alongside Oppenheimer, it is one of the standout films of 2023."
"Barbie is agonizingly close to being a masterpiece. Imagine your run of the mill 2020s high budget film. Now let's go through it with a fine comb and add a bunch of brilliant tiny details to the first two acts, but then let's have a third act that fits the modern trend of overstaying its welcome and failing to provide satisfactory answers to its own questions and lacks all those fun little bits that made you love the first two thirds of the movie.Without spoiling plot, Barbie much like Game of Thrones and Hunger Games hints at complex understanding of social and political issues but ultimately settles on the safest most vanilla possible answers to those problems. It also, in modern fashion, wastes time going off on tangents.I feel, much like Margot Robbie, pulled in two directions. A part of me wants to praise the film for shedding on light on feminist issues while another wishes to tear it to shreds for copping out in the end.The further one gets into Barbie, the less its complexities feel like they are there to make a point, and the more it feels they are there to fill time.If you're like me you'll leave in a disappointed but forgiving mood. Even if the ending fumbles what was set up, I can't forget my enjoyment of the setting up itself."
"Ever since I saw Lady Bird, I knew that I will love Greta and her style. It was so human and it spoke to me. So when Barbie was released, there was no doubt I will like this film-but not this much. In 114 minutes, Greta serves everything that she intended sending a beautiful positive message about womanhood. What it means to be human, what it means to live in this broken patriarchal system. The message is clear: to be human is to feel. This movie is funny. And as someone who is not a fan of American humor, that's a big one. But I laughed through the entire movie. I also shared a tear. I loved America's monologue about womanhood. I loved Dame Helen Mirren as a narrator-great choice. Margot is a star. Her Barbie is so authentic. She portrays comedy, as well as the emotional part of the character so well. That last scene was so good. Now I can't skip the star of the film, and that is Ryan Gossling. Ken was hilarious and I will quote him for the rest of my life. But also shows that Greta is sweet to men offering them compassion by showing them that they are enough as it is, they don't have to be more than that. Greta (and Noah), really made a beautiful love letter to womanhood by showing all the parts of it-please the scene with the old lady had my heart. Overall it's already classic and the movie, that will probably be one of my comfort movies."
"I am so torn, on this movie. There is no doubt, that Barbie is beautifully made movie, with an awesome cast and an amazing creative team. Margo Robbie was born to play Barbie and lets be honest Ryan Gosling stole the entire movie. Then again I can't think of a single cast Member I didn't like. The references are amazing, as a boy with a sister, I grew with Barbie so I recognised a lot things. But, I did not care for the writing and some of the movies messages, were not just bad, but problematic. I was going to go into details about all the things that bothered me, but I'm not spoiling anything. I don't hate this movie, by any means, but I don't love it either. I think the target audience will love it, and lets be honest thats not me."
"This movie was an aesthetic dream . Just looking at it was a treat . Scene to scene , color schemes , outfit choices . This kept you drawn in and you wanted to keep looking - even if you didn't like anything else - the straight up visual was worth it .The satire and political commentary was absolutely on point . This movie didn't try to hide what it was or what it was doing - it showed you trailer to finish and I loved that . There was nothing put in by accident - everything was thoughtful and served a purpose . This was true for every joke , every clothing choice , every character , every emotion ,The humor was funny - but this was my one complaint . I don't like crude humor and I am a prude and honestly some of it was crass . Nothing ""bad"" and I recognize I am a grinch in that way - I laughed but this was the reason I would not watch it over and over , just don't value that type of joke . But I recognize and respect the writing and it was very important to the movie .The casting and acting - INCREDIBLE! I mean really - every single person was better than the next . Margot Robbie was absolutely incredible . Every single supporting cast member was so well casted and acted . America Ferrara was amazing and her monologue was probably the highlight of the film and the most powerful part - every woman ( every person ) can relate in some way if not all ways .Hats off to Greta for this film - she took and assignment and got an A+ and then earned some extra credit - one of the great directors .Great film - and I respect it so much as a film - doesn't mean I have to love watching it ( that's what for me makes it an 8 instead of a 10, but honestly it probably deserves an 11)IGo see it - it's absolutely worth it."
"I went to this movie just to see the eye candy of beautiful people and fanciful sets because, come on, who is more perfectly beautiful to portray Barbie than Margot Robbie? And who's more attractive to be Ken other than Ryan Gosling?This movie was too long, too wordy and too preachy to be for actual children. Which is odd since it's about the most iconic doll of all time.The creation of the Barbie world was awesome: sets and props. But the preachy and messy plot about the patriarchy didn't impress, and neither did the resolution of the story. How about promoting a world where neither men nor women have to have the majority of the power over each other? Some of the dialogue in this movie was literally incoherent babble. Also, they didn't have to pointedly throw in that Barbie was drinking cow milk- cow on the label in all caps. Are the writers anti vegan? At least they mentioned in the film to the audience that Ken was wearing faux fur, but it was like a condescending little note because I guess they assume people care more about fur industry animals than they do about the masses of exploited cows. Anyways, the best parts of this movie were: Ryan Gosling all the way (gorgeous, funny, singing and dancing,) the conflict between the two alpha Kens and introducing me to Simu Liu and Issa Rae. Despite its flaws, I'm glad I followed the hype and saw this movie. But I doubt I could sit through it again, it's just too silly and canned preachy."
"A fantastic satirical drama on patriarchy blended with witty humor, fabulous direction, and fabulous acting.It can be many things, but not a kids' film or gender-specific film.Greta takes us into fantasy barbieland with the deep concepts of consumerism, patriarcy, physical insecurity, and self-discovery cleverly layered under it.Conveys all these in a satirical and humorous way subtly and beautifully.I loved how it shows both extremes of patriarchy of men and also women.The sets, visuals, music, and costumes were just so amazing sets the whole vibe.Ken and Barbie had such awesome chemistry and genreated great humor on the screen.I was so excited to see margot robbie & emma mackey together in the film. And they were fantastic. All the others were beautiful, both in looks and acting.There are some really good one-liner and monologues which are funny & make you think at the same time.I felt good hearing about the response for Barbie, considering the talk around baribie being a silly film for only kids or gender s0ecific. But it's much more than that.So, indians, after watching the hyped up oppenheimer, watch Barbie too, and you won't be disappointed."
"The first Barbie fashion doll was released by Mattel in 1954, there have been several straight-to-DVD computer-animated cartoons, but it has taken 64 for a live-action movie to be made. This was one of the most hyped-up movies of the year, I certainly couldn't ignore it, directed by Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird, Little Women). Basically, the film opens with the Narrator (Dame Helen Mirren) explaining the history of dolls before the introduction of Barbie (a parody of 2001: A Space Odyssey) and how Barbie came to change the world. Barbieland is a matriarchal society where all ranges of living Barbie and Ken dolls reside. All the women are self-confident, self-sufficient, and successful, while the men spend their days engaging in recreational activities at the beach. All Barbies hold all important job positions such as doctors, lawyers, journalists, pilots, astronauts, and politicians. ""Stereotypical"" Barbie (Margot Robbie) lives her best life all day every day, while her on-off boyfriend Ken (Ryan Gosling) is only happy when he is with her, and she shows him some attention. Ken seeks a closer relationship, but Barbie rebuffs him to be independent and continue her female friendships. Barbie holds one of her regular parties at her Dreamhouse, which momentarily halts when she asks a question about mortality. The following day, Barbie finds her regular routine has altered, her raised feet have gone flat and she has cellulite. Her friends, including Writer Barbie (Alexandra Shipp), Physicist Barbie (Emma Mackey) and Lawyer Barbie (Sharon Rooney) tell her to visit Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a wise but disfigured outcast who was played with badly, giving her permanent splits and felt-tip pen drawn on her face. Weird Barbie tells her to cure her affliction, she must go to the real world and find the child playing with her. Weird Barbie does offer her the option to take her heal shoe and everything will return to normal but really wants her to take the second option (a parody of The Matrix). Driving her pink convertible outside of Barbieland, Barbie finds Ken stowed away, he insists he is coming with her, and she reluctantly agrees. Barbie and Ken travel by car, by boat, by rocket, by bicycle, by campervan, and by snowmobile (all deliberate cut-out scenarios), until they arrive at Venice Beach, Los Angeles, California. The two cause a stir while exploring, including with their colourful roller-skating gear and blades, then changing into cowboy outfits. At toy manufacturer Mattel, the creators of Barbie, the all-male board members are informed that Barbie has entered the real world. The CEO (Will Ferrell) orders her to be captured and brought to them to be put back in her box. At the local school, Barbie encounters a tween girl named Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) who criticises Barbie dolls for encouraging unrealistic beauty standards and attitudes about women. Meanwhile, Ken explores the city and learns about the patriarchal system, mistakenly believing it was all started by men and horses. It is through simple interactions with people that he feels respected and accepted for the first time; with everything he has learned he returns to Barbieland. Feeling distraught by Sasha's comments, Barbie soon meets Sasha's mother Gloria (Ugly Betty's America Ferrera), a Mattel employee, who is the person who was playing with her. Gloria is the catalyst of her existential crisis; she was playing with Sasha's old Barbie toys while experiencing her own identity crisis, inadvertently transferring her concerns to Barbie. Soon, Mattel agents arrive and take Barbie to headquarters. They attempt to put Barbie in a toy box for remanufacturing, but she escapes with Gloria and Sasha's help. During the pursuit, Barbie enters a room containing a 1950s home scenario and encounters an elderly lady (Rhea Perlman) who recognises her. Returning to Barbieland, they discover that it has changed dramatically. The Kens have taken over, while Barbies have been reduced to submissive roles, such as maids, housewives, and agreeable girlfriends. Barbie tries to convince Ken and the Barbies to return to the way things were, only to be rebuffed. Barbie becomes depressed and returns to Weird Barbie and her group of discontinued dolls. Gloria gives an inspirational speech about society's conflicting expectations of women, and Barbie's self-confidence is restored. Meanwhile, the CEO and board members are making their way to Barbieland. With the assistance of Sasha, Weird Barbie, Ken's friend Allan (Michael Cera), a lone and discontinued character, and other discontinued dolls, Gloria repeats her moving words to all Barbies to snap them out of their subordinate behaviours. Ken intends to cement the changes to Barbieland and create male superiority by changing the constitution, allowing men to become President and replace all other roles taken by the women. The restored Barbies manipulate the Kens to fight against each other to distract them from the alterations. The Barbies regain their positions of power but also realise the errors of Barbieland's previous societal system. They decide to make changes, including better treatment for the Kens and all outcast dolls. Barbie and Ken apologise to each other and acknowledge their failings. Ken feels that he has no identity or purpose without Barbie, she encourages him to find himself. Barbie remains unsure of her own purpose and identity. She suddenly finds herself in a heavenly place where she encounters the elderly lady again, revealing herself to be the spirit of Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler. Ruth explains that she created Barbie as a toy that represented what girls ""wanted to be""; she named ""Barbie"" after her daughter Barbara. After a montage of home footage of young girls playing, Ruth explains that Barbie's story has no set ending. After the Barbies, Kens, and Mattel executives bid Barbie goodbye, she decides to become human and return to the real world. Sometime later, Gloria, her husband (Ryan Piers Williams), and Sasha take Barbie, now going by the name ""Barbara Handler"", to a building for an appointment, and she enters asking to see her gynaecologist. Also starring Issa Rae as President Barbie, Hari Nef as Dr. Barbie, Shang-Chi's Simu Liu as Tourist Ken, Kingsley Ben-Adir as Basketball Ken, Sex Education's Ncuti Gatwa as Artist Ken, Jamie Demetriou as Mattel CFO, Scott Evans as Stereotypical Ken, Ana Cruz Kayne as Judge Barbie, Ritu Arya as Journalist Barbie, Derry Girls' Nicola Coughlan as Diplomat Barbie, Dua Lipa as the Mermaid Barbies, John Cena as Ken Merman, Asim Chaudhry as Warehouse Employee, Ray Fearon as Dan at the FBI, Erica Ford as Skipper, Emerald Fennell as Midge, Lucy Boynton as Proust Barbie, Rob Brydon as Sugar Daddy Ken, and costume designer Ann Roth as the Woman on the Bench. Robbie is gorgeous and perfectly cast as the loveable ""stereotypical"" Barbie going on an adventure, Gosling as the muscly, foolish, attention-seeking Ken is splendid, McKinnon is hilarious as the mangled Weird Barbie, Ferrera is good support, Ferrell is amusing, many other supporting cast members and the cameo performers are terrific, and the voice of Mirren (occasionally breaking the fourth wall) is great. Gerwig and her co-writer/real-life partner Noah Baumbach (Frances Ha, Marriage Story) were given full creative freedom for the script. They are unafraid to poke fun at the Barbie world, including many references to discontinued lines and how kids play with the toys, and interesting ideas of feminism, body image, female empowerment, the battle of the sexes, and the human experience. The visuals are sugar-coated and saturated with colour, pink obviously most prominent, with impressive set and costume design, and the soundtrack of catchy pop songs (""Pink"" by Lizzo, ""Dance the Night"" by Dua Lipa) (the original ""Barbie Girl"" by Aqua does not feature?!, there is the new version by Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice with Aqua) and fun song and dance routines. It could have been a conventional girly Barbie film with a dull love story or something and a happy ending, but it goes the other direction and benefits completely with its deliberately surreal and cheesy approach, a bonkers but inventive and worthwhile fantasy comedy. Very good!"
"I think i laughed maybe twice. Michael cera was probably the best thing in the movie and he wasnt that funny here. Nothing made sense, there was a really random depiction of what i think was supposedly to be a stereotypical man but it was like a weird distorted version like a fever dream, just really off but just barely accurate enough to catch. I think it was supposed to be comedic. There was a random like half hour where they pretended only women have certain problems and that somehow realizing that broke the girls from a spell that men had put on them by acting in that feverish dream version of ""manly"". Overall it was just super weird and not that funny."
"BarbieDazzling, heartfelt and brilliantly funny. Comedy of the year, movie of the summer!Barbie is a beautiful blend of comedy and heart. Aided deftly by colourful visuals, Greta Gerwig tells the story of a doll coming to life, with as much intellect and emotion that's needed.Barbie is unabashedly feminist, will ruffle some feathers (as it should), and will delight even more people. Themes of existentialism, individualism and masculinity are also dealt with.Despite being a product of Mattel, Greta found a way to critique the parent company (although it's funny that the product that mocks the maker ends up raking in more money for the maker).Margot Robbie is Barbie! She was an agreeable canvas, and she allowed Greta Gerwig to paint a very nuanced portrayal of Barbie. Ryan Gosling turns out a career-best performance in Barbie, stealing and shining in all of his scenes. The supporting cast also gives great performances.The soundtrack was fitting, guiding the movie down to the finish line with Billie Eilish's 'What was I made for' delivering a wonderful culmination. The set design and costumes were brilliant too.The lore of Barbie spans over six decades, so compressing it all into one movie was a definite challenge, but Greta was able to bring the most important things (including Easter eggs and fan service) to the movie.Barbie does have its failings, and the most noticeable is the plot. The first half is very intriguing, quirky and pays homage to other movies, but the second half isn't as tight.Barbie isn't perfect but it's a beautiful dose of everything good.8/10."
"The movie is great. Everyone says it's very preachy but I actually think the societal expose is done in a very tasteful manner. It makes you think about the world we live in and points out ridiculous things that have always been there but we never paid attention to - for example, why most cash has famous men on them, and not one woman (with some exceptions around the world, of course). It also presents Ken the way women have been portrayed in movies since the beginning of the movie industry - clingy, confused, a bit inadequate, annoying, etc.It's smart, it's very funny, it's interesting and it deserves the hype."
"Ryan Gosling acting was so good that is seemed that he as Ken is the main character.Physically Margot was a great choice, but she didn't give much. Even when she had the opportunity to act more human, her expressions and acting were still more as a doll, and Ryan did a better job.I didn't know what to expect but I was hoping that it will not be too superficial, and it wasn't. The movie is light, with some smart things said. It was a bit too long and became little boring in the middle but after all it was fun to watch. Loved the music, costumes, choreography. Girls can relate to many things said in the movie, and I recommend you to watch it in girls company, you will have fun."
"Normally when a movie is hyped up big time you can pretty much guarantee it's gonna be rubbish.Honestly this is literally just what the world needed. But do you know what? If you didn't like it then fine! Maybe it was just what I needed!I'm not a cheesy fan in films but this did it so right. Honestly I was laughing so hard then nearly crying the next. It was a rollercoaster of a ride that I didn't know I needed in my life. I came out there thinking it was brilliant what I didn't expect was me driving home trying to stop myself from crying. I know it sounds dramatic but if you got it, you know.Ryan gosling I knew he was a great actor but my god he took up a whole other comedic value and wasn't embarrassed in doing so! He was pure perfection in the role of Ken.Obvs Margot Robbie. No words needed.I loved the script. I loved the direction, I loved all the actors involved.Honestly just pure barbie perfection. Chefs kiss.Let me go off and drink wine and now go cry."
"Barbie vs Oppenheimer, was an amazing event to take place, if you want to say they were even going against each other, it was very enjoyable to see this take place though.But as for Barbie the movie was okay in my opinion, it was no doubt hilarious and joyful, I would probably rewatch it for that reason. But the movie itself just kind of lacked something, I think the story was okay, had some good messages. Some parts just didn't work well, the storyline of the daughter didn't make sense, because one scene she's mean and terrible then all of the sudden she's nice, just didn't work that well.But overall it was just okay, probably won't watch it again."
"I honestly thought I have to see what the hype was all about but I'd go when the buzz has dies down but after not being able to get the ""I'm just Ken"" song out of my head for a couple of weeks I gave in and I'm glad I did...I really enjoyed it! This movie isn't just aimed at kids in fact I would say it was definitely more for adults funny enough. Ryan stole the performance for me as Ken I looked more forward to his scenes then anything else. He captured so much in his looks and expressions that he totally steals the show and barbie actually felt secondary to me which is ironic as Ken always felt second. It could have been named Ken actually I loved knowing more about him then Barbie. Margot Robbie was beautiful and definitely captured Barbie she is stunning. Will Farrel plays the same character I feel though I love him but anyone could have played his role as boss of Mattel. I would watch it again for sure and I would actually love it if ""I'm just Ken"" wins best song at the Oscars and Ryan gets to sing it. Overall I can't find much wrong with it my only complaint is the real world I found a little bit boring I much preferred the dreamworld. Also the Alan character was great I wish we saw more of him. I definitely highly recommend this movie it's an enjoyable watch and a great pick me up smile on face movie."
"Barbie Movie Review
She's a Barbie girl (who is having an existential crisis) in the Barbie world. Life isn't so fantastic. So she decides to head to the 'real world' with Ken because we've got everything sorted over here right?The film highlights the paradox that is Barbie... and owns it. It would seem that they wrote a pros and cons list and tackled every item on it. Was Barbie an astronaut before women were allowed credit cards? Yes. Has she perpetuated unachievable body image stereotypes? Yes. Do they address both of these issues and everything in between - 100%. Even Mattel, the makers of Barbie and this film, aren't safe, poking fun at their own lack of diversity hiring.The experience feels very intimate, getting up close with Margot Robbie. From the literal extreme close ups to the emotion she manages to give when bringing a kids toy to life. Robbie commits to the role but never comes across as ditzy or dumb, growing more with every scene.However Ryan Gosling doesn't shift out of cheeseball mode but clearly relishes the chance to ham it up as a Himbo.The narration from Helen Mirren, although brief, is one of the highlights. Punctuating moments with her dry British wit.The message of inequality is prevalent in every line of this film and although it's an extremely important message, it could have been done without bashing you over the head with it for 2 hours.Mums and Dads will love the nostalgia and the occasional double entendre. Girls and boys will have fun while hopefully absorbing her (not so subtle) message.By Nick

"I got into the theater with zero expectations, and I can only say I was very positively surprised.I loved the comedy in this movie as I think I haven't had that much fun in a while. And the other thing I love about this is that because the movie is a goofy comedy, you don't have to take the everything too seriously and you just go with it, and you enjoy the comedic ride all the way through the movie.On the other hand, the movie also provides a lot of criticism towards the many flaws in our society and all through the movie you find things, that reflect that, and I believe they are portrayed perfectly.Without spoiling to much I would recommend the movie to anyone as on the one hand I think it produces a lot of important messages and on the other I can't think of anyone who wouldn't enjoy the comedic experience."
"This review will sorta just be a barebones review. There's no spoilers because this movie doesn't really have a plot or resolution that can be spoiled. The movie starts out with a reference from 2001: a space odyssey, Which im sure went right over the target audiences heads. Then breaks into a lot of corny jokes in Barbieland. Barbieland is the best part of the movie, the Barbies performances are all hammed up, kind of like a long progressive commercial. But the acting is supposed to be corny and overacted because they're barbies so I'll accept it. Barbieland has a lot of fun moments with the songs and dances and the beach and Cena. The design of Barbieland and costumes of the Barbies and Kens is why this movie is getting this hype ans it definitely lives up to it. Margot Robbie does a good job as barbie and Gosling as Ken is by far the funniest/best part of the movie. Barbie starts her crisis and goes to the real world and everything starts to suck. Ken finding out about patriarchy is the best thing about the real w orld. The jokes in this movie were really weak, the sentimental serious parts are really boring, this movie feels like it's 2 and 1/2 hours and it's only 1h45. Will Ferrell shows up but they forgot to write jokes for him. America Ferrera gives the most genuine performance but her character is devoid of logic and ends up just giving a long lecture. Lots of the corny jokes in this movie fall completely flat, but theres so many jokes in this movie that you will laugh at least a little bit. Men are targeted in this movie and it has no idea what subtlety is, but it is a Barbie movie so i can accept that. And most importantly this movie has no conflict resolution at all, they sorta just end the movie on one last moderately silly joke. This movie was sort of just a forgettable comedy with a lot of hype before it. But hey I'm glad it brought people to theaters again and did have a message worth watching even if it was delivered rather weakly.6.2/10."
"In one sense, this film was more inevitable than Thanos. What do you get when you're part of a society that fuels existential crises, by constantly eroding definitions and structures? Barbie and Ken aren't exactly human (they don't even have genitals); they're embodied ideas, and so they face this amorphous crisis of identity that pits their presuppositional views of a happy society against that of the ""real world."" But their perception of the real world is like seeing a plane for the first time and therefore thinking it's a dragon. So how much can an audience glean from the pontifications of characters who are essentially children? I would have greatly preferred scriptwriters more well-versed in sociology as well as comedy, writers who understand not only American ideals, and how those ideals have shifted, but the role that Barbie has played along the way. I get the sense that the writers here just KNOW Barbie had some impact, without really understanding much beyond that. There was so much to explore, and it could have been shown situationally, rather than through heavy-handed exposition.Off-screen, apparently Ken had some interesting realizations about his misunderstandings of patriarchy, and Barbie had some realizations about how she treated Ken, but we don't get to see any of this nuance actually played out. Hugely missed opportunities there.Bottom line: As fantastic as Robbie and Gosling were, I wish this movie just didn't exist. Keep the cast, but try again with a much better script and director."
"This is the first time I've written a review for a movie, that should tell you that I enjoyed this movie an awful lot.The storyline grabbed my attention at every corner and the soundtrack continues to ring in my ears and evoke a feeling of confidence in myself and pure joy. It really focused in on it's female audience and was able to accurately portray the modern day plight of the average woman. I didn't expect to cry during this movie but I had never felt so understood and empowered to be myself.Margot Robbie was Barbie, she managed to uphold the whimsy and joy of Barbie throughout the tough political statements that with any other actress would have depressed the audience. Ryan Gosling never failed to make me laugh in his role as Ken, he was perfect for this role and I can't imagine anyone else fulfilling it to the same standard. The supporting Barbies and Kens also excelled in their roles adding to the character and world of Barbie.I have spent some time reading other reviews which have complained that the 3rd portion of the movie was too heavy handed in its feminist perspective and that its blunt political message didn't properly encapsulate Barbie. To that I say; The 3rd portion is less than 40 minutes long, if you can't listen to women's issues for that little time without getting bored then maybe you're not getting what we're saying. And this movie was actually about Barbie, unlike the animated Barbie movies which merely starred Barbie. This movie is actually about Barbie and her extensive history as a controversial doll that had to fight tooth and nail to make it into the hands of little girls and inspire them to be more than mothers.Overall, Barbie was incredible and I hope she inspires even more little girls through this movie than she already has."
"No movie I've seen lately has made me feel this happy. I went to the theater thinking I was going to see an ordinary romantic comedy, but as I watched the movie I started to think about what popular culture has done to people. The costumes are exquisite. The location designs are incredible. Makeup and jewelry design is perfect. And the acting is so natural that it draws you into the movie. A movie for the summer months. You feel incredibly happy when you leave the movie and go home. You are in a fairy tale world but you are facing the harshest realities of the world. I thank everyone who contributed. I hope that the interest in the movie will not lead to a repeat of the mistakes that have been made many times before and a second Barbie movie will not be made."
"Being a boy growing up I was never a ""Barbie"" doll collector, always had mostly ""Star Wars"", ""WWF"", and ""He Man"" figures, yet I like all others knew the impact and cultural historical vibe of the Mattel toy line. This film from director Greta Gerwig which blends the toy and real worlds together, so well showing what it's like to deal with being accepted into reality with people who have loved you as a toy doll. The movie rightfully called ""Barbie"" is a fun one a real sentimental journey a film really of escape, fantasy, a touching adventure that's blended with comedy and drama. The acting and on screen chemistry is in top notch form with ""Barbie""(the beautiful and sexy attractive Margot Robbie) and ""Ken""(Ryan Gosling) as they live in the colorful and magical playland life it all seems just a dream, only when signs of malfunction and a hint that ""Barbie"" might be human the film changes. As going into the real world to search for the cure to become a toy again offers plenty of moments that have you as a viewer laughing and feeling emotions as you really along, with the central character feel the compare and contrast and weigh the choices and decisions that humans must make, and the real world even sees the ""Barbie"" toys in a different light. Overall well done good feel good entertaining film as the sets and displays of pink give escape and fun, even if you were not a ""Barbie"" collector you will enjoy this film as it provides the messages of love and acceptance."
"I'm a dude so take what I'm saying with a grain of salt.When I saw it for the first time, I really enjoyed it, but it was a lot to take in. I've heard talks about this movie for YEARS, and it was different than I expected. I could recognize the performances were amazing and Greg blew it out of the park with the directing and writing and I had so much fun. But all I saw was a ""fun"" movie about ""being a women?""...HOWEVER, after I left, I couldn't stop thinking about it. Now that I knew the plot I felt I had to watch again to really understand what the movie was saying. So I watched it AGAIN, and I never go to the movies twice! I was BLOWN AWAY. Not only did I see so many details about the Barbie world but got a grasp of what Greta was saying about society l. About women. Men. Corporations. Mothers. Daughters. War.Do your self a favor. Watch it! Then, watch it again! Tbh I'm probably gonna see it one more time. I've only touched the surface."
"This probably wouldn't come off as a shocker to anyone who knows me, but I'm definitely not the target audience for this film. That doesn't mean I dislike the film in anyway, just thought that would be an important thing to point out before actually reviewing this film.Surprisingly the movie wasn't generic or filled with over-the-top cliches, and judging from the trailer, I thought I'd have seen this story play out so many times before. I mainly expected it to depend on its humor, which is probably the only thing that lived up to my expectations because I'm a way it kind of did. It actually had a compelling message that had decent pacing to lead up to that message (obviously the message wasn't directed towards me in any way, but to young girls who struggle with these issues, that's not to say the message is bad or anything, I just can't say much about a message that's not even directed towards me).Without Ryan Gosling, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed this film as much as I did. I'm definitely not saying the other actors were completely horrible in there role, because it's quite the opposite, I just don't think it would've lived up to Gosling's performance to me. I like Margot Robbie as an actress, and I think she does a great job for this role. And for the most part a lot of the actors here were great too of course.If I had to come up with one negative for this film, maybe the gender roles thing was a little preachy, but honestly it doesn't bother me nearly as much as most films handle this subject. I've seen how completely woke certain films can be, and it's not nearly as bad as the way this film handles it so I can't really be too upset about it. Other than that, this is a film you can't really take seriously because it's a comedy. All I can say is this movie was fine, but definitely not for me, and that's ok."
"Barbie was honestly a pleasant surprise, I went as a joke thinking it would be stupid but ended up loving the movie. The acting and humour were perfect and everything was so well done. The storyline was incredibly good for a movie about dolls and I am honestly impressed. The soundtrack was great and the songs sung were even better. The effects and sets were perfect for the theme and plot and it just worked so well. I absolutely loved it and hope it does well at the box office because it deserves so many awards. Margot Robbie, great. Ryan Gosling, amazing. Michael Cera, better than ever. Will ferrel, yes! John Cena, best character. Great movie everyone should watch!!!"
"Consistently entertaining, imaginative, and occasionally wickedly funny, Greta Gerwig helms an audaciously original take on the iconic doll, fashioning a pastel wonderland with deeper, albeit crudely pushed, morals and ideas. Margot Robbie stars as Barbie, the stereotypical perfect doll whose carefree existence in the utopian Barbieland is one day disrupted, leading her eventually into the real world, accompanied by the hapless Ken, played by Ryan Gosling in a valiant attempt to drag character from caricature.Baumbach and Gerwig's script is loaded with references and nods to many aspects of pop culture, pulling them off pretty successfully with the aid of Gerwig's direction, which matches the tone of the script perfectly, at turns breathlessly light and then scathingly precise.The production design team in particular clearly got much of the funding, with lush and detailed sets, picture-perfect outfits, and enough pink to cause a temporary world shortage of the colour. Robbie in particular does a fabulous job of capturing the subtleties of inner struggles behind a perfect facade, and it is on her character that the movie finds its feet and produces sparks of deeper emotion. Gosling, meanwhile, delivers some of the best comedic timing and lines of the movie, and does his best to convince us that the script did not severely underwrite his role, or in fact the roles of everyone save the idea of womanhood.For a movie which purports to deliver a nuanced take on the influence of Barbie and the implications of its commercial success in a world admittedly mostly governed by men, parts of the script come off as overly preachy and about as subtle as the amount of pink in this movie. This does detract from the entertainment factor, especially with the mild stakes and average pacing, meaning that when you're looking at it, it's nice to look at, but you could easily not be looking at it either.Many of the ideas introduced are thought-provoking and interesting in the context of the meaning of humanity, especially in the first two acts. In the third, much of those ideas get resolved far too easily, and on a couple occasions, in a manner which undercuts the message of equality it purports to show.There are some standout moments, especially a ridiculously funny and entertaining sequence featuring Gosling's Ken towards the end, and one or two impactful, quiet moments where Robbie and Gerwig gel together perfectly, but in between them is a vacuous fantasy that rests somewhere comfortably between bubblegum fluff and feminist hit piece.Another thing to note is the music, which is superb throughout, and matched mostly by Gerwig's direction and her staging of some great sequences.Never a struggle to watch, shot through with occasionally successfully executed ideas, it leaves one with a good feeling, but nothing as lasting as it wishes it could be."
"Yikes if this movie offends you! 😂 I loved all the characters, the instructions and montages of how to get to the real world, the mom/daughter storyline, the depression ad lol, weird barbie, the horses, the physical comedy (showering, going down a slide), and great use of a really good Matchbox 20 song. 😂😂 Margot and Ryan are such standouts in this and the costumes are amazing. This movie is an instant classic! Such iconic moments and ideas. It is perfectly placed in 2023 and will be talked about for ages. Congrats to Greta and her team for achieving such an amazing box office opening weekend."
"With exagerated colors as promised, Greta Gerwig shows hers capacity to create a piece that's not like a bait for critics or those who love art cinema, but a commercial movie as deep as its's neccessary for it's time - except for it's publicity and public attraction. Besides it's reputed director, screenwriters, actors, references for great movies and the most popular artists composing it's soundtrack, the movie doesn't crave to be one masterpiece. Its just a regular movie that fulfills its role. Even with some metalanguage and self commentaries, it doesn't reach a self-awareness that makes this worthiest. The same works for it's social commentaries, that use strong words on the dialogues only to cover it's weakness of some social-revolutionary statement of it's own ideology. But that's ok and not something to demand on a dolls movie, right? Tho, the movie still have some high points like it's dinamicity, comedy, sensibility and editing. It will probably won, deservedly, the Oscar for best costume design. It's worthy what it's supposed to worth. It isn't what it selled it was supposed to worth. Very curious to know the film's future: if it will be forgetfull or timeless as Barbie, the doll, has been."
"Oppression is a state of mind, even when objectively you are oppressed.The biggest problem with this movie is that it leans HARD into both the feminist fantasy of oppression by MEN (as if we're some sort of ruling cabal who coordinates to keep all women subjugated-talk about intellectually lazy) AND the only acceptable man is an Allen (wimpy effeminate man). This movie could've provided a compelling argument for unifying the sexes, or how men and women complement each other, but NO. Instead in the final act, it chooses sides. And the side is comes down squarely on is the antagonist side, the ""equity"" side. The side of ""well, do unto others as you FEEL (in your hyper-oppressed feeling state) they've done unto you."" You feel like the Kens have done you wrong, so you oppress them in return. Never mind the Barbies oppressed the Kens for the entire time before the time period of the movie, and the entirety of the first act. But no, the Kens get out of line for the second act so they must pay. Equity demands retribution, so all men, excuse me, Kens, must pay.While I laughed and enjoyed the first two acts, in the end I felt thoroughly disappointed, angry, nauseated. If they had finished the movie as brilliantly as it began it would've been a 10/10, but they couldn't resist making it propaganda. I guess the joke's on me for taking our girls to it.Also, there's a monologue in the third act which could've been BRILLIANT, if the writers had been enlightened enough to recognize that that is how ALL HUMANS feel (not just women, men too). Every man I've ever known has feel the weight of crushing expectations from society, from women, from other men. It's not just a woman thing.Oh and then the last 5-10 minutes or so were... almost like a different movie. It just didn't line up with who Barbie was, and what this movie was about for that particular ending to occur.In the end, THIS KEN (me) cannot recommend this film to other Kens. Unless you're the kind of liberal / progressive man who believes the whole ""women are oppressed"" narrative. Then you'll probably love it. Every other guy though? Or the women who love them? I'd recommend taking a pass on this one. Or watch the first 75% and then leave.Bottom line this is every bit as ""toxic"" as some forms of masculinity. This is just ""toxic feminism."" And I say that as a feminist."
"I say this without a shred of irony; Greta Gerwig's Barbie is undoubtedly the film we so desperately need right now. This is the movie of our time - a film that shows us what life and society are like now, as well as shows us how we can do better. Plus, the movie is pure joy! It's a perfect mix of existentialism, heartfelt and important social-commentary and unapologetic silliness. This is the most fun I've had at a movie in a long time - and yet thanks to Gerwig's incredible script it also manages to be very a profound exploration of feminism, existentialism, the patriarchy, and masculinity all packaged in a satirical musical comedy homage to the fabric of cinema.This movie is so hard for me to review... because it's just SO GOOD! Like oh my god go see it right now, it's incredible, important, and so much fun! Genuinely, it's the most fun I've had at a movie in a long time - it's filled with pure joy and hope! Barbie exceeded all my expectations and completely lives up to the hype surrounding it! Honestly, it's pretty much a perfect film! I had a freaking blast with the movie - I loved everything it did! It's pretty much the funnest movie ever!As I write this review and reflect on the film, I had the sudden urge to revisit Greta Gerwig's breakout directorial effort; Lady Bird, and was struck by how strong and unique a voice Gerwig has as a filmmaker. Having seen her take on Little Women and now Barbie, I can easily say she is one of the most interesting and talented filmmakers working today! I'm super impressed with Gerwig as a filmmaker - all her movies are completely different and she has avoided being placed in a box. The film industry wants you to do what they know you can do very well - it wants to place filmmakers in a box, labeling someone as only a horror filmmaker, another who only does comedies, etc. Because of her ability to do LOTS of different things very well, she has been able to avoid being labeled as only one thing, making her one of the most interesting filmmakers working today. She has shown herself to be very versatile - truly on the level of Spielberg. She's easily one of the greatest of her generation. I also really love how she isn't afraid to tackle complex social issues in her films, and she somehow always manages to find really profound and interesting ways to communicate her messages. She blends social commentary with story to the point that a scene can be both emotional and profound while also hilarious and entertaining at the same time! Gerwig is also a very economical, smart storyteller - every shot, action, and line of dialogue tells us something about character or story, nothing is wasted! Plus, Gerwig seems to be endlessly creative and really commits to her visions. I've become a huge fan of Gerwig's work and Barbie has just solidified my love for her as a filmmaker!Greta Gerwig's work in Barbie is the literal definition of innovative and insightful direction with an actual authentic voice and vision to back it up. If the movie is honoured, she better come along with it. It all starts with her, and in anyone else's hands, it all falls flat. What could've been a soulless, superficial cash grab becomes something so singular, subversive, and stirring. No one could make this movie like her. She IS the movie.The secret weapon of Barbie is that magic ability Gerwig has as a writer and director to strike such a perfect balance between message and entertainment, which is something that is incredibly hard to do! Don't expect this film to be just another toy brand adaptation like the Transformers films, this is not forgettable, mindless entertainment. Barbie is trying to teach us something and has lessons that people need to hear. The commentary isn't heavy-handed or forced at all, it feels natural and, in fact, the way they comment on gender roles, masculinity and femininity, and the stereotypes of those is a lot of fun while also making you think! Like the best comedies, it is able to layer in commentary to all of the humour - the film has a really healthy sense of humour for all the themes it is exploring! I just absolutely love that in a given scene I could be laughing so hard, and yet also really engaging with the thematic and emotional material in that same scene to the extent that I did. Scenes would be both really funny and yet deep and insightful at the same time; it's very rare a film with this strong a message is this entertaining! My god Greta Gerwig is a master! Even the humour was so well done - it was so unexpected and willing to do anything! I loved it! It was a combination of both high and low-brow humour; I loved the goofiness and the slapstick elements to it, but also really loved that it managed to balance this over-the-top humour with really clever wordplay and more subtle, dryly delivered dialogue! And the fact it never took away from the seriousness or importance of a scene was just stunning to me! You can really tell Gerwig and Noah Baumbach had a lot of fun writing this one - and I'm amazed Mattel and Warner Bros allowed them to get away with some of the things they did!Though Barbie is largely silly and satirical (and yes, a ""studio movie""), there are so many moments where Greta Gerwig's singular style shines and it takes your breath away - one of the most unforgettable moments in the film is Barbie on the bench, experiencing every human emotion for the first time. (You'll know it when you see it.) I think scenes like this show that, while Barbie does have a lot to say about womanhood and coming-of-age as a woman in a complicated and contradictory world, it's ultimately just as much about what it means to be alive and be a human in general. And no one is excluded from that. (Men, I'm looking at you.)I know a lot of guys might not think they are part of the target audience for the film. But trust me, I'm a guy, and I LOVED it. I connected with so many of the themes and loved getting to see my girlfriend connect with even more of them. This movie is for everyone. Sure, women will identify with it in some areas a lot more than others will, but there is much to offer for everyone else. This movie is a film everyone needs to see, and everyone would enjoy it if they gave it a chance! Trust me, go in with an open mind and I promise you won't be disappointed.The film tells a really moving story about what it means to be a woman in today's world, and you really don't have to be a woman to be moved by it! The screenplay and themes are so well done and get better and better as the film goes on as the deeper layers begin to reveal themselves. It's truly beautiful and so heartfelt - there is so much love in this movie for women and mothers! And really when it comes down to it, this is pretty much a story about finding yourself. It's about gender roles in society and the societal construct and expression of those roles. It's about how we cope and exist with models, role models, and other influences in society. It's a breakdown of Barbie (the doll) - what she did for the world that was both good and bad, and how she could possibly help it moving forward. Gerwig wasn't afraid to rip apart the way in which Barbie is an outdated concept and represents the worst of what we think gender means, such as how it has negatively influenced body image standards for women. Gerwig also ponders the extent that the legacy of Barbie has contributed to or detracted from feminist movements - has Barbie empowered women or instead created outdated stereotypes? Greta Gerwig almost did too good of a job for Mattel! I can't believe Mattel agreed to this, it very much critiques them and Barbie at times. It's just such a smart movie and manages to cover all these topics and themes in such a natural and entertaining way without ever feeling forced!And oh my god! America Ferrera has such a powerful monologue in the film about how women have to try to navigate society and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I saw the film. It's one of the most profound pieces of writing I've seen in quite a while and it's delivered beautifully. Probably the part of the movie that's stuck with me the most since watching it. It's sending an important message to the audience while also allowing the film's narrative to move forward smoothly and efficiently. And I can't even imagine how much it will mean to all the women and girls who see the film - I know it really meant a lot to my girlfriend and has allowed many women to feel seen! America Ferrera is the film's beating heart and luminous soul, she gives such a genuinely moving performance and a show-stopping monologue that had the audience applauding. No one can write a monologue like Greta Gerwig!As I said, the film meant a lot to my girlfriend, and I wanted to include these thoughts she had after we saw it, as I think it really shows how truly important the message of this film is:""Barbie is a movie about growing up and realizing womanhood isn't all pink, pleasure, and possibility. Realizing that much of the world will hate you - always - no matter what you do, simply because of who you are. Realizing that there comes a point when you either have to accept complacency within the patriarchy, or ostracization and vilification outside of it.Or, maybe there's another way. Maybe womanhood isn't all the fun and freedom dreamed up in youth, but maybe we don't have to abandon it entirely either. Maybe, just maybe, once we accept and begrudgingly embrace the often brutal reality of our everyday existence - while still retaining our inner strength at the same time - we can better reconcile all these cultural complications and contradictions and find a way to move through the world cautiously, but authentically. Revelling in our - and the world's - flaws instead of willfully overlooking them in favour of the fantasy."
"As I said at the beginning of the article, I lost my expectations before watching the movie because of the trailers. It felt like they were going on a story, especially one that would end up with big problems in the future. I will continue to watch an average movie when the analogies made on the internet seem to confirm my suspicions. But Barbie is hiding with a pretty well-written script. He uses drama in the parts that should be serious, and humor in the parts. From that moment on, the script can be both preserved and conveyed to the audience much better. Moreover, when the editing is at a fluent pace, you watch the movie breathlessly. The fact that its duration is under two hours is also nice considering the length of mainstream movies in recent years."
"On the plus side, this was an ambitious, dazzling film with what I felt was an original concept. It explored the world of gender stereotyping and male-female relationships, using the world of Barbie and Ken as its base point. There was a strong feminist theme running through it, but I did not find this overwhelming. Whilst the male figures were often portrayed as stupid and one-dimensional, this was done with some wit and indeed affection.The action migrated between the real world and the mythical world of Barbie, and so perhaps it was no surprise that the plot tended to meander and remained unconvincing. The energy of the film was sustained by the comedy and the zaniness of the characters.I differ from some critics in that I thought the best performance came from Margot Robbie as Barbie. Her character bounced between parody and realism but she managed the demands well. I thought that the much acclaimed Ryan Gosling tended to over-act and his character became annoying.This may be down to my age and my Englishness, but I was unable to make out the detail of the many snappy one-liners that were delivered. The young and the American will probably not have this trouble.Though likeable and even moving in places, altogether this film felt like less than the sum of its parts. Its attempts at juggling comedy and serious themes, fantasy and reality, were not ultimately successful and it became incoherent and lacking in some kind of unity.Ultimately, for me, the acid test of a film is the issue of whether or when I start wanting it to end. I made to about two-thirds of the way through."
"Thought i was in for a witty, sugar coat covered comedy in which i would have sang the praises of Robbie, Gosling and the production design team. And while that for sure happened, i also found an unexpectedly deep movie, one that even if maybe at times is a bit redundant with its expression of theme, always find an original way to convey it, and really goes some unexpected places emotionally. Truly special, at times laugh-out-loud funny, and in a couple of instances surprisingly moving. The direction is focused, Gosling's comedic timing is impeccable, Robbie's bravura shines throughout, the soundtrack is one smash hit after the other, and yes, omg, the sets are truly amazing."
"For starters this movie was made by women for women. I was not the intended audience, which is fine. But I feel like there is a good story somewhere hidden here, or there could have been one. That everyone could have really liked.The movie is well made; I could tell that the people who made the movie liked Barbie, and knew their stuff. And that bleed into the movie. It has a cool set, lot's of creative choices and has good actors. With some genuinely funny gags and jokes.The cons: Some movies are great pieces of art, where you can't nail down what exactly the movie is about or trying to say. The classic disney movies like Beauty and the Beast, Peter Pan Pinocchio are good examples where they more about exploring ideas and themes.Then there some films like Atlas Shrugged where you know exactly what it's trying to say from the get-go. This is one of the those films, except it doesn't just focus on one message but three or four awkwardly placed one after another. This film felt like a first draft and could of used a couple rewrites to tighten it up.I don't think this film could ever decided what it wanted to be. And it tried to be too many things at once making it a little nonsensical. And all the main characters were brought together in a very inorganic way. There was even this car chase scene in middle which I believe they wrote in for strict purpose of doing a car commercial for Chevrolet.Also there were some very weird parts of the movie. Where the messaging was just wrong in so many ways. I'll just give one example and finish on that. At the end Barbie is sad because the patriarchy won but is roused when the mom did a rant about all the problems women have. But she is wrong, everything she listed weren't women problems they were people problems. That's life. I sorry but it's not the fact you are a women that you struggle with being either a respected boss or a liked boss. Go talk to Machiaveli. These are problems everyone has.Anyway that's my review. I hope it's balanced and fair and gave you a good idea about what this film is ."

"Barbie, while not something I would typically watch, caught my interest. I watched the trailer and felt as though this would not be a typical kids movie. The humor surprised me as I laughed multiple times. The cameos were great. The main cast was perfectly cast. Ryan Gosling shined as Ken. I was overall pleased with the movie.I will say that the humor is catered to parents in some aspects. The kids also have humor that they will enjoy. This movie is mainly for preteen/teenagers. Some parents of kids that are 10 years of age or younger may find the movie offensive.Overall, solid movie with a great cast and a good script. No doubt a movie that was need for this summer's box office."
"Any time a movie prioritizes messaging, there's an all too long history of the end result suffering, whether in terms of its storytelling, its general craftsmanship, or both. Broadly, this trend holds true even when a message is important, admirable, and agreeable. Case in point, last year's slasher 'They/them' was troubled in various ways, but above all in how immensely upfront it was about its otherwise gratifying messaging; sure enough, the writing suffered in turn. This 2023 film is not free of that same issue, for it is extremely, emphatically forthright and downright strident about the ideas at the root of the screenplay and which it wishes to convey; they're terrific ideas, but literally from the very beginning we see and hear exactly, indisputably, what the script wants to communicate. More than that, this is a picture that strives to be, say, and do a lot, and in fact it is, says, and does so much that it's a little overwhelming - I earnestly think the finished product would have benefited from some thoughts being left out so as to tighten the whole and assert greater focus. And though I somewhat repeat myself, it's well worth accentuating that the feature is majorly heavy-handed, with astonishingly little of the content being given a delicate, nuanced touch for the viewer to pick up on or feel for ourselves. It's a title that wears its neon pink heart on its sleeve, and there's no possibility of missing it.And yet what's truly amazing is that for all this, 'Barbie' is also a movie that is incredibly, exceptionally smart. I can't readily think of any other title that was so predominantly blunt, gawky, and straightforward in its presentation, but which simultaneously impressed with the absolute supreme intelligence behind everything that's being shoved in our faces. Within the slant of being overfull and immoderate, it's nevertheless remarkably well-rounded and balanced. Everything it endeavors to be, say, and do is treated with that same frank hand, and all is blended together into a slurry where no facet is allowed to especially outshine the others. It bounces from trenchantly triumphant to awesomely artificial, to wildly wacky, to dourly dispiriting, to honestly heartfelt, to satisfyingly sincere, and back again, but the progression still feels natural and meaningful, not to mention purposeful, and we never experience whiplash. It is entirely unabashed about the values it wields like a flaming sword of vengeance, and the themes that serve as its very blood: feminism, independence, denunciation of patriarchy and toxic masculinity; self-discovery and self-realization outside any strict confines or definitions that are forced upon or underhandedly given to us, or which we unwittingly construct for ourselves; the need to be active agents of our own liberation, active defenders of what we wish to build, and active stewards of what we wish to maintain - and much, much more. Then, too, it plainly champions diversity even in just the casting, but ultimately acknowledges the advisable place and just importance of diversity, and equality, in governance and representation; touches upon the evils of capitalism, and also the multifaceted elements of what Mattel's signature doll represents, for good and for ill; recognizes that women, who can and should be anything they want, can be and may want to be mothers, too. It's not inaccurate to say that 'Barbie' acts to upholds what are commonly seen as leftist or humanist ideals, yet those who decry the feature as part of some subversive agenda either haven't actually seen it, or can't discern the immediately transparent notion that values that seek a better, more equitable world for everyone can only be said to be dangerous insofar as they threaten those values that work to sustain inequality and injustice.Meanwhile, setting aside the writing which is so enormously essential to all that this is, the film is stupendously well done in every other regard. The cast is a blast, simply put, obviously all having a fantastic time - but for as weird and widely varied as the parts and scenes may be, everyone also gives excellent performances no less worthy of appreciation than anything else that any of them have done. It rather goes without saying that Margot Robbie is altogether luminous as the stereotypical protagonist, but I personally am also very happy to see Hari Nef here so prominently, and Kate McKinnon is an outright joy. The crew put in magnificent work in every last regard, from spellbinding, colorful sets, to bewitching costume design, to impeccable hair and makeup, and more. Editing, cinematography, direction, sound, stunts, effects: I do not jest when I say that everything here looks fabulous. The music is a wonderfully fun garnish that I in no way anticipated, and all who contributed to the soundtrack in any way are to be congratulated; those instances of choreography that we see are utterly superb, providing a level of glee that I'd have never supposed even based on advance marketing. And as if all the huge, concrete ideas behind the screenplay weren't enough, the story in and of itself is genuinely entertaining and compelling, let alone highly rewarding. The scene writing is marvelously strong, rich, and varied, keeping the proceedings fresh and engaging from start to finish; the dialogue and characters are as shrewdly penned as anything else in these two hours. What here is not brilliant, when all is said and done? Well, I gave my answer when I first sat down, but even if it's not flawless, the imperfections here are less about any discrete weaknesses or shortcomings and more about how stunningly busy the script is, stuffed to the proverbial gills and nearly straining to keep itself together even in the face of so much skill and wit. And if that's the worst that I can say about a picture, then I'd say it's done darn well for itself indeed.The promise of a star-studded cast, filled with persons I admire, and the involvement of an esteemed filmmaker and her partner, did nothing to quell skepticism when news first surfaced of a live-action Barbie movie on the big screen. The first teaser and subsequent trailer elicited much favor, but still I had my reservations, wondering above all how the same dazzling energy could possibly be sustained for a full-length feature. Then, to be frank, there came the swift, abrasive reactions from certain people - reactions that were laughably alarmist and apoplectic, not to mention outlandish and unreasonable. Suffice to say that such breath-taking reactions were the tipping point for me, as they elevated Greta Gerwig's 'Barbie,' from ""a film I might like to check out if I have the chance,"" to a must-see. And now that I have? While all my doubts have been erased and I could hardly be more pleased, I can also safely say that this is not the movie I was expecting. That riotous energy of the teaser and trailer isn't here for the whole runtime (though, most of it, certainly). What we get as complement and in its place, though, is masterful mindfulness and craftsmanship, and a jarring, somewhat backhanded, but very welcome and refreshing, wholehearted sincerity that is all the more smarter for the ways in which, sights unseen, it's kept hidden. Ironically, I ponder if this isn't too lofty in its writing, possibly going over the heads of those who might benefit most from what it has to offer. Even if that's true, though, this is so splendidly well done that it will hold up indefinitely, and be something to revisit time and again, both for those who want to see what we may have missed before, and to ensure that its message reaches the widest possible audience. When I was younger I'd never have thought a Barbie flick could be this good and substantive, but here we are: Gerwig's picture is well worth watching, and earns my very high, hearty recommendation."
"Barbie offers a delightful and fun-filled experience, encompassing chuckles, joy, and, surprisingly, some deeper discussions surrounding its creation's intended impact on feminism versus the portrayal of opposing views on women in real life. It even delves into the influence of patriarchy, hyper-masculinity, and its effects on the mental and emotional struggles women face daily. Initially, I found myself a bit confused since it wasn't quite what I expected. The movie touched on dark themes like death, which left me wanting more answers, especially since it was mentioned often, but it didn't tie up that loose end.Despite that, the film doesn't target kids but rather adults who once played with Barbies. For the moms out there, it's definitely a movie worth watching.However, I'm conflicted because it felt like the movie couldn't quite decide what it wanted to accomplish. With so many themes and stories to tell, it somewhat detracts from the overall impact. Nevertheless, it remains an enjoyable experience that nostalgically brings back memories. I'd give Barbie The Movie a rating of 7.5/10. The hype, dressing up, and reliving childhood memories add to its appeal."
"Barbie was a very funny and cute movie, however, the movie had more fluff than substance. The plot of this movie to me seems like it was created by writing ""lego movie"" and ""barbie goes to the real world"" on a piece of paper and then just winging it from there. The movie did not flow very well and the plot line seemed almost secondary to the message that the movie was trying to preach. I say preach because the movie never actually showed any conflicts for women except for maybe one or two quick shots. Instead we got a monologue from America Ferrera's character telling us the problems but never showing us any. For this reason I feel it was hard to build a connection with Barbie especially in the final act when the movie took a turn to try and be more deep than funny goofy like it had been the whole movie. There was also not very good resolution for a lot of characters. The Kens never truly got a resolution, like the writers couldn't come up with a good solution. Will Farrels character seemed almost forgotten about by the half way mark of the movie. Overall it was a very funny movie, but not a very solid one. The message felt like it was preached rather than shown, the ending felt forced down the throat rather than conclusive. Also there was a ridiculous 5 minute car ad for chevrolet that made me feel like I was watching a super bowl half time commercial."
"Finally got around to viewing this, and it was really great fun. A solid story. It's Aldus Huxley's 'Brave New World' and Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis', done with lots of pink and lots of music and dancing, far more than I expected.Margo Robbie pretty much owns this movie, and rightly so. She and Ryan Gosling take over the screen and must of had a load of fun.The set design is very inventive and is very pivotal to the films plot. Never seen so many high heels in a mainstream movie. So many great costumes that help along with the pop background.Really silly and funny look at life, very metaphoric, plenty of fun here, the screening was full, just 6 seats left."
"This movie was fantastic. Leave it to the writers Greta and Noah to handle the topic of womanhood so well. The details on the set were outstanding. It even addresses some of how Barbie was created. Being on the theater surrounded by women watching this film felt like a significant moment.I will say to all the 1 star reviews and people who brought their 5 year olds to the theater, know your director. This was not a film created to advertise for Barbie, this was thoughtfully created by people who have written indi films and gotten nominated for Oscar's. They know what they want to say and why. The target audience for this film has to be old enough to understand words like Patriarchy which is used a lot in the movie. But don't let this deter you. There's enough music, humor, and and character development for Barbie and Ken to keep the audience entertained even if it's over their head."
"I guess my starting point was not a huge fan of anything Barbie, but to be honest I went in moderately openminded. The film was dull at times and at others quite subversive!Some great humour some odd moments, felt a little stilted but that was clearly the intent of the film makers.I sat through it feeling at the end mildly perplexed and unsure if I enjoyed it or not.I felt it was at times quite clever but still a bit confusing much of the time.As a 67 year old I may not be the best judge nor did the chatting 7-8 year old two seats away from me add much to the experience.Go see and make your mind up, overall I much preferred Oppenheimer."
"The movie starts with the presentation of iconic barbie world and hilarious childhood references but it gets progressively deeper.It tackles sexism, misogyny and existentialism. While it left me crying laughing it appeared a bit all over the place. I believe it would be a lot beter if it had only focused on one theme.Other than that it was an insanely self-aware, bizarre, iconic, relatable and suprisingly deep movie. Greta knew what she was doing. Goslings line delivery was hilarious and Robbie added range to an expectedly superficial character.I would also like to mention the heatbreaking yet beautiful Billie Eilish masterpiece of a song. Great job!"
"No doubt you've spent a few months hearing about Barbenheimer, referring to the simultaneous releases of Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" and Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"". Obviously the movies couldn't be more different. I saw ""Oppenheimer"" last weekend, as arms control experts had recommended seeing it before ""Barbie"" after all, she lives in the world that he helped bring about.Anyway, this movie addresses the issue of how we define gender roles, and of course looks at matriarchy versus patriarchy. The plot actually reminded me of the 2007 Disney flick ""Enchanted"", with the idea of an ultra-feminine character from an apparently perfect world suddenly coming to the real world.All in all, it's an over-the-top but enjoyable flick. You'll probably leave the theater asking yourself what it means to be a man or a woman. Along with Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, the cast includes America Ferrera, Simu Liu, Emma Mackey, Ncuti Gatwa, Kate McKinnon, Will Ferrell, Helen Mirren and Michael Cera. Therefore, the supporting cast makes this movie a link between ""Ugly Betty"", ""Kim's Convenience"", ""Sex Education"" (twice), ""Ghostbusters"", ""Anchorman"", ""Prime Suspect"" and ""Arrested Development""."
"Barbie is a movie that you start laughing of the critics that are put in such an intelligent way (you have to think fast between laughs), amazed by the idea of a perfect world and suddenly they start to go in your feelings and bring out so many realizations about yourself with funny dialogs. We never goin to forget what it is see Margot and Ryan such an incredible performance the way them put so many emotions and still keep that doll mindset is brilliant and for Greta all my reverence it's breathtaking think that she decided to go up front with such strong movie and we didn't expect anything different from her. Oscar winners here we go."
"When things start going awry in Barbieland, it is up to 'stereotypical Barbie' (blonde hair, blue eyed version) to reset the matriarchal pieces in the perfect plastic world that represents everyone equally...or slightly less equal (if inverse to reality were offsetting). While Robbie is an idealistic Barbie, Gosling's charismatic nature completely directs attention away from Margot anytime the two share frame - it really does become the Ken movie for much of the second act as Gosling's character dominates the screen.Of course, this is all the plot oversimplified to its core. The moments of unabashed humor, and there is lots of it, speak for Gerwig's witted personality...unfortunately the preachy tone carried throughout the movie also does too. The film has its moments, even if the ending leaves some viewers indifferent. It's probably worth the watch if you just want a few chuckles and nothing more."
"BarbieDid you grow up playing with Barbie's? If so, you probably know that not everyone likes the idea of Barbie. Some people think Barbie's are harmful to children. Other people love Barbie. This new movie called, Barbie, explores why Barbie could be problematic. Greta Gerwig is the director, previously she directed Little Women. It stars Margot Robbie from Birds of Prey and Suicide Squad, Ryan Gosling from The Notebook and La La Land, Michael Cera from Arrested Development, Helen Mirren, and Rhea Perlman.In 1959, Ruth Handler, the co-founder of the Mattel toy company, created Barbie. She wanted this doll to inspire little girls to dream and know they can be whatever they want. This thought process seems sexist, it leaves out little boys, who also can be whatever they want. The movie will show you that Handler's idea that Barbie will make society better, hasn't worked out as she probably wanted. Barbie (Margot Robbie) and Ken (Ryan Gosling) live in Barbie land, where women are in charge. Barbie needs to travel to the real world, where she discovers men are in charge and she isn't the inspiration she thought she was.Robbie plays two sides of the same character, at first Barbie is very carefree in Barbie land, and oblivious to all societies' problems. When she gets to the real world however, she discovers things seem to be the opposite from where she came from. Not only is Gosling nice to look at but he also will make the audience laugh. Ken has always felt left out of Barbie land, until he travels to the real world with Barbie. Unfortunately, he learns the wrong lesson from capitalism. He finds out men are in charge, and wants that for Barbie land. What his take away should have been however, is that men and women can both hold equal power. Alan (Michael Cera) doesn't have a duplicate, therefore he knew who he was from the beginning. He has good morals and values, which gives him confidence to be the best version of himself. Meanwhile, Ken and Barbie are struggling to figure out who they are, and want to be.The dancing, choreography, and facial expressions were all done spectacularly well. The cast, including the supporting characters did a wonderful job. Gosling does an excellent job, portraying a more submissive Ken in the beginning, then more dominant, when he wants to take charge of Barbie land. Robbie's role as Barbie was much different than when she played Harley Quinn. Barbie is nice, kind, and not evil, while Harley Quinn is a criminal, who could be good from time to time. These roles show she is good at playing different parts, which will help her in the future.Not only does this movie have some funny moments, but it also has themes that are relevant to what's happening in life today. Capitalism, equality for all, female empowerment, and self-acceptance, are all things people need to know about.There is a lot of pressure on women to be perfect. Women have to go to work, which usually means getting payed less than men, taking care of the house and kids, all while looking their best, which is difficult to do all the time. Mattel hoped that Barbie would be an inspiration for women. Unfortunately, she doesn't even look like most people, Barbie is extremely skinny, which is an unrealistic standard for anyone to live up to. Along with that, the company, Mattel, and its founders aren't exactly honest people. Years after Barbie was made, Handler was found guilty of tax evasion.Barbie shows one of the reasons the WGA (Writers Guild of America) and SAG (Screen Actors Guild) are striking. They all want better pay, meanwhile the top CEO's of company's make millions a year. However, the way it should be is more equal, meet somewhere in the middle. Don't pay people so little they need multiple jobs to support their family, but also no one is asking to become a millionaire. Barbie is a good movie that happened to come out at the perfect time. I would encourage everyone to go see this movie. It was well cast and has multiple messages surrounding issues our society faces today."
"Barbie is living a perfect life in her Barbie world filled with Barbies and Kens. Without the fear of change and the assurance of perfection, Barbie gets through the day partying until she starts thinking about death. Fearing malfunction, she is asked to visit the Real World to find her human pal to resolve the issue and get back to her perfect life. Ken follows her to the Real World where both come across patriarchy, which overwhelms them. When Barbie returns back to her world, she realizes what she is about to lose and how Barbie along with the other Barbies, couple of humans and an Allan, work together to save their world forms the story.Initially, it takes a bit of time to get used to the narrative as well as the humor. Good thing is it doesn't take much time to get me invested in the world of Barbie and Ken. The perfect casting ensured the smooth flow of the story and the likes of Kate McKinnon, Will Ferrell took care of elevating a simple scene with their impeccable comic timing. It is the final act, where Greta Gerwig proved why she is among the best to handle mother-daughter relationship or to even narrate women.There are several scenes that earns instant laughter and those scenes are cleverly handled. I did expect atleast a couple of more dance numbers. Ryan Gosling easily became pick of the lot and Margot Robbie owned her character as Barbie. The monologue scene with the mother worked for me and ofcourse the Ken's breakdown towards the end. If the first hour provides genuine humor, it is the second half that truly make it a thorough entertainer blending humor with emotions."
"Attending the prepremiere of the much-anticipated Barbie movie was an experience I won't soon forget, but unfortunately, not for the right reasons. At least 85% of the movie was pure hype, creating high expectations that were ultimately let down.The film seemed primarily aimed at a teenage audience, with its trendy aesthetics and themes, but it struggled to find its identity. It swung between childish and adultish elements, making it challenging to categorize and leaving viewers like me feeling a bit perplexed about its target demographic.In the first two-thirds of the movie, I managed to find a few moments to laugh, but my interest began to wane as it entered the final third. The lack of a compelling plot and engaging storytelling made it a tedious watch, and I found myself almost falling asleep in the cinema.One of the major letdowns was the extensive marketing that overshadowed the entire experience. What made the movie even more uncomfortable for me was the audience's overwhelming obsession with everything pink. Nearly 90% of the cinema-goers were dressed in various shades of pink, and it felt like an extravagant posing session rather than an immersive movie experience. It did not help that movie itself was pretty average - it heavily depends on references and superficial jokes, which can be amusing on occasion. However, after being exposed to nearly two hours of such content, I was completely brain damaged .I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from a Barbie movie, but this certainly wasn't it. It fell into the same pit as some of Disney's live-action adaptations that fail to capture the essence of the original material.Despite having a few moments of laughter and initial intrigue, I wouldn't rate it more than 4 out of 10. If you're looking for a meaningful cinematic experience, this film might not be the best choice."
"I went in to this movie expecting to it to be fun based on the trove a press for it.It does not disappoint. Margot Robbie brought a depth of emotion to the role that makes it a special character and performance. America Ferrera also was sensational and is probably an under appreciated actor for as much as she consistently delivers in her films and shows.Gosling, Liu, and Kingsley Ben-Adir brought plenty of the expected levity for the Ken roles. Gosling is well known for both his dramatic and comedic abilities at this point, but selfishly watching him ham it up and be funny never gets old.As expected, the movie had plenty of ludicrously silly moments that and brought humor from a lot of different directions and perspectives.Specifically, the mini-dissection of the patriarchy and evolution of the characters to more fully realize themselves played very well to me.I could not recommend this movie enough. As worthwhile as any two hours you can spend."
"I found Barbie to be funny, self-deprecating, intelligent and masterfully pretty. The choice of making Barbieworld feel plastic adds an incredible layer of humor to it all.Gosling, Margot Robbie and cast are a charming ensemble of top tier performers giving their all and it shows. Robbie's self-serious approach to Barbie makes Gosling's self-seriousness as Ken even funnier.When I left Barbie, all I could think is ""This movie is SO PG-13"" in the best way possible. It's sexless, while also acknowledging sex and physical attraction. It's crude without raunchy language. It's self-deprecating humor is second to none. It's absurdist humor is uniquely millennial/Gen Z. I found this film hilarious and fun.I recommend everyone watches this and also doesn't take it too seriously."
"Barbie is exactly the movie the trailers promised. Different from what you expect from a toy adaptation but not fully up to the talents of the writers and director involved. An existential comedy for little girls and adults is the best way it can be described. It's very well made with the use of extensive sets and amazing actors in it. Entertaining throughout the movie even if it is mostly predictable. Great message even if it gets preachy a little bit, which surely is going to invite a lot of hate towards it too. It also shows different sides of the kind of issues in our world by juxtaposition. The self-awareness works to a point too. But the constant and blatant toy promotion kind of makes the whole thing almost pointless. I mean, I get it that Mattel only made this so they can sell their toys and was ready for the film to criticise them for the same but do they really have to overcompensate for that like this?"
"This movie was so unexpected.Completely opposite to what I thought it would be.The best movie I've seen in a long time.There were moments it had me laughing and moments in tears. It gently pushed me into self reflection and introspection which I never realised I needed to do for the longest of time.The movie dealt with so many issues, such as societal expectancies, emotional depence, perfectionism, stress, anxiety.. It brought forward self awareness, emotional intelligence, and so many insights into ones self.This movie is a must see for all women and men who are open to growth and developing their mindsets.As a millenial this movie resonated on another level, it reminded me of the self I was at a younger age, before falling into societal norms.Will definitely watch it again and again."
"Barbie is a weird film that is pretty well made. It tells the story of how one of many Barbie's in Barbie-land leave and go into the real world to find the person who owns them as a toy. In the real world, they see what impact Barbie has, or fails to have, as a product on the minds of young girl consumers. This information changes her, and Ken's opinion of themselves and they return home and deal with the aftermath of this revelation.Barbie is well played by Margot Robbie who is an excellent actress and is perfectly cast in the role. While Ryan Gosling is a strange choice for Ken he does adequate work as Ken and gives depth and subtext to the otherwise shallow one dimensional Barbie-companion.This movie poses a lot of questions, makes some strange decisions, and has some intelligent (albeit shallow) things to say about the relationship between boys and girls. (Not men and women, but boys and girls.).It's worth watching - but memorable more in how weird it is rather than how good it is."
"This movie is NOT what I expected at all. I thought it would be your average formulaic movie, but no. This movie is deep. It explores topics such as feminism & the patriarchy, femininity, existentialism, and a lot more. It uses incredible comedy to make its points, and hence, doesn't come across preachy at all.Greta Gerwig is absolutely incredible, this is 100% her best work so far. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling did a splendid job, as did the rest of the supporting characters.Also, the nostalgia you'll feel when you watch this movie is insane. It's so crazy how similar every girl's Barbie play-stories are. I love that I'm just like other girls!!"
"Granted, my experience of Barbie may have been influenced by the fact that I saw it an hour after getting out of Oppenheimer, but I gotta say: I thoroughly enjoyed watching this one in a crowded theater on opening weekend. The degree of difficulty here cannot be overstated. Just making a decent movie about Barbie is tough. Making one that is hilarious and insightful and at points actually touching? That should be impossible, but Gerwig nails it in many ways. Not everything worked for me, but not everything works for me in any comedy. Overall, they told a story about a toy which I have no attachment to (and at points would have described as problematic), and totally sucked me in. And based on the theater's reaction around me, I wasn't alone."
"As we all know the title of the movie suggest fun, tons of 'cheesy' moments, drama and a lot of imaginations. I entered the theater expecting the same and placed all my expectations low and just go how the film flows. Surprisingly, it has a lot of funny moments in the film, at times 'silly', but it was all understandable and placed creatively and entertaining. Margot Robbie as ""Barbie"" was surely a perfect role of her, while Ryan Gosling as ""Ken"" did the same and he was more funnier as expected! Visual effects were cool to watch and soundtrack was for me, a phenomenal! People do see mixed reviewed after seeing it, but do see Barbie as a film and enjoy its ride!"
"Barbie is enjoyable, thats for sure, but it brings some problems such as the films plot, which is all over the place, and goes in a lot of unlikable directions at times. However, this doesn't bring the film down, as there are enjoyable and smart aspects of the film that climb the hurdles to make Barbie an enjoyable summer watch that caters for all ages!The film kicks things off in Barbie land, and its here where audiences will start to fall in love with the aesthetics of the film. Astonishing set designs,usage of visual fx and cinematography really help us step into the shoes of a Barbie doll. The first act of the film really focus on this idea, and almost shows off the impressive work that has been put into the creation of this sublime world.It is when we delve further into this plot though that we start to see issues. The whole vibe the film gives off and its tone surprisingly shifts into something much darker and political when the real world gets involved. It is definitely far from unwatchable though, and the charm of the characters and the humor actually make this specific part of the storyline enjoyable. Despite being fun, the story goes off track a lot, completely ignoring any form of logic to take risks by giving off a little too many messages that only makes the plot more predictable and cliché.The individual, interior journeys these characters go on though is the clear standout of the film for me. The arcs of almost all characters are played out really cleverly, and whilst the story as a whole is a mess, the developing dynamics between the Barbie's and the Ken's make this film worth watching alone. What is done with these characters is really fitting to some of the messages the film tries to give off, even though it may seem there are too many to process.Acting is phenomenal. Both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are CLEAR standouts, yet all cast members have their moments.Ultimately, Barbie does get messy, especially when the real-world comes to play. Yet its the exploration of Barbie Land and what it means to be a barbie that make this a fun, yet somewhat perceptive, summer watch!"
"Honestly, not too sure what my partner and I were expecting, but we figured it would be a fun, empowering, and sweet movie.Instead, we got a preachy, confused, mess that oscillated between comedy and social commentary in a wildly jarring way.Unfortunately, I think the writers took the opportunity to project their feelings onto the audience. The message seems dated and naive. At best it's a bit of an eye roll, at worst it's an attempt to shame young girls into a self defeating thought process.Acting, sound track, set design, and some bits of comedy were really good, and there is some genuine cinema in there."
"Greta Gerwig Director of Little women and Lady bird did a great job directing movie Barbie. I did not own or play with barbie dolls. Made the whole concept of Barbie very enjoyable and motivational for women in general .Margot Robbie is perfect as Barbie, beautiful in appearance, perky by nature. After stepping into reality , Barbie meets strong women ..different Barbie.. There is a Barbie with different labels... women in all fields. Conventional ordinary Barbie is not ordinary anymore. The movie is 1hr 54 minutes. In the beginning it is all about beautiful Barbie and then a beautiful twist to the story with planet earth having Barbie in all aspects and professions of life. I thoroughly enjoyed Ken ( excellent lovable Ryan Gosling) wanting Barbie and seeking for conventional Barbie in now matured Barbie Margot Robbie. Fun, great movie with lots of lessons for empowering women and teaching little girls to step out of beautiful fake kitchens and playhouses and feeding dolls. New dimension to womanhood is beautifully embedded in impressionable brains of little girls and teenagers rushing in pink clothes to feel like Barbie. Great job , Greta Gerwig. Adorable perfect Margot Robbie as Barbie who steps out of conventional type cast beauty. Excellent ensemble."
"What a cinematic experience. The mediatic effect that this film is having and will have is beyond imagination. I don't know where to start. I feel like Greta is kind of an underrated director but one of the most unique voices in Hollywood. This film is iconic. Using the character and icon of Barbie to tell and send such strong messages is something that not everyone can do. Throughout the film I was always connecting it to Disney's Soul, due to particular sequences that were so strong and that convey the same message (Barbie experiencing the real life for the first time): life is unique, a beautiful gift that it's worth exploring and enjoying despite its suffering - using this solid base to talk about crucial matters like politics, patriarchy, feminism, life as a woman in all its aspects, all in a really enjoyable, beautifully crafted comedic way. Barbie (and the married writers) manages to unite different kinds of genres (musical - Ryan Gosling is sublime in musicals... you know what I mean -, bits of war sequences and the dramatic layer) in a special way. This movie is near to perfection. The epilogue really adds to that perfection, with a heart-wrenching soundtrack by Billie Eilish and some stunning visuals and another expected brilliant performance by Margot Robbie. It's her year, and she deserves all of it. To summarise the film: I AM KENOUGH!"
"The entire cast does such a great job and it seems everyone had a fun time making the film. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are of course stand outs, but Michael Cera as Allan and Issa Rae as Barbie were also phenomenol! The sets were gorgeous, according to behind the scenes, everything was practical when it could be, and that made such an obvious difference in bringing the Barbie world to life. The costumes!!! So much fun, so much pink, and Robbie's long-standing relation with chanel wormed it's way into costuming as well, truly there are a bunch of unique and extremely well done pieces!However, this is still a movie made to appeal to the widest audience to make the most money possible. There's some popular feminism, but nothing that challenges status quo, and nothing too disagreeable for the average audience. It's pretty to look at, but lacks adequate substance in favor of just bringing up the talking point to say they acknowledged it. Furthermore the movie is extremely uninterested in exploring anything about Mattel's business practices or perpetual consumerism. Not that I was expecting it to, but both those potential issues are very blatantly sidelined and made for humor which sometimes feels like a bit much for me.Anyways, if you want a pretty looking and pretty funny movie that'll definitely continue to make a stupid amount of money, it is well worth it!"
"I got into the theater with zero expectations, and I can only say I was very positively surprised.I loved the comedy in this movie as I think I haven't had that much fun in a while. And the other thing I love about this is that because the movie is a goofy comedy, you don't have to take the everything too seriously and you just go with it, and you enjoy the comedic ride all the way through the movie.On the other hand, the movie also provides a lot of criticism towards the many flaws in our society and all through the movie you find things, that reflect that, and I believe they are portrayed perfectly.Without spoiling to much I would recommend the movie to anyone as on the one hand I think it produces a lot of important messages and on the other I can't think of anyone who wouldn't enjoy the comedic experience."
"Everything is perfect in Barbieland. Every day is identikit pink perfection for all the Barbies, and also for the Kens as long as they're getting attention. Then stereotypical Barbie starts getting dark thoughts, which can only be due to the human who is playing with her in the Real World. So, accompanied by Ken, Barbie sets off through the rip in reality to find the relevant human, only to find that the Real World is not at all like Barbieland. And Ken discovers patriarchy. And horses.As a film, this is an enjoyable mess. It aims to be toy nostalgia for little girls of all ages, escapist silliness, wild fantasy, social satire with well-staged musical production numbers, in fact a bizarre mix of elements which shoukdn't work together, but somehow do. It's bright, colourful, tuneful, quite funny, well played, sometimes thoughtful and thought-provoking, mikdly feminist (though not without taking pokes at feminism and vacuous femininity as well as toxic masculinity) and, broadly, good-hearted. Helen Mirren's narration is dry and funny, and the last line is a killer.Looking at the film as a social phenomenon, I have two observations. One, a lot of people have got their knickers in a twist, and they are mostly males who feel very threatened by the mildly feminist message in this movie ABOUT DOLLS. This film is not is big a deal as it thinks it is, and it's certainly not as big a deal as wounded males seem to think it is. Two the cinema was packed (two-thirds female) and the audience seemed to enjoy it. The only films I have seen filling cinemas in recent years have been aimed at female audiences. No comment!"
"I somehow managed to convince my immensely macho friend to watch this film with me and boy was it an amazing experience! Margot Robbie added a level of depth to this character that has previously never been shown. Her performance wholeheartedly needs to garner her every award for acting. Ryan Gosling as Ken also needs awards, he was immensely funny and showed emotions at the right time. America Ferreira needs to win an award for best supporting actress, her monologue towards the end was just wow!!! The film has a ton of heart, humor and the ability to make you go from being sad, reflecting life to laughing out loud. I would highly recommend that everyone watch this film, it's quite the experience."
"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are most charming and superb in their roles as Barbie and Ken. Also here and there are some really funny and entertaining scenes, but the ""message"" (you know all that blabla about patriarchy and matriarchy and all the cliches regarding gender from a certain point of view) drag the whole movie rather down - at least for me. For sure the movie is one great coup by the marketing team of Mattel to fit and place Barbie World into the currents of today's zeitgeist (like all those Barbie dolls they sell these days that are inclusive) - I take any bet, the sells will rise these days profoundly. Anyway, if you are in the mood for comedy and can cope with those ""preachy elements"" especially in the second half of the movie, you may find some good entertainment (like I did), but if you are really fed up with such ""progressive"" matters, you should avoid watching this one. Because of Robbie and Gosling and some fine settings and scenes this movie does not crash but Barbie is without doubt just another most hyped affair by the media, and the plot rather a very predictable one, if you think about it."
"I am going to be so shocked if this isn't the biggest movie of the year. Barbie was fun, hilarious, while also being real, and heart wrenching. I found myself laughing and crying throughout the film. The movie is incredibly well done, and the entire cast was phenomenal. I highly encourage everyone to watch the film, it perfectly balanced real, current issues while remaining a really fun film.Margot Robbie blew the role of Barbie out of the water, and Ryan Gosling as Ken was absolute perfection. Their interactions had me (and the theatre) absolutely dying. I can't wait to watch this movie over and over again!"
"This was a very fun, very engaging premise. I don't know if I'd call it groundbreaking, since it's a little derivative of Toy Story and Extra Guy, but this definitely works. The scenery and cast are great, and the movie bristles with energy.I just wish they kept this a little more light-hearted and a little less preachy. There are countless movies that lament victimhood and discrimination, and countless movies that showcase estranged parents and children magically reuniting through remarkable events. But how many great comedies are there these days? How about, for once, just keeping things light and entertaining? (The patriarchy? Seriously?)Regardless, I think most of the audience loved it, and I think most of the women wanted to stand up and cheer during the Mom's big speech. It's a visual feast with just enough laughs and a lot of star power, and you will probably be glad you went."
"Walked out during intermission.Visually, a fantastic job. Big props to the art and costume crew. Barbie Land was incredibly well made. The colors and the lighting in the film were on point.Not a bad idea for the plot, but the movie itself didn't care about the plot.Execution... You may as well get a hot pink piece of paper and a bright yellow pen, write ""Men are bad. Patriarchy is bad. Women are good. Unless they're really attractive, in which case they're also bad."" and read it aloud over and over and over again for 2 hours.The trailer made it seem like this would be a sort of movie that hasn't really been made since the mid-2000s which is a fun (""fun"" being the keyword) adventure with silly/supernatural elements to it. Sillly is me for thinking that that could happen in 2023..."
"Who would have thought that a film about Barbie would be one of the most original, fresh film of recent years.There are so many positives of Barbie. First of all, the cast is brilliant. They work very well and are perfect for their roles, specifically Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling (Oscar worthy in my opinion). A special mention to Michael Cera though for being spot on with his character.It's funny but also unexpectedly touching and really showcases the problems with modern day society in an inventive way.There was also surprises that were good and suited the narrative.Some criticisms are it's drags in certain scenes and it's definitely not for everyone but I guess that's cinema for you.Barbie is worth the watch!Edit: actually watched it for a second time and it's just a fun movie with really detailed set designs and cleverly thought out mannerisms."
"I'm a huge fan of Barbie, so when I heard there was a movie coming out, I was beyond excited & I certainly wasn't disappointed when I got to see it!The cast are incredible & all seem to bounce off of each other, the story was funny but also heartwarming at the same time, and the attention to detail was marvellous, in true Barbie fashion.One thing I really enjoyed was how it managed to pay tribute to so many different variations of Barbie, shout out to Weird Barbie! (We all had a weird Barbie!)Overall the film was truly a pleasure to watch & I just wish I could go to Barbie-Land, someone get me some Rollerblades please?"
"Ruth Handler, the inventor of Barbie,had a vision of a grown-up doll that little girls could love. In Barbie's world, everything is perfect, not messy and unpredictable like in the real world. You can dress her and play with her in whatever fantasy you want . In a long scene, Mattel executives are chasing the now human Barbie to get her ""back in the box"" acknowledging its patriarchal structure. Is designed to keep women second class. It does mention but glosses over its role in pushing Handler out of the company, supposedly for tax
violations. One critic noted that Mattel mentions itself no less than 35 times during the film. That said, there are some hysterically funny bits that will appeal particualrly to those of us over 60 years old.I thought Ryan Gosling was miscast as Ken. But Margot Robbie as Barbie was spot on."
"I think Barbie has always been about women empowerment and I'm glad there's a Barbie movie that doesn't tiptoe around it to spare feelings. This movie was not marketed towards kids, it was clearly meant for adults who grew up with Barbie. It's an important message and it was told well. The cinematography was also incredible. Loved the costumes, the casting, everything about it. Margot played a literal perfect Barbie. I loved the scene where she was supposed to be ""ugly"" and the narrator made a joke about Margot being the wrong person to cast if you wanted to make an ugly scene with her. Ryan gosling also have an amazing performance as Ken. Even when he was being a douche he still came across lovable."
"Was thrilled at start. What with all the pinks and blues and wow the reference to "" Planet of the Apes"" and ""Thus spake Zarathustra"". Somehow Greta or the writer did not know how to proceed after the Ken takeover and ended it all with almost a Christian sermon, however feminist it may sound and gave an American ending of all's well. Had expected more.The actors were great. And after the overall hype of Barbieheimer, and of course having seen the Heimer part of it before it was insufficient for me to give a better score. Don't get me wrong it's good if you want to have a good laugh and not really go out with something to chew on."
"I am a big fan of Greta Gerwig but not a Barbie fan. I got excited by all the promo but didn't know what to expectThe movie exceeded my expectations so much. It was fun and absurdist but also profound.The depth in the movie is the perfect level - it doesn't go too far and still feels fun and playful but still does deep explorations. It's also just really funny and clever and campy in the best way.I loved the costuming, the set design, the cinematography and the acting. I was skeptical about Ryan Gosling as Ken but his performance was so good! Margot Robbie was perfect as well. This movie was so fun and so creative and interesting."
"Barbie is a film that revolves around fun and enjoyment. The story centers on our titular character, Barbie, in her world full of pink, numerous other Barbies and Kens, unique rules, and a repetitive daily routine. The movie overflows with laughter, clever remarks, musical numbers, dazzling sets, existential crises, and much more.Margot Robbie, portraying Barbie, and Ryan Gosling, playing Ken, thoroughly embodied their roles to the fullest. As the main character in her world, Barbie is admired by everyone and sought after for attention. She must adhere to the ""Stereotypical Barbie"" image with flawless perfection, which can become exhausting over time. On the other hand, Ken serves as the placeholder character for the public, and with his dry humor, he delivers the majority of laughs throughout the film, showcasing his unwavering adoration for Barbie.Director Greta Gerwig, known for her unique storytelling, showcases her creativity once again in Barbie. The dialogue is woven in a way that allows for multiple interpretations, enabling Barbie to discuss her own world and even extend beyond it. The movie transcends the boundaries of a typical comedy at times and addresses issues that resonate in our own world.The bold choice of including a reference to '2001: A Space Odyssey' before the actual start sets an enthralling mood. The film initially feels like an episode from the Twilight Zone, with the repeating day trope, but gradually reveals something amiss. These daring choices elevate Barbie from being just another comedy movie to a film with a deliberate vision.Barbie slightly teeters on the edge of delivering patriarchal messages, especially towards the end, but it manages to steer clear of crossing the line. As one of the original feminist icons since her creation in 1959, certain types of comments were inevitable. The movie addresses these issues with eloquence, all while remembering its primary purpose is to entertain and offer an escape to a fictional world.The marketing strategy for Barbie is nothing short of brilliant. Pairing it with Oppenheimer, a drastically different film, for a double feature is a stroke of genius. Viewers have the choice to immerse themselves first in the bubbly and joyful world of Barbie, followed by the thought-provoking story of Oppenheimer. The success of this marketing approach is evident in the box office results, as many attendees opted for both screenings, turning it into a global film festival with two back-to-back films.The production design, as showcased in the dazzling trailers, is impeccable, packed with intricate details, easter eggs, various era Barbies and Kens, and more. The commitment put into curating these elements from different years and presenting them in an engaging manner is commendable.Barbie arrives at an interesting time, with both writers and actors on strike, and Hollywood on the verge of temporary closure. However, the combination of Barbie and Oppenheimer offers audiences a choice and a break from the usual superhero or unnecessary sequel movies. Barbie delivers abundant laughter, lively music, outstanding performances, and takes viewers on an immensely enjoyable journey."
"Barbie begins in a bubble-gum-coloured world of fun, fashion and perfection. Although Barbie is played by dozens of actors, 'Stereotypical Barbie' is played by Margot Robbie. Perfection in Barbie land doesn't last long though, as Barbie must travel to the real world to solve her sudden existential crisis. She meets both friends and foes along the way.As Barbie and her new girl gang return to Barbie Land, they are horrified to see that it is now renamed 'Kendom', after Ken (Ryan Gosling) who initially tagged along with Barbie has discovered the patriarchy of the real world and wants to be seen as more than 'just Ken'.With a star-studded cast full of cameos, Barbie's Margot Robbie is stunning, and I think the perfect choice for the title role. On a side note, it was nice to hear her not doing a Boston/New York accent for once. Ryan Gosling however took me out of the Ken fantasy. Character-wise he was great, but I see Ken as more of a Travis Van Winkle or Trevor Donovan type. Goslings' portrayal of Ken looked a bit sleazy, and the bleach-blonde hair did him no favours.There is a lot of lore and fun easter eggs throughout the film that both young and old can recognize, and even if you don't have a history of playing with Barbies (which I cannot confirm or deny that I did), there is a sense of nostalgia too.Bonus points for the phenomenal set and costume design, and a killer soundtrack too! I'd be disappointed if this film isn't up for any major awards for the above-mentioned.Barbie was super fun! It's also a movie that can be watched for many years to come and still seem current and relevant.#barbie #barbiethemovie."
"This is actually very close to a great movie. It deserves your time and money at the theatres. Remember Lego Movie? How no one was expecting anything from it, labelling it as a cash grab? And it actually turned out to be a thoughtful, clever comedy? This movie is just as good.This is a fun, over the top, laugh out loud comedy that manages to communicate a very necessary message. I loved how much fun it had in doing that. It used comedy as a tool to prove its point. It's not easy guys. Making a satire itself is not easy, let alone turning Barbie into a good movie.The over-the-top way this movie made fun of sexism was hilariously genius. It reminded me of ""Don't Look Up"". That was another movie that deliberately made its characters unrealistically unlikeable to prove its point using humour. There are dialogues in this movie where I was like, it's funny but yeah, it needed to be said. The way this movie constantly made jabs at where gender equality stands at the moment, was genius.Everyone in this movie is having so much fun. The actors, all of them gave hilarious performances. Ryan Gosling, especially, was so funny. His character was so integral to the main theme of this movie.This movie is so self aware, that I wouldn't have been surprised if a character just mentioned the opening weekend battle with Oppenheimer.It has a few problems though. While the way the main theme of this movie is concluded was more or less perfect, I thought the way Barbie's character was concluded didn't make much sense and was sort of contradictory. And given that it's a very over the top comedy, some scenes do stretch a bit too much. It can get a bit too preachy at times too.But honestly, I had a great time. I would highly recommend watching this in theatres. In fact, my entire hall was laughing throughout the movie."
"Acting: 6/10
Cinematography: 7/10
Writing: 6/10
Pacing: 6/10
Overall: 6.25/10
Audience: 12+Acting: Great performance by Margot Robbie. Ryan Gosling didn't meet up to that standard however that is more due to the script he was given rather than himself. Nice to see cameos from Rob Brydon and Asim Chaudhry.Cinematography: Set in both 'Barbie Land' and the 'Real World', the lighting remained saturated and vivid throughout the film, embodying the standard lightheartedness of a fantasy comedy film. The scenes in the 'Real World' were less vibrant than 'Barbie Land', creating a strong wall that separates the troubles of the 'Real World' and 'Barbie Land'.Writing: With the aim to spread awareness about gender quality, Barbie did not meet this objective. Unison wasn't able to be built between men and women as the film took the approach to put the genders against eachother, making it a competitive fight to overthrow one another.Pacing: Despite being 2 hours long, the film felt fairly quick but had some sequences which loses the audiences attention.Audience: Although the traditional barbie dolls are targeted towards young children, this film is applicable to persons aged 12 and over due to the political and social subjects of the plotline."
"The movie has a very clever intro, a charming set-up filled with sight gags, and some hilarious lines (especially those spoken by the narrator - Helen Mirren).However, it's essentially about a town of marginalized and emasculated men (the Kens) and when they discover they are only disaffected props, they create a toxic patriarchy (although we never see how they do it). The Barbies then manipulate the Kens, using feminine wiles and playing dumb, to coerce the Kens into a war with each other to distract them back into submission.Adding to a magnum of plot holes, and an ending that takes WAY too long, is a weird 'Pinocchio' twist when Barbie only becomes satisfied with her existence when she gets a vagina.This film panders to a pseudo-feminist audience. If you want to see a film where feminism is funny and wins in the end, see Legally Blonde."
"I had no idea what to expect, but the trailers made me smile. Every after the seeing the trailers the movie was so much more weird and wonderful and pink than I'd even imagined. I laughed so hard. There is also a sweet message about the pressures of life and society and gender roles without being preachy. It feels like a message of kindness to ourselves and to others. I now know that I am Kenough.The writing of this film was brilliant. It could have been a strange and tacky film; but instead it reminded us of the endless possibilities of stories and imaginations. The music, costumes, sets and actors all were the perfect pink sprinkles on top."
"Synopsis: Barbie (Played by Margot Robbie) suddenly starts to notice that she is slowly turning away from being the stereotypical Barbie doll with a few changes happening to her. This forces Barbie to discover the real world as well as herself and her purpose as a doll.This film is directed by Greta Gerwig and written by both Greta Gerwig and her partner Noah Baumbach. In case you did not know, Greta Gerwig is the writer and director of films like Lady Bird (2017) and Little Woman (2018). Both these films are astonishing in terms of the screenplay and dialogues. In addition, Noah Baumbach wrote, directed, and produced Marriage Story (2019) as well as Frances Ha (2012) that had Greta Gerwig as a lead actress role and a writer in the film. Both those films also stood out for mostly the screenplay that is very deep and realistic in terms of the story and dialogues. Therefore, the expectations of Barbie are very high especially that we are talking about having those big names as the filmmakers behind this film. However, the results are unfortunately not near their previous films, especially in-terms of the screenplay.Barbie is a film that is in my opinion targeted mostly for adults. It is like the director described, ""a party for everyone, and everyone is invited"". But, young kids (especially today's new young generation) will feel like it's not the type of party for them. As well as the jokes that feel like mostly adults will get them, especially that some of them include some inappropriate language or idea.The biggest flaws of the film are its most important parts, and the main story mainly evolves around them. Therefore, because they weren't done well, the film lost its balance at most times. Barbie touched on the topic of how a relationship between a mother and a daughter can be and the stages it goes through. This is being portrayed in the weakest way ever and that's due to many reasons mainly for not giving it enough time and discussing it very briefly. Therefore, no emotions or connections are created between both the mother's character and the daughter's character with audience members. As well as, using a young actress to portray the role of the daughter that can be played by someone else with better acting skills. Without spoiling, but, a shorter sequence near the end of the film between 2 irrelevant characters, was able to touch audience members' hearts in terms of that topic, better than the characters of the mother and daughter with their sequences that we spent nearly most of the film with trying to connect with their relationship. A huge aspect that had helped in making this sequence a successful one is Billie Eilish's song ""What was I made for"" that was playing in the background during it. I an interview wit Billie, she goes by explaining how this song tells what she went through and felt in an. This can be heard in the song's lyrics and Billie's voice that makes this scene and song very real and original and goes so well with that scene in particular.Another huge flaw is the portrait of the Mattel corporation with its executives, mainly played by Will Farrell as the CEO of Mattel. Very weak, and cringe at times that just made me rather want to go back to the BarbieLnad sequences or Barbie and Ke sequences.Margot Robbie is just phenomenal as Barbie exactly like what everyone expected her to be. She proves herself as an actress that can be added to the list of one of the most significant actresses in the modern time. She is able to play most roles very well and that can be seen from her previous roles like Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad (2016), Sharon Tate in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), or previously in Babylon (2022) as Nillie Lorey. On the other hand, Ryan gosling as Ken is shining in this film. I think most of the scenes that I laughed out loud in, where mostly because of jokes performed by Gosling with the help of his acting skills using facial expressions and body language that suits Ken's character and behaviour perfectly. Simu Lui proves himself in this film that he is better in comedy films rather than serious action drama films. I enjoyed his comedic Ken role here more tHan i enjoyed seeing him being a superhero and trying to play a character like Shang-Chu in marvel's Shang-Chi (2021).Greta really uses all the memes and trends that people have created in regards to the Barbie movie on the different social media platforms, and uses them as the main core behind the comedy aspect of the film. These little details are what make Greta's films all different from each other. Also, this is what makes Barbie a film made for the fans specifically. For instance, everyone have seen the meme that is a picture of the gang from Goodfellas wearing suits and looking very fresh, with a caption on it that says: ""4 tickets for the Barbie movie please"". This can clearly be seen in the film as many jokes had a similar idea that evolves around those jokes that you would end to your buddy on Tik Tok or Insta. One of my favourite lines said by Ryan Gosling's Ken is: ""Every night is boys' night"".Finally, props to all production design, custom design and editing team that was able to portray BarbieLand and all the different Barbie and Ken versions exactly how they were suppose to look with their pink and colourful world and customs which is a thing that I personally was worried about. The results are more than ""KENough""My rating is 8/10Watched on July 20th, 2023

"First impressions of the movie where mixed. The script is pretty much garbage. It sends a solid message about equality while somehow does the exact opossite.It tries to create a society where men and women are at the same level and all bodies and races have the same value but also does the opposite making sometimes girls look much inferior than men and men inferior than women.The movie is about laughing at how basic, stupid and ignorant the fan base of the movie really is. If you went to the theater wearing all pink and well dressed then you are what I'm talking about.I must say it was a fun movie that made me laugh at some points. It was so fun to see how ignorant the people watching this movie are that made me also laugh and be worried about how the society has fallen. I went to see the movie making a double session after seeing Oppenheimer so that may be why I notice the difference about the audience.If you are a girl and you laughed a bit too much then maybe you should go and search for a psychiatrist because if you like being made fun off then you have some problems.Basically, if you are a guy taking over a girl then you are bad. If you are a girl taking over a guy then it's all good. The movie supports the extreme left, politically btw.At the same time it also teaches guys and girls that they don't need each other and can live by their own. It's a journey about finding yourself and what it means to be a guy or a girl. It tries to take out stereotypes by saying all bodies are perfect but when Barbie gets cellulitis it's then she is ugly and wants go back to be perfect and to the usual stereotypes. Also let's include fat barbie and paralytic barbie but for some reason let's not include fat Ken or paralytic Ken and just make them all gorgeous and fit, clearly not body-shaming guys...If you are wondering why I haven't spoken about any of the plot, well... that's because there isn't one besides vibes and ideologies.I was also surprised in the good way for not having woke characters or members of the lgbtqi+ comunity. If there is a movie for it, it's this one but I'm glad they did not force any of that.It's sad to see that almost all the audience just went there to show off their pink outfits, tell everyone they have watched the movie by taking pics before or after the movie and to stay on their phones instead of watching it. I came out of the movie worried about where society is going and I think that was not supposed to happen."
"The movie is fun, silly, and entertaining. Saw this in the theater which is the first time I've been in one since 2020 most people including myself for dressed up. Everyone interacted with the movie by cheering and clapping throughout. After the movie was over everyone was so uplifted that chatting in the lobby was actually a thing between strangers. That's a lot to get from a little movie about a small doll. I told my husband on the way home we will have to find a karaoke version of a song that Ken sings but not necessarily the one that Barbie does. Will Ferrell was unexpected and as always completely enjoyable."
"Barbie is a story of a Barbie gaining sentience when her owner hits a bad time affecting her life in BarbieLand. She develops human feelings and tries to come to term with it by meeting her humans whilst forced to string along her Ken. Ken sees the real world, he finds more things that can be of his benefit, MEANWHILE Barbie falls into much deeper bad time. Ruckus happens as the Mattel Company AND Barbie tries to make thing back to what it is used to be AND BECOMES A DASH before things go to late.A very well conceptualized film about Barbie and her plight of finding the meaning of life. I think this is a great idea BUT clearly there are things that can be better.Loved mostly its darker and dramatic moments. Gerwig wrestling the ideas of Barbie both in the Feminist context and the how the public sees it at large was a masterclass. It is where the story really held its landing. YOU could see how Barbie both as an idea and a product, comes to term of how she affected the culture or just how the culture at large move ahead from it. The scene with Ruth and Barbie is so well placed in the script.But for the mixed parts of the film, I felt more mixed with the comedic aspect of the film. The script was fun but verbally the schtick can be quite repetitive. It also was not that witty AND pass quirkiness as such. It was not. Visually, its funnier though but a lot of the jokes can be a hit or miss. I do not think Gerwig understood HOW TO END it with the Ken's BUT practically its her nodding the first wave Feminist, by them maybe trying to get the fundamental rights first before going all out but without any repercussion for the Ken Movement.I also did not like how anti-climactic the Un-Kendollification of the Barbie's was. The grand standing gesture was just repeated too much, that it kinda loses a lot of its power but I guess it was to make sense of the plans for the Ken's afterward.Acting wise definitely, I think Gosling did the best with the comedic material, with Robbie excelling in more dramatic portion of the film. Not as impressed with the others except maybe for McKinnon's weird Barbie and Issa Rae as President Barbie, which both has moments but too small to really be noteworthy.I think it is definitely overhyped AND was meant for children BUT Gerwig did great with all the hoopla she had faced to make this film, especially with its themes of Female Identity AND Barbie herself, the portion of the film I think it had its best success. Robbie deserves the accolades as she brings to life Barbie. Gosling was also good as the very much confused Ken. 3.5/5."
"I watched this over the weekend and I can say downright that all the media attention and acclaim this movie has received is all truthful. This is a dark-gritty, wholesome and unconventionally humorous film that creates a dark and twisted yet fantastical and feminine adjunction towards the brand and the key themes it lays upon, themes of feminism, social roles, corporate greed, aging, legacies and divine intervention. It reads like a piece from epic poetry, as if the gods themselves had come down and made it. This is definitely the movie of 2023, and the wide range of actors just make it more convincing, I had my boyfriend drooling over ryan reynolds for the duration of the movie and I loved Margot Robbie's take on barbie. Loved this movie."
"Directed and co-written by Greta Gerwig. A runtime of one hour and fifty-four minutes. With a PG-13 rating.Narrated throughout by Helen Mirren. Starring Margot Robbie playing the world-famous Mattel toy company character ""Barbie"", specifically ""Stereotypical Barbie"". Also starring her playmate/partner and fellow toy ""Ken"", specifically ""Beach Ken"" played by Ryan Gosling.Life in ""Barbie Land"" is magnificent. Every morning is spectacular. With ""President Barbie"" played by Issa Rae, ""Doctor Barbie played by Alexandra Shipp, and ""Physicist Barbie"" played by Margot Robbie doppelgänger Emma Mackey to name a few.With many different ""Kens"" played by John Cena, Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir who's playing ""Bob Marley in next year's biopic, and Ncuti Gatwa to name a few. Oh, and you can't forget about ""Allan"" played by Michael Cera.Every day is magical until it's not. After ""Stereotypical Barbie"" started getting some weird thoughts. She is advised by ""Weird Barbie"" played by SNL Alum Kate McKinnon to go to the real world and find her human.Not wanting to leave her side ""Beach Ken"" hitches along for the ride. But once in the real world, they will learn new harsh realities. Between ""Stereotypical Barbie"" now adult human ""Gloria"" played by America Ferrera and her teenage daughter ""Sasha"" played by Ariana Greenblatt things are far from how life is in ""Barbie Land"".With ""Beach Ken"" as well getting a heavy dose of reality. These new revelations jeopardize life in ""Barbie Land"" as a whole. It will take everyone including ""Mattel Ceo"" played by Will Ferrell to fix everything that's been forever altered.""Barbie"" from the start was said to be different. Co-Writer and director Greta Gerwig said this wasn't going to be a typical ""Barbie"" film and that the viewer will be surprised. She couldn't be more right.This film appealed to little girls and women as a whole. It was deep. It touched on emotions and feelings all women feel, have felt, or will feel at some point in their life. Many women cried while watching the film because of how hard some of the points in the film hit.It wasn't all serious. It also wasn't all pink and rainbows too. It had jokes that everyone could laugh at while also having jokes that only the older viewer would get. It made sure to not take itself too seriously but also have points to make you think. I laughed throughout the film. It was really funny.The ""Kens"" were hilarious morons. Both ""Ken"" and ""Barbie"" made fun of themselves it also had points in it that were referring to some of the stuff going on in today's climate.It was fantastically done with a lot of satire. Even the overly silly stuff made a way to make it somewhat funny. Don't judge this book by the cover you will be highly surprised. So many great actors throughout that added to the film. Ryan Gosling knew the assignment.All ages, genders, and nongenders will enjoy this film. With obvious points paying homage to women. A fun film I enjoyed way more than I thought I would. Expect a lot of different emotions with some hard-hitting realities as well. Once again I have to give a shout-out to the director/co-writer for hitting the mark. Because that's a big task to ask.This was an excellent film weekend with
""Oppenheimer"" and ""Barbie"". With their respective writer/director doing an amazing job doing both. I give this film four mor fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥 but I expect most women to rate this five mor fires. Which makes perfect sense.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin

"First, no actress on earth could have done this role other than Margot Robie. She's as if Barbie came to life (spoiler alert-she does). Margot is incredible in this. From the 2001 inspired opening (which had me laughing my head off) to when she's depressed and appears to be Barbie left behind by a little girl. The stiff legs, the arms, the way she rolls over-hysterical. The rest of the cast, especially America Ferrara, carry the story well and no one, no one is laughing at being in the movie. There are many, many Barbie related easter eggs, including one my wife pointed out to me: The interior of America's car is the same color as one of the original Barbie cars. The movie is fun without being preachy and if you pay attention-you may just learn something. One last thing, the great Dame Helen Mirren narrates! Go see it and have fun."
"The most surprising thing about Barbie is that the joke gets old so quickly. Then, after it stops beating the audience over the head with its obviousness, it settles into a self-assured groove. It's the rare case in which the third act is actually better than the first two. The jokes land harder once it sheds the need to be all things at once - a twist neatly mirroring the film's central crisis moment.As it plays out, the first half of Barbie is surprisingly drab. It's a feat of production and winking self reference that threatens to turn into a painful civics lesson and a generic every-genre-all-at-once lecture. It's not nearly as weird or jarring as it needs to be, and ultimately, the Barbie world is as lifeless as the titular character.But then, something interesting happens: Barbie actually starts landing some punches. It's no accident that a turn happens with the introduction of a fairly obvious twist - the introduction of a strange character played by Rhea Perlman. And Perlman is the perfect actress to fill such a role. She's small, unglamorous, and crone-ish, consistently cast as either a venomous tough or as a matronly sieve. In Barbie, she's a literal chorus, and her existence in the film suggests a knowing concession between the Corporate Barbie toy empire and the relationship that so many women have with her, and themselves.These are the topics that have long churned in Noah Baumbach's films combined with topics that have defined Gerwig's features, yet the movie doesn't work like anything the two have accomplished separately. Barbie feels like Ladybird by way of The Life Aquatic, and when it allows itself to go full-blown existential, it manages a sort of cinematic brilliance that it's rival blockbuster (Oppenheimer, of Oppenheimer, looming so large over everyone's attempt at pretension) simply can't manage. The film has deep flaws, but heart is not one of them.It's a magical thing to see Margot Robbie cry, and while her performance really isn't particularly consequential to the plot, it does present emotional heft to a screenplay that is both dullard and brilliant by design. Robbie, like Charlize Theron, is a beautiful blonde archetypal actress who just happens to be profoundly intelligent and intense, even when the film literally mentions exactly how we are not supposed to look at her as ""average"" while begging us to see her as just that. It's a neat trick to pull off a genuinely flattering disrobing of stereotypical beauty. It's a joke Robbie is in on, and a passive exclamation point that co-star Ryan Gosling owns.I like watching actors having fun onscreen. I actually never expected to experience this in Barbie, especially when it shoehorns in less-than interesting roles for Will Farrell and Kate McKinnon and quickly exhausts its post-subtlety messaging. Farrell and McKinnon are supposed to be two anarchical characters. Both fall flat. We've seen it all before, and here they lack any acidity whatsoever. Their roles feel tired after countless Toy Storys and Lego Movies treading on the politics of child/adult expectations of reality. They almost seem like add-ons from the corporate execs they lampoon - especially troubling in that McKinnon is supposed to represent anarchy. But Robbie and America Ferrera eat up the screen, both inhabiting a particular idea that seems to have genuinely spring from Gerwig's best instincts. There are scenes that - in an overwrought and exaggerated cinematic world - seem to actually exist in real life. To get caught by surprise seemed impossible as the first act ground to a halt.Barbie is a little too blunt for its own good, which strangely ends up being a good thing. At just under two hours, the bludgeoning messaging stops being funny and you feel the fatigue that we're supposed to understand is the source of Barbie's angst. In that, the ending isn't a reach so much as a confident nod to where Gerwig has taken the audience. If it's rare to see a actresses having fun in a Hollywood film, it's especially rare to see a female director genuinely flourishing by being just exactly who she is."
"On the surface it's a fun and bubbly movie. Lots of cool colors, cool design, fun styles and music. Barbie world is pretty cool and makes you want to be a part of it. Unfortunately this isn't really a Barbie movie.In terms of accuracy they've changed a lot of things about Barbie and what Barbie is supposed to be about.When you dig a bit deeper (you actually don't have to dig at all if you're wise and have an eye for subliminal messages, social cues, and agendas) you quickly it's mainly a movie about misandry.Basically ""men are dumb and bad"" and ""women should pursue career"" and they wrapped the whole premise in a giant Barbie flashy skin. It's quite concerning how much damage this movie will actually do to our society because many impressionable kids and young adults will watch this and be influenced by it without even being aware of it."
"Sorry for the title, militants, please don't cancel me! (seriously, jokes aside)
While the movie is good, I anticipate a lot of memes about overblown cancellations, prejudice, and patriarchy... which I think get a lot of attention from the script. More than was needed.The movie is fun and has great performances, hats off to Margot Robbie, but, Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu's Kens stole every scene. The rest of the acting and cast is just fine, I don't believe I've seen a single bad performance.For a particularly comedy film, I feel like my session lacked laughs. Throughout the film, I laugh in very few scenes, but I also understand that they are directed at children and so on. (ignoring the last part, there are some jokes with double meanings, nothing that children would understand, watch it calmly with the little ones!)...but I have to admit, the movie didn't get me. Actually, it was one of the few times that I almost fell asleep in the cinema. This time, me and my company, we yawned so much that we started to cry from sleep, but we didn't pass out. The reason i'm writing this last part is because i can understand the 1/10 and the 10/10 reviews... it just hits people in different ways. The only bad thing this movie did is make me sick of the color pink. Seriously, the theater was packed with people wearing only pink. Even suits and formal wear, I know it's because of the memes... but things get out of hand ,_,"
"I continuously laughed and cried the whole movie. The acting is impeccable. There are so many small details and visual gags that I'm sure there were things I missed because I was laughing so much. It's clear the writers are intimately familiar with doll play, and how Barbies are actually used by children.Special shout-out to America Ferrara in this respect. Obviously Robbie and Gosling are amazing, but Ferrera brings the ""human woman"" perspective with enthusiasm and warmth. Her delivery for certain monologues is achingly relatable, and acknowledges issues facing both women and Barbie in a way that validates what women may or may not feel without judgement, just camaraderie.The movie is self aware, the auteur lens making it feel like you're watching alongside someone. I cannot imagine watching the movie and feeling alone- Greta gerwig has brought you into the fold, acknowledging your role as audience but also as witness.This is most apparent in the scenes of the movie that other reviewers have deemed feminist. The whole point of Barbie (the movie and the doll's origins) are to make women feel seen, feel valued and to show that you can be you without collecting things to validate your identity.I absolutely loved every minute of this film and I am so happy that it was made. Thank you to everyone involved in this project, you truly created movie magic.I am unsurprised that there are negative reviews for this movie, as some people do not enjoy looking at the truth head on. Suspend any need for Complacent Barbie, and embrace the wonderful magic of this movie.(barely a spoiler) the second to the last scene of Barbie made me feel the way I did when watching Lovecraft Country, episode 7 (titled ""I am."") if you need a dose of that energy before you can see the movie again, I absolutely recommend it. No need to watch the whole series if it's not your bag."
"I finally plucked up the courage and wore my usual all black clothes as I braved the hordes of pink wearing women to watch Barbie the latest release from director Great Gerwig. The film opens with a voice over from Helen Mirren telling us how Barbie changed the doll business, no longer did young girls just have dolls that were encouraging them to stay in the kitchen now they had barbie who could have any career with the change of an outfit. Straight away this should tell you about the gender politics of this film but more on that later. We then cut to Barbieland where everything is plastic and fantastic that is until one day Barbie out loud says do you ever think about death? (Is there not a therapist barbie?). From there starts an adventure where Barbie and Ken travel to the real world, barbie in search of her owner to find the source of her new found depressive thoughts and Ken well in search of Barbies heart.This film is a hard one to unpick as it's just chaos, there's so much going on all the time, so much so that the slower moments act as nice breathers for the audience. There's dance sequences, action sequences, jokes, gender politics and somewhere in here there's the typical Barbie plot that you might presume this film would have but it's covered with loads of other stuff. The thing I'm most torn on with this film is that I want to praise Gerwig for creating a Barbie film that no one would have predicted while at the same time I can't help wondering if I personally would have enjoyed it more had it been more generic. I'm always talking about how films should be more creative and yet this is the question this film has me asking myself. It's just different and it definitely isn't a kids film, a young girl sat a couple of rows behind me had to keep asking her mum what was going on and I don't blame her as if I was 6,7,8 years old I wouldn't have had a clue. This film seems to be aimed at women Greta's age which is a surprise to me as I thought she was in her late twenties for some reason but you can Google her actual age if you wish to know. Now I know her actual age some of the more older niche references to bands and films etc make more sense and I think it's women that are a similar age to her that she's trying to appeal to here.That brings me onto the films central theming which is its gender politics. It's a film that's about women and for women and in that it does a great job, I think for its target audience it could be an impactful and empowering piece of art. That being said however if you're a pre teen girl or a man you might not get the full emotional impact of this film and I feel that's a bit of a missed opportunity. If this film had eased up on the gender politics at times I think it could have appealed to a wider audience and in doing so may have been able to spread the films message further but I think it's largely ended up falling on death ears to those who aren't in its target audience. It's a shame because the film has an important message to share about equality but it's one that men need to get onboard with as much as women to bring about any real change.By the way, for a film that's supposed to be telling women to be who they are and challenge the patriarchy why has a trend been created for women to wear pink to this film considering it's one of the most commonly associated colours with women?Overall I'm not the target audience for this film but I had a good time nonetheless, it's not one I'll be hurrying back too with haste though."
"It's weird yet fun movie! It keeps getting better by the minutes, had a good portion of fun but also a few emotional moments.It's not made for everyone but try and keep a clear mind while watching it!The casting choice were sublime and each Barbie, Ken and even Alan nailed there performances.The few cameos were also pretty fun, and with a lovely touch at moments.Some scenes were a bit dragged out but because of the characters it kinda felt like i was okey with it.It has it ups and downs but it was mostly entertaining and i think that was it's main goal and they succeeded in that.If you are a Barbie fan you'll definitely have a blast!"
"""Thus Spake Zarabarbie"" - that's the opening message as narrated by Dame Helen Mirren who gives us a potted history of the doll - from it's origins as an inanimate plaything of young girls to it's current status as an empowering conduit for young girls to emerge into society as uninhibited and aspirational beings with only the sky as the limit. Well, that's the philosophy in Margot Robbie's ""Barbieland"". A sterile sort of environment that lives it's life along the lines of a pink ""Groundhog Day"". Men? Well yes, there are - as embodied by the tanned, rippled and toned ""Ken"" (Ryan Gosling) but they are very much the in-app purchase in this world, with little purpose aside from augmenting a ""Barbie"". Strangely, one morning, the stereotypical ""Barbie"" finds she has lost some of her charm! She is flat footed, her endlessly elysian existence is fraying at the edges? What do do? See ""Weird Barbie"" (Emerald Fennell) and seek her sagely advice. That, however, she doesn't like. She must enter into the real world and find whoever is supposed to be playing with her - clearly not an happy girl - and see if she can cheer her up and restore the equilibrium. En route, she finds that her ever devoted ""Ken"" will join her and their arrival in the big city introduces both to a bewildering world of sexists, misogynists and cynics. The latter best exemplified by ""Sasha"" - her somewhat disenchanted owner. When the boss of Mattel (Will Farrell) discovers her escape, he mobilises the whole of his organisation to get her back in her box whilst an equally disillusioned but newly engaged ""Ken"" heads back to his home realising that maybe the men don't have to live quite such understudy lives. Can she elude her pursuers long enough to befriend ""Sasha"", her much less cyclical mother ""Gloria"" (America Ferrera) and then get home before both of her world's are alien to her? This is good fun, this. Gosling is a talented actor who can also churn out a decent power ballad (there are a few) and there is the oddest of chemistries here between him and an very much on-form Robbie who puts her heart and her soul (and loads of joyous/bemused facial expressions) into this role. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have written a witty script that pitches the naive and the innocent in with the venal and the observational. It swipes at all things sexist - and not just from the woman's perspective either - and though it does ridicule the restrictions society has put on the historical progression of women through the ranks of corporate America, it does so in a positive and enjoyable satirical manner. Will Ferrell - I can take him or leave him - is really only adequate as the epitome of the male dominated company structure but there is quite a nice set of scenes with Rhea Perlman (for ever ""Carla"" from ""Cheers!"") who portrays the inventor - if that is the word - of the whole ""Barbie"" concept, and who knits it all nicely together towards the end. Don't be a snob about this, get yourself into a cinema and prepare to be entertained. Bergman it isn't, but an enjoyable evaluation and parody of 21st century life, opportunity and all things vacuous it certainly is."
"A fantastic fun summer movie! Barbie is not at all
What I thought it would be. We laughed through the entire movie. Margot Robbie is absolutely perfect as well as America Ferrera. Ryan Gosling plays ken so well with a great twist. The movie had a lot of laughs along with an amazing message. It's hard to be a women and Barbie really shares a perspective that I think most women feel everyday. This is an important show for both females and males to see. I went into the movie with no expectations and came out thrilled and wanting to see it again. I've seen a lot of film this summer and this was my favorite so far!"
"Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) wakes up everyday in a pink world with all the other Barbies who have all attained top societal roles as doctors, astronauts, the president etc all supported purely as accessories by a series of dumb Kens - including Ryan Gosling. Robbie's Barbie however starts thinking about things she shouldn't, including death, and seeks advice from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) who says that someone in the real world is having these ideas and she must go there and sort things out, which she tries to, accompanied by Gosling.Before I went to see this, I never really really understood what this was supposed to be about or what it was trying to say. Having now seen it and hopefully understood things a bit better there are elements that still confuse me a bit. Ok, the battle of the sexes is tackled very nicely with deft explanations around woman still clearly having a more difficult time in a modern world of supposed settled equality plus the distinction between reality and the need for fantasy is well played. However, whilst it appeared to make a lot of sense and told its tale well, I still left the cinema with a bit of a confused frown on my face as ultimately men and women still seem as bad as each other in their attempts to outdo each other - was that the idea? Still, I must say I thought it was on the whole fun and original film with 2 fine performances and Gerwig has cleverly brought the 2 worlds nicely together. I guess it really is a unique film and one I think I need to see again one day to check out everything I must have missed - most odd."
"The Barbie movie got a lot of buzz from critical praise but I was intrigued even before that because there were stories about how it had quite the journey through development. I don't know what the previous versions would have looked like but I wanted to start with how Greta Gerwig's version is structured. It would have been pretty easy to play to formula writing and developing the script, to just repackage a popular framework and insert Barbie with some different touches (paint it pink and glam it up a little). But the creative team wasn't content to do just that here, my favourite part of Barbie is the unconventional directions the plot shoots off in. Barbie coming to the real world could have been predicted but the parallel journey of Ken, Barbie bonding with Gloria and Sasha, the odyssey that the Mattel executives go on are so off-kilter and fresh. It's all firmly tongue-in-cheek as well, the movie is deliberately poking fun at both itself and the system (including the corporate owners of the Barbie brand Mattel). Is there the occasional misstep? Sure, but this movie was so rare that while I could have nitpicked and poked at inconsistencies, I didn't want to. Barbie encourages you strap in for a ride and I can forgive the occasional bump in the journey if you deliver the goods. With such a silly tone and some well-intentioned rhetoric, Barbie absolutely does that and more.In Barbie's debut, we travel to Barbieland, a candy coated toy-like version of reality that is perfectly curated to the needs of all the Barbies (and to a lesser extent all the Kens). The production design, costuming, sets, lighting are all dynamic and creative. The creative team does an excellent job of adding little touches to flesh out the world while maintaining the glossy veneer of the toys. The cars, the houses, the outfits are picture perfect and magnify how much money and effort clearly went into designing and creating this world. They use set dressing to great comedic effect too and it helps sell how strange and eerie coming to reality would be for our heroes.Margot Robbie is pulling double duty as both the star and a producer in this feature. Robbie is her typical excellent self here, she's what the movie is centred around but she isn't afraid to share the spotlight with some of the other heavy hitters in the cast. She's as advertised in Barbie, she's funny, dramatic and magnetic all in equal measure. Ryan Gosling is really going for it as Ken, he's also underrated as a comedic talent. The jokes are fairly simple here but his enthusiastic delivery is what sets his work apart. Some people have mentioned awards consideration, I wouldn't go that far but he's great and he showed up to work. My favourite performance actually came from America Ferrera as Gloria. She's got great chemistry with both her on-screen daughter Sasha (played by an also great Ariana Greenblatt) and Robbie. She's playing more the everywoman in the minefield that is the world today with a frenetic energy that totally fits. I also wanted to congratulate Rhea Perlman, Will Ferrell (in a very President Business-esque turn), Issa Rae and Alexandra Shipp for some excellent work in their respective supporting roles as well.Barbie has plenty to say and uses the platform effectively to get the message across. There's so much packed in here from how problematic it can be excelling as a woman in today's world, the fragility of the male psyche, how corporations flip-floppy attitude towards gender politics are based upon greed instead of the collective good etc. Depending on the scene, some of the material is delivered in a more subtle manner than in others but I was continually impressed by how the creative team was able to get the message across while weaving it into the movie without coming across as too heavy-handed. I'll also concede that I felt like they got 80-90% of the way there instead of the whole 100% (there's still an aftertaste of non-equality at the end). But I'll also concede that I'm not the target demographic here, I completely approve of the movie in its completed form and I'm all for what the message is trying to say (woman power, working through insurmountable obstacles bit by bit, getting in touch with yourself through introspection and acts of kindness, shape your own standards for beauty etc.)Barbie was a little uneven for me but I really enjoyed the overall package. Barbie is bold, vibrant, well-made and delightfully weird in the best of ways. The performances are great and I liked that despite it taking advantage of existing intellectual property, it stands out by being a self-contained story that doesn't hinge on a Mattel Cinematic Universe or suggest that there will be sequel after sequel. I want to tip my cap to Greta Gerwig and her team for subverting expectations and giving us an unconventional blockbuster experience. Go see Barbie in theatres if you get the chance."
"I regret that I allowed myself to be swept up by the Barbie hype.I'm sure it will resonate with the ladies.Gents, you can wait 'til it streams.It's just not nearly as clever as I'd hoping it'd be. Yes, I was fully expecting a message, but not one that would be hammered onto our heads.Zero subtlety and a deficiency of real wit.There was a moment in the film that held promise, re: Ken and the subject of masculinity, but it was squandered.This film is very fortunate for the Barbenheimer phenomenon, because I'm not sure word of mouth could have served it as well.I love me a chick flick - just not this one."
"I just watched Barbie, it wasn't offensively bad. It was just weak, and not funny. The feminist rant stuff is unapologetically there, not as frequent as some people are saying, it came across to me like content from an '80s female stand up comedienne, so nothing original, and very dated. The script is messy and doesn't make a lot of sense even regarding it's own internal logic.The ""empowerment"" stuff in it is very generic, a lot of the sentiment is kid's film-level ""just be yourself and like yourself"" thinking that applies to any person, but it's only the girls in the film that make these profound ""revelations"" as they are the creative gender and the guys (in Barbie land and the ""real"" world) are all cardboard cut-out airheads.The film is nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is, it's pretty shallow and light-weight and isn't going to leave lasting impact in pop culture, good or bad, pretty forgettable really. Kids of an impressionable age will most likely just be bored by it, and most older people will see it for the weak sauce it is."
"A Barbie movie helmed by Greta Gerwig starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling... what could possibly go wrong? Practically nothing it seems, as this movie is a complete knock out in every possible way.It is hilarious from start to finish with a sharply funny, meta, intelligent script that is matched by the masterfully executed physical comedy.The story is emotional and powerful and meaningful which I did not expect, but this proved to be such a vital and welcome part of the film.The entire cast is brilliant with outrageously camp performances from them all, but the highlights are the two leads. I can't think of two better people suited for the roles than Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. They both give perfectly flawless performances, filled with heart and humour and charisma. Will Ferrell is a scene-stealer with some hilarious comedy as you'd expect, and America Ferrera delivers a great performance with a lot of heart.The visuals are so fun from the sets through to the costumes. It is such a vibrant and colourful film that bursts with creativity, and to top it all off it has a superb soundtrack as well.If you were once a Barbie movie sceptic like me, then think again as it does not disappoint!"
"Barbie was the perfect combination of light weighted fun in Barbieland with greatly timed one-liners, other clever barbie-themed aspects of barbies reality vs 'the real world' and a deep (not so hidden) meaning behind modern society, the patriarchy and feminism.There could have been so many things done wrong in this movie that Barbie did right! The casting was incredible. Even Ryan Gosling, who I beforehand thought was too old, was great and obviously well chosen for this role. Margot Robbie as the literal star of the show was of course explicitly well cast and played barbie like a second skin.There is diversity, modern issues and a whole lot of fun, the whole theater was constantly giggling and laughing. I think Barbie is a movie that really shows modern issues in a casual way and would be an eye-opener to many people (admittedly, mostly men) on how society views women in day-to-day life."
"Barbie is a really fun movie that sets itself up with a lighthearted premise. The humor is self aware, the set design is immaculate, the actors are perfect for their roles. But eventually it turns itself into a feminist commentary on the patriarchy. This by itself isn't horrible, it's just quite heavy handed. I understand why they did it, Barbie as a concept has seen controversy in recent years and it would've sparked more controversy if they made a movie completely blind to it and not addressing it at all. But it's just.. not what you're looking for when you go see a Barbie film. In fairness, if they went the other route by simply nostalgia bating, I'm sure people would've called it hollow, money grabbing and meaningless. There's no way this movie could ever satisfy everyone. Personally I think the movie would've been better with a tad less social commentary and more focus on the whimsical storyline. Other than that, no qualms about the execution. This is still a really fun movie if you can handle a little political pandering."
"Ignore all of the salty toxic masculinity comments, this movie was perfect.Such a clever and witty script. Margot Robbie & Ryan Gosling played their roles flawlessly.It was so much fun and the references and narration were brilliant. Truly funny comedy & sharp social commentary.It touched on so many important themes surrounding gender, our patriarchal society and capitalism.It is definitely a feminist movie for women who grew up playing with the dolls.One of the best things I've seen in a long while.The set design and costumes were totally brilliant.Go see it! I'm already planning to go again with my sister!"
"I thought the first half of the movie was quite humorous, taking the Mickey out of the whole Barbie phenomenon that it is.Great colour and cinematography and I even laughed in some parts. Then something strange happened about half way through: it got all serious and made Ken a baddie and then decided to preach to us about the injustices that women have endured (which I agree to be true, but didn't fit where I thought this movie was going).Not quite sure who this movie was intended for, but I walked out disappointed. The males all ended up being either bad or stupid, or both. Not sure if this is a film that the great Will Ferrell can hold his head up high for as his role served very little purpose.The acting and cinematography saved it."
"One might think this is a girly movie made for teenage girls and may be the early 20s. It starts off misleading the audience into a fun filled ride of jokes and conscious silliness at the start. Later, as we all settle into the Barbie world, it slides in Feministic conversations. At one point you think whether it's an adaptation of ""Men are from Mars..."" book, because they hit you deeper than the laugh you make of the dialogue.The subtext I gather is, the film is about a rich good looking girl who is living her hunky dory life where everything is spik and span. This girl has been metaphored as the Barbie. The girl who understands little of the real world until life hits her with ugly truth (revealed at the end) and she starts feeling real pain and emotions. At first she denies it and fights it and also gets it all back for a brief moment. Later she realizes, she wants to live real and wants to let go of the made up cocoon of beauty, perfection and pink.Entertaining, fresh and perfect Sunday morning watch to setup for an interesting discussion later in the evening."
"This film has hilarious moments and it visually looks good with the set, costume, and prop designs. HOWEVER, the film shoves its agendas down our throats like it's thanksgiving dinner.The marketing team played it off as just a fun, harmless, self-aware comedy but the end result is this cake full of feminism, mockery of the entire male species, outright preachy at times and covered in icing of a colorful fun experience.The movie contrasts Barbieland as female-dominated/controlling with men to the sidelines who just are just there to wave at barbie or something. Likewise, in the real world, men control everything and women are just there to look pretty and clean and stuff. The film shows half the human population (the men) as utterly and irredeemably horrible.And by the end you would assume they would compromise and have equal power and respect and everyone would see the value of men and women being both pretty awesome and that they should work together as a team? Nope! The Kens just wither back to the sidelines to their depressing selves while the Barbies go back to their girl-power or ruling everything without thinking twice about it. It feels like they almost had a good ending, but simply just couldn't help themselves.In front of where me and my friends were sitting was this mom and her two daughters who seemed around 5 and 7 and that poor little girl was squirming in her seat and asking ""Is it almost over?"" multiple times to her mom who was trying to quiet her down during another preachy scene. Do not take your little girls to this one. Truly a wolf in sheep's clothing. Using a kid's toy as a trojan horse for feminist messaging is just ridiculous."
"Even though she is only a doll, she does not have to be an airhead. Here in lies ""Lady Bird"" filmmaker Greta Gerwig's creative, modern-day approach to bringing one of America's most recognizable toys to life on screen. When you add that to the decision to cast Margot Robbie in the lead role, ""Barbie"" is off to the right, flawlessly arched start.Barbie's aspirational charm contributes to her brand's strength. Barbie has been criticized for imposing unattainable beauty standards, but she also served as a reminder to girls that everything is possible because different models have depicted her as the president, a rocket scientist, and even transgender. Do you know who else has inflated ideals of beauty? Celebrities in movies. They act as role models, much like Barbie, which is why Gerwig's interpretation of the wildly successful toy brand is so creative.While making Ryan Gosling's dumb Ken the brunt of most of its gender-equity humor, this film hits all the appropriate criteria. The result is a very funny children's film with the phrases of a first-year liberal arts student, which tosses around terms like ""patriarchy"" and ""appropriation"" - pretty much everything but ""problematic,"" which the film means without actually referring to Barbie's legacy.The script by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach feels most audacious on this front. The hit movie ""Barbie"" openly accuses the best-selling doll of undermining the women's movement in addition to making light of Mattel.With a subject like this, the power of nostalgia shouldn't be understated, since much of Gerwig's approach affects mature women and homosexual audiences who have owned the dolls - and for whom she has concealed references and deep-cut facts throughout. Even though Gerwig occasionally uses the film as the vehicle for what seems like a gender studies lecture for undergraduates, it is evident that the movie was created by professionals who understand how children's imaginations develop while playing with Barbies."
Barbie is basically exactly what we need right now. A hilarious summer blockbuster with a social commentary nuanced enough to allow young ones to enjoy but present enough for you to get something out of it. Margot Robbie is brilliant and a perfect Barbie. Gosling shows off his incredible comedic talent more than ever.Most all the jokes land well. It's clear that the actors understood Gerwig's vision and Gerwig and Baumbach's script. Set and costume design are on another level in Barbie. The distinction between Barbieland and the real world is done very well thanks to set design.See Barbie!
"Saw this kind of late on 07/21 after Oppenheimer. As expected the movie looks great, Barbieland is a crazy set, shot well and all actors are committed.Was a bit disappointed with Gosling but could just be the writing/direction for him. Margot Robbie and America Ferrara shine the most, and to a lesser extent Gosling, Kate McKinnon and Will Ferrell (those last two are smaller side characters).Some issues with pacing or maybe the movie should've shorter, and the music wasn't all that memorable surprisingly. I would've like more songs or better yet for this whole movie to be a musical!My biggest gripe is the writing. It is painfully heavy handed, preachy and full of cringe. This is because the evil patriarchy and righteous feminism is ramped up to 100.I honestly kept checking my watch, was looking at uber's home with like 30-40min left, and struggling so hard not to walk out (i never do, always stay to the end no matter what!) or fall asleep. Maybe it was partly because I had just gotten out of the 3hr Oppenheimer (which I had a strong coffee during) but this was one of the toughest movies I had to sit through in a theater in a very long time.I think most, but still probably not all, women will enjoy it, but for the fellas? Unless you're a self described male feminist or far-left politically, or maybe just a simp, your mileage is really going to vary and this may not be for you.I like Greta Gerwig and the cast but this was a big miss and let down for me. Messaging aside, I struggle to give this higher than a 5, maybe a 6 at the absolute best, wouldn't give it lower than a 3. So I'm going with 4/10."
"Well, if a film like The Lego Movie can come out and be clever and great, I guess a Barbie film can as well. I will always hesitate when a product receives a film based on it because it just seems shameful in terms of marketing. Audiences will always receive a few diamonds in the rough though, and Barbie is just that. It's definitely the most fun I've had at the movies this year. It's a lot more than just bright colours so let's get into it.To keep it simple, the film follows Barbie (Margot Robbie) as she realizes there is more to life than just living in Barbieland. Accompanied by Ken (Ryan Gosling), they venture to the real world. With many revelations about how awful our world is, the two of them discover what is both good and bad about life. I'm keeping it vague because what helps this simple story become a more complex one is the social commentary and incredibly funny humour. I was laughing hysterically throughout and I was genuinely moved by the end.Certain viewers may find some of the messages to be heavy-handed, but I didn't. In fact, I found that the messages actually made the film better overall. Yes, it's a film that explores equal rights, but it does so in a fashion that doesn't downgrade anyone, but rather puts others on a higher pedestal. I really liked how the film handled all of the issues it presented. I shouldn't have been too surprised though, because Greta Gerwig as a director is just fabulous.Having liked both Lady Bird and Little Women, Gerwig has continued to impress me as a director, even if I haven't exactly loved any of her films yet. Well, I believe her efforts here made the best film of her career to date. There are so many different variations of Ken and Barbie and the performances she pulls out of each and every one of these performers was nothing short of great. I mean, with that said, it didn't hurt that the cast was perfection.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are terrific as always and are obviously the main reason to see this film on the surface, but America Ferrera and Simu Liu were also standouts to me. Each character either had a dramatic or comedic moment that stood out and I couldn't get enough of the whole cast. Michael Cera as Allen is gold as well, but in the end, this is a film that all came down to the screenplay. Yes, the set design is award-worthy, the musical number is worthy of an Oscar-nomination, but Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach crafted a genius script here. The nuances throughout are what sent this film over the edge for me. Their attention to detail was perfect here. I highly recommend Barbie to all ages and genders."
"Barbie is an anomaly, a force of nature, and could potentially be some sort of trendsetter in ways I can't quite fathom yet. I never expected a good Barbie movie to exist, especially not one that is so poignant and rich with satire, ambition, and intellect. But, this movie isn't just good - it's fantastic.Choosing to make ""facade"" one of the primary focuses of the film was probably the most brilliant thing that writer/director Greta Gerwig could have done, because it allows the movie to function as a wholly progressive and often quite meta experience. Though the movie only goes back and forth between Barbie Land and ""reality"", I felt as if I traversed through 5 or 6 different dimensions throughout the course of the film. The movie has so many layers, I'm not even sure how Gerwig made it work - maybe it was luck, maybe it was an incredibly talented cast & crew, or maybe she's just a genius.What's most important is that the movie is hilarious, all the way through. There weren't many segments where a giant smile was not plastered across my face. Though the choices for comedic roles could be perceived as cliche, all of them murdered the game with their characters, that being Michael Cera as Allan, Kate McKinnon as Weird Barbie, and of course Will Ferrell as the CEO of Mattel. But, it's Ryan Gosling that truly steals the show as the funniest part of the entire film. Of course, it's the brilliant writing that allows it, but Gosling's commitment to bringing to life one of the greatest exaggerations of masculinity I have ever seen put to screen is diamond-level. The way the movie spotlights parallels between straight-guy masculinity and gayness, as both a joke and an astute observation, is incredible and done in a way I've never seen pulled off before.It should be said that what allows a comedy to transcend the bone-headed standards that the genre usually plants itself in, is a script that actually has something to say, from the heart and from the brain. I figured it would poke fun at certain gender tropes and politics, but I didn't expect Barbie to be full of so much existential philosophy. At times it almost felt like Charlie Kaufman LITE, but in a GOOD WAY. Though most of the film is full of laughs, it also has several segments that will suddenly take you to realms of sheer reflection and a surprising amount of emotional resonance. I think a lot of people had to get over an ""am I about to cry at a Barbie movie?"" hump, but...I want you to know that you should cry at this movie! It's both nostalgic and totally ahead of its time at the same time. It's actually a very serious and important film underneath all the pink & the laughs.And on that note, it's not surprising that so many dudes are already calling it a horrible movie and overly woke feminist propaganda, but it's definitely lame of them, and in my opinion, wrong. I think a lot of these people are missing a lot of the points and the jokes. Though on the surface the movie seems to be poking most fun at men, it pokes just as much fun at femininity, society, and the human experience as a whole. It has a lot of critical things to say about all of them. Plus, if you can't laugh at your own kind, especially when it's done so articulately, with so much love, I really think you're doing it all wrong.It comes as no surprise that Margot Robbie carries the film wonderfully. The soundtrack is also a ton of fun. But the most exciting part here, ""as a fan of the cinema"", is knowing that this is going to take Greta Gerwig to the absolute top of the totem pole. She's been such an interesting, tasteful, and likable multi-faceted presence, between acting, writing, and directing, and I'm very curious and excited to see what she does with her power after this."
"I liked how the movie was fun and colorful and had a basic story, if you want to chill and have fun this is the right movie, I watched it after Oppenheimer.Barbie was a movie for all people you can watch it with your friends or family.I got my tickets because of ""Ryan Gosling"" I think he carried the movie and made it better and funnier if it was someone else. I'll never buy a ticket for Barbie.So take my advice and go get your tickets and have fun.. so that's my basic review for a movie I hope you liked it and if you disagree with me put dislike let me know if you like my opinion..
, :)"
"It was beautiful and brilliant, didn't expect it's gonna be too good. Greta tells the -ve side of the real world beautifully wrapped in humor and childhood nostalgia for many.Margot is the STAR, she's unreal man, whatever role she does it seems she's born for that.Ryan was brilliant and so was Will Ferrel, both did an outstanding job. The take on patriarchy is nicely done, Greta is a brilliant director.Just speechless to see how Margot Robbie every single time nail the character she plays, she's just outstanding whether it's Harley or Barbie, she's born to play these roles.Go and experience the Barbie world."
"The movie is okay if you wanna have a laugh and entertainment.The script is a bit weird but it has it point.Goslint and Margot are so good in their characters.The first 45 are a bit intensive and laughable. But ""the second half"" are enjoyable with a fun and more realistic view.Barbie shows and tells the hard lite of a woken in the real world but also the hard world of Ken in the barbie world.The moviemaker takes up the life of barbies that our childhood was obsessed with. Clothes,cars,houses and characters in a perfect way.The movie has a cirkus plot and a bit raily but in the end it is OK."
"The movie in my opinion is great, it's no Godfather but it's a movie about BARBIE it's supposed to be fun, easy going and delightful but also amazingly brings up the problems of todays women and MEN. It has a great portrayal of the difference between the barbie world and the real human world. The characters are weirdly relatable and understandable. Margot Robbie was the best pick for barbie and Ryan as Ken ( even tho some may disagree, but no just watch the movie he is perfect) it's really funny but also in some scenes very sad and relatable. I recommend watching this movie because of :
1. Humour the ending really caught me off guard ngl 😂
2. The movie not being dragged out and hard to watch
3. Interesting storyline even tho there are still those smarts that think it's basic. It's not. It made me realise some sadder things about characters like Ken and think about the human world
4. Message you gotta watch the movie for this one 😏
5. Great acting, dancing and yesss even singing its a bit basic and cheesy to put this to the list but I find it really impressive on how natural a human can act like a barbie.6. Great props makes you feel like they're actually in a plastic house."
"Let's just get it out of the way, I freaking love Barbie. So many memories and ideals are connected to her that even without the movie I still get nostalgic about. The iconography, the looks, Ken (~swoon~)... there was one problem though, I am a boy, I could never get a Barbie because my parents never would let me have one. Instead I stole my cousins mermaid Barbie and treated her like one of my most precious toys until she disappeared, perhaps she went into Barbieland? Greta Gerwig's movie seemingly let us tap into all of that and more thanks to a great PR team that I haven't seen work their magic since a long long time, in other words hype has been BUILT. How does it fare? I left the cinema with a smile but I wish that it could have something MORE. Let me explain down below.Barbie is a movie that is about Barbie, the doll, the idea, living in a world separate from reality called Barbieland a world where Barbie is everything, from the president to a Nobel prize laureate to a doctor. She runs this world in all her iterations, until the stereotypical Barbie somehow gets thoughts about death, she gets a flat foot (CHAOS!) and she gets cellulites (THE HORROR!)- she has to fix this by travelling in the real world with Ken and in this she meets a hard working mother and her cynical daughter- fun hijinks galore!This movie has got the aesthetics DOWN, like it's so pretty and so meticulously done with all the details, to how the actors act and how the worlds are built- this is more on how the Barbie world is, because when it mixes with the real world. That's where things get a bit complicated.Example; There's no actual ""real"" separation between Barbieland or the real world, meaning that the real world feels like a mirror flipped version of Barbieland where people act just as outlandish as the titular dolls. I kinda wish that Greta would've made a script that actually puts Barbie in real world, how it is right now, and I know that Greta is great at making reality feel relatable and recognisable and human but I felt there was not much of a difference. Maybe it was so that they could fill the whole Mattel-company storyline in it? Either way I wish that Greta would play more with these contrasts and fish-out-of-water-feelings.This in turn makes the other characters that should be relatable for the moviegoers- i.e. The daughter and the mother feel painfully flat and just unnecessary for the story overall, despite making them ""deep"" they felt honestly super flat, like dolls and stereotypes of characters in a movie. And I don't think that was Greta's intention, not if you see the movies that she's done before where there's always a singular perspective but here I think she's kind of confused on who to use the perspective the most on. Luckily it is Barbie and Ken for the most of the movie, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are doing a fantastic job at playing these characters and it's in their moments where the comedy shines the most.Another missed opportunity generally I think is just addressing the gay history that is tied to the Barbie brand. And how gay men like me were influenced by it- not to say that this was absolutely important for a movie like this but I still feel like it would've made sense, at least the gay doll of 90s Ken (who was made popular in the 90s due to being bought by mostly gay men) made an appearance, if only briefly. I know, I shouldn't make demands about this but I feel like there would've been something even more interesting with addressing all the boys that play with Barbie dolls, the ""real world"" feels very black and white in this sense. But I regress, this is just a tangent and a thought!I love the comedic and camp elements, I think they are what sustain the movie and the fashion of course. Also I love that it brings forth the themes of feminism as that is needed in a movie like this, I think that it does so in a great manner. Is it the movie that I wanted? Not really, but I'm glad that it exists, I'm glad that I saw it. Maybe I was too much swayed by the whole PR marketing strategy but I really wanted this to be a new camp and fun fun classic. Instead it feels just good and that's ok. I wanted it to be more of an adult-oriented movie and maybe that's where Greta kind of flubbed it, trying to make it both kid and adult friendly but she honestly doesn't succeed at neither and that's alright."
"Seeing a lot of reviews saying that this movie is preachy, the men are portrayed as idiots, etc. It's a SATIRE. It is meant to be over the top. And yes, it has a lot to say. But the fact that some people in the audience (and I'd wager some of the negative reviews are from people who didn't bother to watch the movie) don't want to hear it, doesn't make it any less valid.In Barbieland, Ken is just an accessory to Barbie and is portrayed as nothing more than an object - something women in the real world deal with all the time. The fact that so many men are reacting so negatively to this movie tells me they don't like being treated the way that women are treated every day. And that is the point of the movie - yet it has much more to say than that. Ultimately, the message in Barbie isn't that ""women rule and men drool"" - it's that patriarchy ultimately harms both men and women. And that's true. So people who say this movie is anti-men are missing the entire point. Patriarchy may give men privilege but it ultimately hurts them, too - pressuring them to conform to a rigid idea of manhood and silencing their self-expression.I am living for the fact that this movie is unapologetic about showing the absurdity of it all. I would have given it a 10 if it weren't for the cringe worthy Ken dance number. It was the only weak part of the movie. But otherwise, Bravo!"
"Barbie sets herself to go to the real world to solve her flat feet and cellulite by connecting with the girl that played with her.Entering Barbieland is breathtaking. It's built exactly like a child's imagination with incredible set designs and quirky mechanics. The first thirty minutes are fun and filled with music and bright colours. The dance sequences brings me back to my childhood where I would create these kinds of scenes with my toys. I wish we could have stayed in this wonderland a bit longer before we had to get to the real world.Ryan Gossling stole the show. I don't remember the last time I laughed so much. It was iconic how Gerwig reversed the narrative and made Ken into the typical representation of women in film. The film is so clever and is clearly made by someone that is a student of film. With references of Space Odessey, the Matrix, The Truman Show, The Wizard of Oz, and hundreds of others, it made the film have that much more depth.I feel like the plot could have been rearranged a bit. The quests Barbie is supposed to solve seems irrelevant to me. It offers comic relief, but I believe it would have been more pertinent to have her explore the real world to see how Barbies ""saved"" us. The mom and daughter character are useless to the narrative. Other than having 0 personality or depth, we never got to understand their tension or learn their drives. They could have been better written, or removed all together. The monologue sequence was a mistake. Show me how women live in this world instead of telling me. It sounded too preachy for me, despite me being a feminist. If we would have spent less time on the mother and daughter, and more on giving concrete examples of women's pressure, it would have been a stronger film.The story and characterization is also lacking at Mattel. We never get a conclusion to why Mattel went back to Barbieland. The story felt incomplete, and perhaps overly cut due to corporate producers. This brings me to argue that we didn't receive the movie that was intended by the director. Although it being a critique on our society and the impossible standards for women, it could have been pushed even further. Perhaps the large presence of corporate players like Mattel and Chevrolet hindered the extent of the satire. I was expecting a Kubrick kind of satire, and as much as we did get some of that, more subtle satire could have been beneficial. I have full confidence in Gerwig's skills which is why I'd be curious to see a directors cut. Let's petition for it!The ending was also disappointing for me. I felt like I was watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 for no apparent reason. Perhaps they didn't really know where to go with the story and I'm shocked they chose that. I liked that we got to meet the creator of Barbie, but there was something missing for me. Overall, this was a fun time. I think most audiences will enjoy this despite having some plot holes. I look forward to watching it again in the future."
"Despite the strong commercial tone, it is still possible to perceive that we are watching a film by Greta Gerwig. And the undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. ""Barbie"" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the ""corporate"" issue. It won't be strange if you catch yourself thinking ""how did Mattel let this film see the light of day?"" Laughing at yourself, after all, seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itself.In the debate proposal for important social disparities in the face of the artificial tackiness of the Barbie Universe, the direction manages to create precious dialogues and situations, very well dosed with humor and other variations of the dramatic genre that permeate the acts of the project. In these changes of atmosphere, we were able to appreciate the creative photography by Rodrigo Prieto - who shoots 50 shades of pink in the same scene without making us want to vomit - and the dozens of visual references that influenced the director in the aesthetic configuration, between composition of scenes and very particular plastic choices, such as costume pieces, type of hair or cinephile jokes that we had already had contact with since the trailer parodying 2001: A Space Odyssey. Here, we'll catch glimpses of ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""The Truman Show""; we'll go through the fairytale-like artificiality of Jacques Demy's films; for the dance and choreographic performance of Gene Kelly; for the visual and dramatic intensity of The Little Red Shoes and All That Jazz... it's a lot. ""Barbie"" is a well of enriching cinematographic references.But, leaving aside that the film is indeed fun and has a creative and stunning look, in addition to addressing important points of today's society, Greta Gerwig ends up exaggerating her hand and transforms ""Barbie"" into a blatant and extremely exaggerated feminist activism. The production is very much in line with a famous Quentin Tarantino interview in 2021 given to Bill Maher on his HBO broadcast ""Real Time"" in which he said: ""Ultimately, ideology trumps art, individual effort, good, entertainment"". Unfortunately, in this film, this doll that belonged to the imagination of several generations of women was dragged into the cultural war, used as a puppet by political militancy, full of language, allegories, open messages and ideological discourses. The film misses an opportunity to be a film for everyone, to be a comedy and romance epic, and it had the quality to do so, but it preferred to focus on the most brazen militancy that cinema has ever produced, trying to please a specific audience and clearly attack certain targets of this ideological patrol.The film has an interesting premise, that's undeniable, and it flows most of the time, but the audience is bombarded with pervasive indoctrination especially in the art scene at every turn. Since the target audience here is females of all ages, this audience may even enter the cinema wanting to be entertained, but will graduate in all subjects addressed among feminists: an ode to the intrinsic evil of patriarchy; criticism of beauty standards; the hypocritical discourse against consumerism (as if Warner, Mattel, artists were not going to profit millions from movie ticket sales, from selling new dolls, etc.); man-hatred (all men portrayed in the film are portrayed as idiots, greedy, dumb, or wanting power for themselves). Greta Gerwig's goal as a screenwriter is super smart in this regard, because the ""Stereotyped"" Barbie comes to the real world completely innocent and she is being indoctrinated following the feminist primer that shows how she has to think and act, mainly in the perception of men and progressive militancy - the character Sasha, played by Ariana Greenblatt, is the one who plays this role, like the militant of today, always connected and who knows everything about life (where Gerwig puts her speech in the mouth of the character so that she speaks her true s intentions).The truth is that the film essentially revolves around hate, not love. Barbie, here, hates men, capitalism, fun and hates Barbie doll herself (calling her a fascist and worse throughout the plot). Barbie also hates women who have cute memories of the doll, if you're a woman and you played with her as a kid, according to the movie, you supported patriarchy. Barbie can't just be a pretty, blonde, thin woman either, after all, that doesn't encompass the mandatory ""diversity and inclusion"" in Hollywood today. To resolve this issue, they created a universe in which everyone is Barbie (we even have a Barbie who was born a man, yes, a trans Barbie - who, by the way, is a doctor). The men in Barbieland (who cares) are there to be mistreated and ignored. Ken is just an accessory. When Barbie and Ken come into the real world, everything changes. Ken discovers patriarchy (a word spoken a dozen times throughout the plot) and likes that world. Barbie finds unbridled machismo (if Barbie were set in the 60s it would even make a little sense). Romance between Barbie and Ken? Not at all, after all that wouldn't be ""empowering"" at all. Ken even rejects the doll at one point.Ken represents the ""evil patriarchy"". Everything in this film becomes one big lecture, one big sermon (Barbie scolding workers who whistle at her; police officers harassing Barbie at the police station; a man slapping her on the butt out of the blue), that is, victim of the ""toxic"" men of the world. Barbie still has to choose between flip-flops and heels, showing that in the end there is only one choice to be made: follow feminism, that is, flip-flops. We also have the passage of the protagonist Gloria cheating on her husband (a fool, by the way), and the film shows that the betrayal was legal and she had an advantage in cheating.All male clichés are portrayed here according to the feminist view (because apparently men have had no problems in life since the beginning of time, according to the film's script). Here, the Barbies were co-opted by the brainwashing of patriarchy and used by the Kens in a kind of macho dystopia. Everything Ken likes is depicted as toxic, evil, and terrible (Stallone, Godfather, horses, Zack Snyder, etc.). Barbieland is portrayed as a perfect world for women (women have everything, men have nothing); Mattel executives are all portrayed as white, straight men and still calls this type of profile ""conservative fascist"". For the director, it is never enough to be a woman, you have to be a mother, a wife, work and still receive criticism. The unsuspecting will also believe that even today women do not have leadership positions in large companies, and that they cannot study, work and that they receive lower wages than men doing the same type of work (Yes, because apparently the ""evil businessmen"" hire men to pay higher wages when they could pay less for a woman to do the same job!!). At the end of the plot, Gloria's feminist discourse is the antidote to the brainwashing of oppressive patriarchy. Kens are beaten because they are ""dumb"". The Barbies' plan was to pretend to be submissive and then make their respective Ken jealous with another Ken, of course, after all, all men only know how to create wars, destroy everything they lay their hands on and are automatically stupid (After all, if men are stupid, why do they dominate the world according to what was propagated in the film? A basic and inexplicable plot hole here).""Barbie"" is a great satire, but when it touches on feminist issues, it gets serious and uses irony to make fun of men, since women are portrayed as being totally perfect. Sasha and Gloria are the main Latin characters here and the Barbie character is just the shell for the director to propagate her feminist ideas. Obviously, the film will have an excellent box office due to all the hype and marketing made for the film and, of course, the popularity of the Barbie doll that has been successful for generations, in addition to having many merits, especially in the technical part. The detailed, creative and extremely tasteful scenarios, especially in Barbieland, are a spectacle in themselves, in addition to the magnificent performances by Margot Robbie (charismatic and incredibly beautiful) and Ryan Gosling (hilarious as ever). The musicals, on the other hand, are horrible, poorly performed and owing a lot in that regard.""Barbie"" talks about choices and changes. In the hands of Greta Gerwig, the typical behavior of dolls and dolls, via imagination, takes on a critical form and points to many paths, visiting metalanguage, political-social relations, patriarchy and feminism, feelings (including the arrogant and insensitive posture of Barbie in front of Ken; as well as the unhealthy dependence of the doll on his girlfriend), existential crises or acceptance of one's social and gender condition. The work fulfilled the promise that we would have a product different from what could be imagined from a live-action Barbie, that is undeniable. The problem is that, in the end, ""Barbie"" doesn't even get a satisfactory answer to the simplest question of her journey of self-discovery. ""Who is Barbie?"": the only possible conclusion is that it is a toy that has ensured at least two more decades of popularity."
"After years and years of development and casting changes, the live action Barbie movie is finally out for the whole world to see. Co-written and directed by actor turned filmmaker Greta Gerwig and co-produced by and starring Margot Robbie as the titular doll, the film has proven to be one of the most anticipated summer blockbusters of 2023 and a welcome anniversary present to Warner Bros' 100th year since their inception. Now that the film is out for the public and media to enjoy, the best way to describe it is a hysterically subversive commentary on feminism disguised as a cheesy fantasy comedy.The film follows Stereotypical Barbie and Ken going on a journey of self-discovery following an existential crisis, all the while encountering people who either want to make or break the doll's spirits. Before going into the story itself, the ensemble cast must be addressed, especially Robbie and Ryan Gosling as the primary Barbie and Ken respectively. In addition to sharing witty chemistry with each other, the multiple Barbies and Kens around Barbieland showcase the blessings of multiple roles for women to take on and a curse in how that can influence the men around them to call the shots. Alongside them is America Ferrera as Mattel employee Gloria who has as much to do with Barbie's existential crisis as she does in trying to repair her distant daughter Sasha stuck in her grumpy teen phase, showcasing how different generations operate around the famous Barbie line of toy making. Alongside many other well known names like Will Ferrell and Rhea Perlman as two differentiating role models for women around the world, the ensemble cast is exactly what will draw butts into seats.Now as far as the film itself is concerned, the biggest contributing factor to how outlandish it is is that its worldbuilding makes no sense at all. Barbieland is supposed to be the place where all the Barbies and Kens live their lives to the fullest, yet the real world is interlinked based on how people have played with them. That being said, since the film is meant to highlight the conflicting views of feminism in a still patriarchal society, the imaginative execution of how the dolls and people interact makes for a lot of eye opening politics centered around how complicated the world truly is. While it's difficult to say if the film hit all of its targets, especially when the politics it tackles are still relevant today, its humor and commentary lies in the blending of childhood nostalgia and adult intellectualism. This is what partially leads to Barbie's wanting to leave her ""perfect"" paradise and Ken's attempts to see Barbie for who he pretends to be. Who could have thought a Barbie movie would have reminded us how difficult it is to face having to hide who we truly are out of pressure?Of course, the production and costume design are what truly stand out around this ambitious feature. In contrast to the mundane real world, Barbieland is composed of bright colors and make-believe dream houses, complete with a wide variety of diverse costumes and elaborate sets making up the surreal fantasy landscape. As the Barbies function through pretend toy logic, there are some amusing visual gags based on their imaginary lifestyles and how they appear based on what their owners and Mattel did to them in the long run. The addition of much cartoony stunt work makes the film even more hilarious when you realize how little logic is actually in the film depending on the universe. Next to Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt lending their talents to an accompanying score and amusing musical numbers, one can sense a true glance of nostalgia with many well known hit songs that contribute to the film's tone and commercial exploitation. It's hard to say if the film is a jukebox musical or not, but it certainly is a riot with how much the audience will jive to the beat of the tunes.In a day and age where we seem to be forgetting how much fun movies can truly be, Greta Gerwig's Barbie is a wonderful reminder as to why it's ok to embrace your inner child in a world overrun with societal beatdowns and forced maturity. Whether or not you've ever been into the Barbie toy line, this film is an absolute must watch for both the casual filmgoer and fans of hysterical fantasy comedies. It is self aware enough to make us laugh at even the smallest of jokes, it is mature enough to embrace its own immaturity, and it is a reason to still support the hard working crew with how the film industry is going nowadays."
People who followed all the lawsuits and all the Barbies throughout the years. It broke every single Hollywood Law in the books. Mattel made Satire out of their own overprotection of the Barbie Product. Margot Robbie was a breath of fresh air when she produced and starred in Barbie. This is one movie for both males and females and those who absolutely HATE Barbie. It is pure comedy and will never stop laughing throughout the whole movie.Know your Barbie History before coming to the movie. Know the lawsuits which Mattel brought to those who used Barbie as Satire. 64 years of history in.one hour and fifty-four minutes.
"Barbie is a story of a Barbie gaining sentience when her owner hits a bad time affecting her life in BarbieLand. She develops human feelings and tries to come to term with it by meeting her humans whilst forced to string along her Ken. Ken sees the real world, he to finds more things that can be of his benefit, WHILE Barbie falls into much deeper bad time. Ruckus happens as the Mattel Company AND Barbie tries to make thing back to what it is used to be.A very well conceptualized film about Barbie and her plight of finding the meaning of life. I think this is a great idea BUT clearly there are things that can be better.Loved mostly its darker and dramatic moments. Gerwig wrestling the ideas of Barbie both in the Feminist context and the how the public sees it at large was a masterclass. It is where the story really held its landing. YOU could see how Barbie both as an idea and a product, comes to term of how she affected the culture or just how the culture at large move ahead. The scene with Ruth and Barbie is so well placed in the script.But for the mixed parts of the film, I felt more mixed with the comedic aspect of the film. The script was fun but verbally the schtick can be quite repetitive. It also was not that witty at times AND pass quirkiness as such. It was not. Visually, its funnier though but a lot of the jokes can be a hit or miss. I do not think Gerwig understood HOW TO END it with the Ken's BUT practically its her nodding the first wave Feminist, by them maybe trying to get the fundamental rights first before going all out but without any repurcussion for the Ken Movement.I also did not like how anti-climactic the Un-Kendollification of the Barbie's was. The grand standing gesture was just repeated too much, that it kinda loses a lot of its power but I guess it was to make sense of the plans for the Ken's afterward.Acting wise definitely, I think Gosling did the best with the comedic material, with Robbie excelling in more dramatic portion of the film. Not as impressed with the others except maybe for McKinnon's weird Barbie and Issa Rae as President Barbie, which both has moments but too small to really be noteworthy.I think it is definitely overhyped AND was meant for children BUT Gerwig did great with all the hoopla she had faced to make this film, especially with its themes of Female Identity AND Barbie herself, the portion of the film I think it had its best success. Robbie deserves the accolades as she brings to life Barbie. Gosling was also good as the very much confused Ken. 3.5/5."
"First, I'd like to clarify one thing: Barbie is not an ""Anti-Men"" or a ""Men-Hating"" Movie in any shape or form. Instead, it is a very thought-provoking exploration of contemporary ideas such as Identity, Self-discovery, Existentialism, Ethics, Feminism, Gender Roles, Consumerism, Materialism, Beauty and Body Image.Barbie feels like a satirical take on the real world, the world we live in.The opening scene of Barbie was very similar to the opening scene of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Then we get introduced to the Barbieland, the most perfect, ideal world according to the Barbies. Everyone's happy, everyone's joyful, and cheerful, and most importantly everything is being run by the Barbies. EVERYTHING. Ken is just a supporting character. There won't be a Ken with Barbie.But then things start to change, Barbie talks about DEATH. Mind you, nobody dies in Barbieland, they get discontinued by MATTEL. Then Barbie embarks on a journey of self-discovery accompanied by Ken.One of my favorite scenes is when Barbie and Ken are in the real world and both of them get catcalled. The stark contrast between the reaction of both Barbie and Ken to the catcalling was portrayed very accurately.Ken learns about Patriarchy in the real world. Ken used to live in a world where everything is run by Barbie but in the real, it's literally the opposite. Ken takes all he has learned in the real world back to Barbieland and changes everything. He literally changes Barbieland to ""Kendom Land"".Meanwhile, Barbie is trying to find answers to why she doesn't feel perfect anymore or why she doesn't feel pretty anymore.We get a glimpse of the Mattel Corporation as well and how literally every working person is like a doll.There is this one monologue in the film which stands out. The monologue which helped Barbie get out of her Existential Crisis.The last 15-20 minutes of the film are perfect, the set designing, the dialogues, everything - it was perfect.If you are someone who loves great films and enjoys great storytelling, you'll love Barbie.Give it a chance and you'll not regret it."
"Barbie.Barbie suffers a crisis that leads her to question her world and her existence.I've just watched Barbie and here me out, I was aware of what I'm going to receive, it was exactly what I thought!Barbie is a fun light movie that you can't take that serious in it's big picture , you just enjoy the colors, the dynamic and the concept in general...
The plot was kind of interesting, it makes you attached to the movie, the characters were silly but in a mostly funny way, it really had its funny moments especially with Ryan Gosling as Ken he was hilarious, I liked what he did here and Margot fits perfectly no need to say more about her.The only thing that made me uncomfortable is that they were trying to send messages through this film, it's not about the manner but the quantity, a dozen of them if I'm not afraid but it wasn't that forced to be fair.Enjoy it, the Kenergy was Kenough for me!"
"Greta Gerwig, you've done it again. There's a reason this movie has become such a phenomenon in modern culture and that's because it's always been a hit!The writing is absolutely genius with the right mix of attention-to-detail and suspension of disbelief for the imagination. The cast is so random but that makes it perfect, there's a Barbie or Ken for everyone no matter what. Their acting is superb too, everyone's line delivery left me cracking up each time.Go to the cinema and watch this film - I was fortunate enough to go to a screening where everyone shared my excitement and there were cheers in the crowd and applause at the end. It's an experience I will never forget. Thank you Greta Gerwig for my life."
"""Barbie"" is a film that left me with mixed feelings. While it had its strengths, like Ryan Gosling's exceptional performance and emotionally impactful scenes, I found the film to be a bit overloaded with messages. Some parts were polarizing, and the humor occasionally missed the mark.Spoiler alert: The film's message about embracing uncertainty and self-discovery was commendable, but the execution sometimes seemed confusing. The protagonist's journey towards self-acceptance could have led her to a simple job, symbolizing personal growth. Instead, the choice to visit a gynecologist seemed a little too on the nose.One standout aspect was the beautiful message conveyed through Billie's song, which added an exquisite touch to the film. Overall, I'd rate ""Barbie"" 7/10 stars for its strong performances and emotional moments, but it could have benefited from a more focused approach to its messages."
"Greta Gerwig hasn't missed yet with a film but this film is her first larger budget film. Similar to The Lego Movie, this film appears to be a harmless, funny commercial with a simple message but also like The Lego Movie, great writing and performances make it a heartfelt film with strong themes and messages.The plot is fairly straightforward with our main Barbie going on a journey of self-discovery in the real world, while Ken does the same. A simple premise but well executed. The plot deals with themes such as gender, equality, the loss of childhood and the nature of growing up with such good humour and heart. I had a smile on my face the entire time.The performances are strongest from the two leads, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. Both bring a lot of energy and life to Barbie and Ken, communicating the struggles of being both a man and woman and how one can't exist without the other. They have excellent chemistry and both inject their roles with great emotion. The rest of the cast are good though some felt unnecessary. Will Ferrell's CEO could have benefitted from more screen time or could've even been cut completely. Yet he is still hilarious in the scenes he is in.The set design is immaculate, Barbieland was a joy to witness. My only issue is we could've spent more time there. The score was great and the cinematography further helped with the immersion. Production-wise this film is gorgeous.The only problems are a few too many times of the film hammering it's message in to the point it can become annoying. There are also a few lines and jokes that don't land at all and seem entirely of the time. Yet, these are minor in the face that everything does right.Overall, Barbie is a lot of fun, with great comedy and a lot of heart. The leads are great, the set design is immaculate and the message is strong and positive. A fun film that I highly recommend."
"""Come on Barbie let's go party!""A comedy fun for audiences. Laugh, laugh, cry and laugh again. The first film I've watched that Greta Gerwig directed and I was impressed on how she was able to pull off a good film.Probably not the typical toy to live action movie set up but it really has the feels of Toy Story (crossover maybe? Kidding). What the film offers is a lot of comedy which movie viewers will likely to enjoy. It pays homage to the different types of Barbie dolls but that depressed and ordinary Barbie were the best in this film. With Barbie, there comes Ken and Alan? But Ken was not sidelined in this film. In fact, I kinda felt more empathy on Ken's side than on Barbie's. Yeah this is a film based on Barbie who of course we know that without Barbie, there won't be a Ken. However, this film shows its viewers that it shouldn't be that way. Ken is as important as Barbie. On the other hand, that speech of ""Gloria"" was really moving and very inspiring.This film takes us to a world where toys and humans interact. Where those who live in a cycle can break the chain and have a decision to make. Where every individual has a choice and every person in this world is as important as the other.Barbie is 7/10. Enjoyable, fun for family however as my friend have said, there were scenes in this film that felt like ""what's next?"" or some parts felt like fillers. Still, it was enjoyable and a good film.On the side note, Greta Gerwig, PLEASE DO WELL ON NARNIA ADAPTATIONS. In the meantime, where to buy that ""I am Kenough"" shirt?"
"Barbie is a new fantasy comedy directed, part written and produced by Greta Gerwig, director of Lady Bird and Little Women.In Barbieland, everything is perfect and everything runs smoothly. Yet Barbie (Margot Robbie) learns that something is not right and everything suddenly seems less than perfect for her. Because of this, she decides to travel to the real world, to find out what's going on.On this journey she is accompanied by Ken (Ryan Gosling), who secretly tried to go with her. Together they now try to figure out what's going on, but learn that the real world is very different compared to Barbieland.Greta Gerwig, together with the photography director Rodrigo Prieto, knows how to convey the Barbie world well, making it seem as if you are in a life-sized doll's room as a viewer. They used beautiful film sets for this. Thus, the film works well as long as it is set in the Barbieland. Only that everyone here is Barbie or Ken sometimes makes it a bit difficult to follow the exact differences between all Barbies and Kens.When the story moves to the real world, it changes the movie a bit. For example, how exactly it is possible to travel between the two worlds is not really clearly explained. Furthermore, the movie loses credibility when Barbie and Ken can do anything in the real world with no real consequences. Due to the lack of explanation and an eye for detail, the film can sometimes come across as a bit strange.In a comical way, they also try to make fun of both gender roles. For example, Barbieland should represent the opposite of the real world. In Barbieland, Barbies and Kens can do anything, but Barbie is often above Ken. In the real world, men often seem to be above women. For example, they try to divide this role in the opposite way. For male viewers, who do not like these current feminism movements, this can make this film less.Despite multiple actors and actresses playing different Barbies and Kens, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling manage to portray their roles in more unique ways alongside the other Barbies and Kens cast members. Margot Robbie comes across as a real Barbie, trying to discover what her life destinies really are. Ryan Gosling manages to provide plenty of appropriate comedic moments as Ken, who tries to make Barbie notice him. In the real world, however, he learns that as Ken, he can also do other things without Barbie. Will Ferrell plays the CEO of Mattel, the toy company that makes the barbie doll. His character and the other employees are supposed to be in the real world, but they seem more like they're also in a cartoon world because of the ways they act. This makes the concept of the real world seem a bit unusual. If they brought out the real world a little better, the movie could have been a little better.The Barbie and Ken concept is better brought to the fore in Toy Story 3, for example, where these dolls and the idea they stand for are also handled a bit playfully."
"Rating: 8.3
Overall, a feminist powerhouse of a movie as Greta Gerwig exceeded my expectations to create a very fun movie to watch as it is filled with an enjoyable cast, funny jokes, and memorable production design, costumes, and soundtrack as the movie tells many different messages about self-image and societal power, even though it is very on-the-nose about it and does not tie up all the loose ends.Good Direction (Although she does stick to her typical style of filmmaking, she uses a more palatable style of storytelling that incorporates meta humor that does not take itself too seriously to tell her messages; she builds both the Barbie World and the Real World very well; she gets a good amount from her actors (even though it is just so stupid at times what she has them do, an aspect that I kinda enjoyed, to be honest)), Pretty Good to Good Acting (Good to Very Good from Margot Robbie (Uses more of her experience as an actor and celebrity to play the role as she polls from many aspects of her career to create a multi-dimensional version of a once very shallow character), Very Good from Ryan Gosling (The real comedic relief of the movie as he steals the show in all his scenes with how silly and stupid he is; he is also a big driver of morality throughout the movie as he shows how the oppressed feel once they gain some ounce of power), Good from America Ferrera (Does well in her scenes and acts as the moral compass throughout the movie (bridging the divide between the Barbies and the Kens)), Pretty Good from Kate McKinnon (Plays the typical role she is used to playing), Pretty Good to Good from Michael Cera (The role of Allan was specifically written for him and he did his best embodying it), Pretty Good from Ariana Greenblatt (Plays her role well and acts as the youthful voice in the movie), Pretty Good from Simu Liu, Pretty Good from Issa Rae, Pretty Good from Rhea Perlman, Pretty Good to Good from Will Ferrell (Uses his experience as it is as if the role was written for him), Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Pretty Good Story (Pretty simplistic overall as it follows a pretty standard template but it pays homage to many different movies and is laid out well; the ending was pretty predictable though (and kinda feels like they didn't close up some of the messages they were trying to present)), Good Screenplay (Dialogue flows well (even though it is a bit on the nose/meta); jokes were surprisingly funny and helped make swallowing the message easier; the symbols and messages of the movie are taught throughout the movie and done so in a very easy way to understand given how overt they were (which is good cause there are surprisingly many nuances to them despite the subject matter/how it is told); foreshadowing was somewhat there but not as good as it could have been), Pretty Good Score/Very Good Soundtrack (More of a soundtrack than a score-based movie), Good to Very Good Cinematography (Really enjoyed the shots they used in Barbieland as it helps give it a cartoony yet cheap feel), Good Sound, Very Good Editing (Really enjoyed the assembly line shots in Barbieland as it helped give it a simulation feel), Good Visual Effects, Great Production Design (Really what makes the movie as the sets were great to look at with its cheap feel and how pink they were (giving a very big doll-house vibe)), Very Good to Great Costumes (Really help give the Barbie feel of the movie as they fit the doll vibe and help bring color and flavor to the movie), Plot Structure was pretty simplistic overall as it follows a pretty standard template (similar to that of a coming-of-age/trying to save your village type of movie), Pacing was good as it was not too fast or slow (no need to cut or add any content), Climax was decently executed as it shows some resolution in the conflict (but it does not do that great of a job tying up all the loose ends as it feels kinda forced), Tone was very cartoony/Barbie as it did a really good job at establishing this throughout the movie; there were also many different flavors of Greta Gerwig's style that were mixed throughout this movie."
"""Barbie"" is undoubtedly one of the most enjoyable films I've seen this year and yet it's also the most infuriating. Highly imaginative, (it's got the best pre-credit sequence in years), and laugh-out-loud funny it's got ideas to burn and therein lies the problem. Director and co-writer, (with partner Noah Baumbach), Greta Gerwig has set out to make the ultimate feminist tract dressed up in the brightest of pinks as a satire and while it works perfectly well as a satire full of self-conscious digs at its very creation, (we are constantly being reminded this is a movie called ""Barbie"" that we're watching), it's as a tract that it's in danger of sinking. That it doesn't is very much to Gerwig's credit; she's much too smart to really ruin her product and there is an awful lot here to enjoy.The thin plot has Barbie and Ken leaving Barbieland for the real world so Barbie can repair some sort of hole in the spectrum or some such nonsense that has allowed 'real' feelings (of a negative kind) to slip in and, naturally, since this is a film about dolls coming to life, it's decidedly silly and if had stayed silly it might have been inconsequential fun but Gerwig and Baumbach wants this to be 'consequential' fun, a laugh-a-minute message movie. Unfortunately one message doesn't appear to be enough; there were times I felt I was being battered to death by a giant message-wielding Barbie and by the time Will Ferrell's CEO of Mattel has left the real world for Barbieland the laughs had begun to dry up.Perhaps if someone had snipped about 20 minutes from the running time and dropped a few of the film's sermons this might have been the classic it was clearly aiming to be; that said, there are a lot of plusses here. It looks fantastic, the best gags are as good as anything Gerwig or Baumbach have given us in the past and best of all, it's got a couple of living dolls worthy of the name.Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, (there's even an in-joke about her in the movie), and, of course, she's wonderful and yet the film isn't hers. Barbie really belongs to Ryan Gosling who might become the first actor to be Oscar-nominated for playing a doll and given that the film is structured to make him a mouthpiece for its creators he brings an uncanny degree of feeling to the role and his performance is up there with his very best. As for Gerwig, maybe now that she's got her inner Barbie out of her system she might finally settle down to make comedies that are funny and meaningful and leave the sermons at home. We already know how good she can be."
"FIRST OFF LET ME SAY , I couldn't WAIT to see this. Got tickets for myself and friends. We all wore pink. The leads were terrific. The marketing campaign was completely misleading. The first 40 minutes at tops was what we all came to see . Then it became very heavy -handed. It became confusing. MATTEL who was one of the producers of it should feel shame for I think they ruined their good name with how they let themselves be represented. It was PG and right at the beginning when they have the little girls smashing I mean SMASHING their dolls to bits cause now their is Barbie...a couple of little kids in the audience got very upset to see the dolls smashed. THIS IS NOT A KIDS MOVIE. It wasen""t my kind of movie either. One of my friends said 'It was about an hour too long."" Their were these meanings and symbolism tht didnt need to be in this and whatever the writers were trying to get at ...it didn""t work at least for me.needlessly having Ken sing .......and thats the least of it....referring to the line ""Some of my best friends are jEWISH""...completly wrong....even though I now know the history of the doll ...just wasen""t necessary.... I cannot recommend ...I feel i wasted my friends time ....and some of mine...it really hurts your soul when you so look forward to seeing something and it turns out to be ...blech!"
I'm so happy with the casting that I can look past some other issues. It wasn't as nostalgic as I would have wanted it to be but this is definitely a new generations barbie movie. It really checked all the boxes with me. Fun costumes and great performances. It was fantasy and also very real. I can't think of anyone that could ever be better as Barbie than Margot Robbie. This was the perfects storm and it was a long time coming. Greta Gerwig's directing was fun and the script was inspiring. This movie won't be for everyone for sure but as a long time barbie fan I'm pleased. They left the movie in the perfect place and I don't need more. One and done and I'm ok with it.
"BarbieDazzling, heartfelt and brilliantly funny. Comedy of the year, movie of the summer!Barbie is a beautiful blend of comedy and heart. Aided deftly by colourful visuals, Greta Gerwig tells the story of a doll coming to life, with as much intellect and emotion that's needed.Barbie is unabashedly feminist, will ruffle some feathers (as it should), and will delight even more people. Themes of existentialism, individualism and masculinity are also dealt with.Despite being a product of Mattel, Greta found a way to critique the parent company (although it's funny that the product that mocks the maker ends up raking in more money for the maker).Margot Robbie is Barbie! She was an agreeable canvas, and she allowed Greta Gerwig to paint a very nuanced portrayal of Barbie. Ryan Gosling turns out a career-best performance in Barbie, stealing and shining in all of his scenes. The supporting cast also gives great performances.The soundtrack was fitting, guiding the movie down to the finish line with Billie Eilish's 'What was I made for' delivering a wonderful culmination. The set design and costumes were brilliant too.The lore of Barbie spans over six decades, so compressing it all into one movie was a definite challenge, but Greta was able to bring the most important things (including Easter eggs and fan service) to the movie.Barbie does have its failings, and the most noticeable is the plot. The first half is very intriguing, quirky and pays homage to other movies, but the second half isn't as tight.Barbie isn't perfect but it's a beautiful dose of everything good.8/10."
"On a comedic level, Barbie is perfect. Obviously aware of trending topics and internet memes, the movie never fails to burst waves of laughter every three to five minutes. Every element in this film will become a punchline at one point or another, including awkward dialogues, exaggerated movements, unexpected responses, the Sex Education trio, John Cena cameo, Helen Mirren's epic one-liner, and much more. One actor to be complimented is Ryan Gosling, who bestows a childly himbo character Ken with charismatic idiocy and amusing lightheartedness, in great contrast to his previous sigma characters like K from Blade Runner 2049.In terms of story, though, not much success can be claimed. With the movie's central conflict revolve around gender inequity, Barbie highlights the problem clearly, but provides an ambiguous answer. Although Gloria's monologue was unquestionably badass, both her and Sasha's character arcs are quite unconvincing. In general, the film gives either opaque or passive solutions to gender issues, which align with mainstream opinion, but are inherently fantastical especially with the plain storyline.In my opinion, Barbie's box office wonder largely results from its marketing, whether the grand casting, the luring mystique, or the bombastic pink. And yes, the movie is incredible for its aestheticism and creativity, but the story is overly fantastical and lacking gravity."
"Barbie, directed by Greta Gerwig, is a satirical and surreal comedy masterpiece that subverts and celebrates the iconic doll and her world. It's a small art house film on a big blockbuster scale. It's something we need more. It deserves acclaim for that risk that Mattel, WB, Gerwig and all its Cast and Crew took. Margot Robbie stars as Barbie, a plastic perfectionist who struggles to fit in with the rigid expectations of her society. When she is expelled from Barbieland for not being flawless enough, she embarks on a journey of self-discovery in the real world, where she meets a diverse and colorful cast of characters who challenge and inspire her. Along the way, she learns to embrace her flaws, find her voice, and unleash her inner sparkle.Gerwig's direction is brilliant, balancing humor and heart with a sharp eye for detail and a playful sense of style. The film is full of witty references, clever jokes, and hilarious situations that poke fun at the absurdity and contradictions of Barbie's culture, while also honoring its legacy and appeal. The cinematography, production design, and costumes are stunning, creating a vibrant and immersive visual experience that contrasts the artificiality of Barbieland with the realism of the human world.Robbie's and Gosling's performance is outstanding, capturing both the innocence and the sass of Barbie, as well as her growth and transformation. Gosling shines so bright in this. His song is chef's kiss! They are supported by a stellar ensemble. Barbie is a film that will make you laugh, cry, and think. It is a smart and subversive commentary on gender, beauty, identity, and consumerism, as well as a tribute to the power of imagination, creativity, and individuality. It is a film that proves that anyone can be anything they want to be, as long as they are true to themselves. It is a film that deserves a 10/10 rating. The Godfather of whatever this movie's genre is...."
"I definitely enjoyed watching it. It was light hearted and fun. However, I do find the asethetic a bit too bright for the eyes. Ironic. I know. Just personal preference. Music too loud at times too.I do like the message it gets across. It does make me think about the power imbalance of genders and possibly how all genders are oppressed under the patriarchy. It was pretty well done considering how many messages they need to delivers in such a short time. However, I do wish the story was a little bit deeper and that the twists and turns are a little less straight forward. Too much to ask? Maybe.But I like it and feel more empowered after watching."
I never cared for Barbie but the movie is really good I think the casting is perfect and the music and who they got to do the soundtrack I also love how they made the Barbie world a separate land and it was brighter then the whole world and I love how they went to the Mattel head quarters and the people trying to take her away and Barbie and Ken being in the real In the real world also the marketing team did amazing on the promo and advertisement on the movie with all the company's collab with Barbie and etc so overall the Barbie movie got a lot of hype and well deserved excellent film and amazing for people who love barbie.
"This is a weirdly complicated film. I wish I could say that was meant to be a compliment, but I found myself trying to figure out where all the pieces fit as the story unraveled.The basic premise seems simple enough and the jokes in the first 30 minutes were pretty funny, but then you introduce ""real world"" characters into the movie after the first act (as shown in the trailer) and it seems to lose its way. Add to that an oversimplification of the male predicament and expected role in society set against an attempt at a nuanced view of the female's expected role and you're left with...mush?Again, it has some decent satire one moment, but then also attempts to show heart the next. One example is how Ken discovers masculinity, but the way a 10 Year old boy might (trucks and horses), yet Barbie sometimes spouts off a simpleton's take on Camus or Neitzche. Honestly, at some points, there's a weird existential dread that flows out of her mouth, but Ken is kind of a moron.Anyone who views men and women like this in real life might have a hard time maintaining long term, meaningful relationships and should probably seek therapy.I wanted to like this more than I could."
"This movie was supposed to be fun light hearted watch but turns into an obnoxious headache filled with political message on and on and on.The only Relief is honestly Ryan Gosling's Ken who made me crack up multiple times, and he lives as Ken to be honest; there is no Ryan Gosling anymore it's just Ken and he was the protagonist for me.They really show men as cowardly, stupid, needy, power hungry and so on and on. When they showed the real world they could have shown the good and bads parts of it but only the so called patriarchy was shown; like come on. As if it's not already clear for us as audience that all men are horrible and mistreats women we are treated with many monologues of feminism. You would at least think they would go for true equal rights(the thing which actual feminists used to fight for) at the very end but Nooo! The men get satisfied with just 1 seat in that institution instead of it being half and half."
"I came in with no expectations and no idea of the what movie was about... and I was blown away. Under the guise of Barbie's beautiful dreamworld, the movie touches on some very real themes. With that being said, I cried multiple times throughout. The balance between social commentary and comedy was excellent, however. While it occasionally came across heavy handed, that was very much the point and very intentional. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling both do such an amazing job of portraying Barbie and Ken. I will be rewatching to soak everything in for the second time. I highly recommend for everyone to watch!"
"Things I didn't like:
The over the board marketing and publicity (esp about the IP products)
Lack of subtlety.Feels too preachy at some points.The Mattel scenes were little too silly.Like:
Satire hits hard most of the time.Unapologetic and audacious approach.A Strong message and way it is delivered.The mother-daughter dynamics (at most times).Production design and color pallets.Margot Robbie and our guy Ryan almost perfectly playing their parts.Greta Gerwig's direction.Now onto some spoiler-y bit:I think most people just want to gets triggered without putting much thought behind this. They missed the main point.We have to remember that it is a satire and both the Barbie Land and Real World are extreme representations of polarity which is not what we need. I think it does well to deliver the message of why individuality is more important.Also I support how at the end how they didn't just give the Kens the equal status in the councils or whatever because at the end of the day at that very moment, in that fictional world the Barbies were more qualified (by design) to hold those positions and all the Kens have just been are side characters with no ""real"" talents other than being the eye candys to the Barbies. Upliftment on basis of gender and not merit/talent is never a sign of a healthy society . But from now onwards it will not be ""Barbie...and Ken"" but ""it's Barbie and it's Ken"". I think this was the first step towards that balanced and independent world.3.5/5 + 0.5 stars for the sheer audacity to bring forth such a daring topic at such a scale. It will be a 3rd/4th in my list of Greta Gerwig's work."
"I know there's been concern that the movie will be overly feminist because it was written by Greta Grewig. This movie manages to capture the right amount of feminism without taking itself so seriously. The standout performance is Ryan Gosling as Ken; I think he carried his role with the perfect amount of Kenergy. Margot Robbie is delightful as Barbie and gives her much heart.I think the movie would've worked better as a tv series to allow the writers to flesh out the characters a bit more. It would've been better if we understood more of what created the distance between Gloria and her daughter (See? I can't even remember her name). When did Barbie first start feeling that she wanted more than the same existence everyday. Why weren't the Barbies and Kens capable of understanding more than their world? Didn't their characters encompass their human counterparts?Anyway....the movie was fun, lighthearted and something for everyone to enjoy."
"This movie touches on complex themes the way the Truman show and West World were able to do but in a way that was more glittery and a bit more superficial. Because it juxtaposes a world that was created in the imagination of women (Barbieland) vs. Men (the real world), it has a bit of a devastating conclusion for both: mainly that people struggle to live up to ideals, resulting in feelings of alienation and depression that they try to hide. What I appreciated so much about the movie was its commentary on men feeling like they need a ""Barbie"" at their side to feel successful. It occurred in Barbieland but honestly it was a commentary on both men and women who feel that way in both worlds. It's easier to think that someone else will help us determine why we are here instead of really exploring who we are and what our purpose is as individuals. There's a loneliness that rung so true at the heart of the Ken experience. Curious what men thought of it and if they could relate.Set design and visual humor were awesome. Everyone played their role with a lot of heart. My soon to be 11 year old daughter loved it as well. It was just wonderfully entertaining."
"As a skeptical viewer, I went into this expecting cheesy bad. I am happy to say that this movie is fun! Is it for everyone? Absolutely not. It's a great mixture of adult humor and fun and kids humor and fun without ever feeling like it dives into one or the other too much. There's surprisingly a beautiful emotional sequence TWICE and it delivers a great message while poking fun at Barbie and Mattel. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gossling prove to be the amazing actors they are known for and this is packed with a great supporting cast. Yes the plot is thin, yes it's a little bare bones and yes there's some minor pacing things here and there. But for what it is I liked this movie a lot. I will be watching again on streaming!"
"Greta Garwig is a pretty interesting filmmaker as her previous works on ""Lady Bird"" and ""Little Women"" were pretty good. Here, ""Barbie"" is really wild but I had a really fun time watching it. Throughout, the colorful pink designs, models, background, settings and structures were pretty good as it helps add the film's purposeful tone and atmosphere all together. Written by Noah Baumbach, the narrative is pretty good as it's clear the film doesn't take itself seriously and explores some pretty interesting satirical themes that worked well together with the story. All the performances were pretty good especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as they have pretty great chemistry with one another. The characters were really fun to watch as it was fun to see all the Barbies, Kens, Allen, and the real world characters interact and perform on the screen.Many elements like the narrative, structures, tone, humor, and style were pretty good as Garwig's direction and Baumbach's writing helped to carry the film with some great satirical dramatic tones throughout. The soundtrack was pretty good although there were an few soundtracks choice was that were kind of bad (that Ice Spice and Nicki Minaj ""Barbie World"" was horrendous) and a few writing moments that could have been a little better.For the most part, Barbie succeeds because the film understands itself with its non-serious tone and provides a fun and bright entertainment of a film. Oppenheimer and Barbie indeed makes a great double feature."
"As I watched Barbie the Movie, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over me. The vibrant pink color that permeated the film brought back memories of my childhood, when everything seemed so vibrant and full of life.What struck me most about the movie was that it wasn't a typical superhero genre movie, which is so common in today's movie industry. Instead, it was a live-action non-comic book movie that was a breath of fresh air.The movie sets were stunning, with wild and imaginative backgrounds that were so fun to see on a beach. The foreground was equally as enjoyable, with standees that added a touch of whimsy to the film.As I watched the movie, I couldn't help but feel like a kid again. The childhood thoughts and memories that flooded my mind made me feel like I was back in time, experiencing the joy and wonder of childhood all over again.Overall, Barbie the Movie was a pleasure to watch. The imagination and creativity that went into the scene and set construction were seamlessly free-flowing throughout the film. The shocking colors and playful designs were a delight to see and made for an unforgettable movie experience......"
"The movie was very good. It had comic moments, impeccable costumes and exceptional acting, as well as necessary political dialogues. However, despite these strengths, the ending was disjointed and poorly crafted, leaving a sense of dissatisfaction. It felt like the filmmakers were struggling to find a cohesive resolution, resulting in a lackluster conclusion that did not do justice to the well-crafted narrative. While the movie has its merits, the disappointing ending prevents me from considering watching it again. However, it is worth recognizing the film's strengths and the thought-provoking discussions it initiated."
"The most basic touchstone for a movie that I can think of is -- is this worth seeing again? For Barbie the answer is yes. There is so much going on in the background of every scene and such incredible detail and craftmanship. I can imagine Oscars coming for set design or costuming or those kinds of awards.It wasn't quite what I expected. For one thing, it was way more meta than even the trailers indicated. The characters not only switch back and forth from Barbieland to the Real World, but also co-exist both inside and outside the basic storyline. And there were some genuine surprises, like Rhea Perlman's captivating role as Barbie's inventor Ruth Handler, who somehow stands outside everything; and Helen Mirren's wise narrator. There's loads of fun and clever dialog built on the Barbie world, but overall, director Greta Gerwig seems to be using all this as a platform for saying things about women in society and the nature of femininity. Which is what she did in Little Women (2019) but for a different century and place. So there is a Message here that gets a bit heavy by the end, and maybe a bit dated? But that doesn't bring the whole thing down by any means.Every part of this production is incredibly well thought out. Even the action scenes are toy-like in feel, and the dialog at times seems like it's being made up as it goes along, which is just what happens while girls play with dolls. The dance numbers have great choreography, particularly the Kens-in-black-and-white scene that brings to mind things like the Gene Kelly musicals of the 1950's.Another surprise was America Ferrara as Gloria, the real-world and very ordinary woman trying to get along with her prickly daughter (Ariana Greenblatt). Her big scene toward the end where she lets it rip about how hard it is just to make do as a woman -- ending up with her appeal to the Mattel execs to come up with an Average Woman Barbie -- is a real highlight. And then of course there are all the Kens. Ryan Gosling expertly steals just about every scene he's in, but first and foremost, this movie is correctly about Barbie(s) and it stays that way."
"Overall, this movie was about what I expected. It was a fun, summer blockbuster packed with stars and it felt like a nice, fresh break from all the superhero movies and rehashed stories that have been pushed out lately. It's not perfect, and I feel the messaging at times was too blunt, but the elements of the movie that were silly and enjoyable balanced it outPros:
1) best part of the movie is the soundtrack. I really liked it and the song by Billie Eilish that they played at the end has been replaying in my head ever since
2) the cast is also really good. Robbie and Gosling fit the roles perfectly and did a good job of adding layers to otherwise one-dimensional characters
3) the writing was generally pretty good, and there were several scenes that I feel like packed a decent emotional punchCons:
1) probably my biggest con is that the movie isn't very funny. It's written like it should be a comedy; it's silly, it's fun, and it's entertaining, but the jokes aren't that great. Even though the theatre was full, the audience was very quiet during some of the jokes. For example, Will Ferrell tried very hard, but the role he played didn't really have any good jokes to work with. The movie leaned into the silliness of its world, but seemed afraid to lean into the silliness enough in order to make a truly funny film."
"Great visuals but the 'plot' felt like a bunch of stale ideas that the writers were desperate to include but hadn't really thought through. A real missed opportunity to take the discussion forward about changing society's gendered expectations for both men and women. Instead the writers chose our existing system - but with women 'in charge' - as the final outcome even though they had a whole imaginary world at their disposal to explore an alternative. This was not a kid's film but it was quite a childish treatment of an important topic. I fell for the marketing campaign though! It it got me excited to see the film and buy a ticket, but the 'bait and switch' nature of the campaign left me confused and disappointed."
"This might just be the best movie I've ever seen. The more I think about it, the more I realize just how genius it is! I mean they really thought out every little detail!My favorite part is that: if you love this movie, you get the movie. And if you hate the movie, you also get the movie. It truly is a movie for people who love it and hate it. It's for everyone.I'd like to talk about the genius of this plot for a moment. We start off in a matriarchal society. However, it's a society created by little girls, so the Barbies are not violent towards the Kens. They just aren't obsessed with the Kens. The Kens are just in the background, this is representative of how children girls feel. Then, we go into the real world and we are introduced to a patriarchal society. But not just any patriarchal society. It's a society created by adults. So we see toxic masculinity and we see violent tendencies. Then, we go back to Barbieland and Ken brings all of his knowledge of the patriarchy with him. He creates a toxic meninist movement, which emphasizes the point that extremism is not the answer. We cannot overcorrect a mistake or it will cause more mistakes. The Kens start to become violent, even towards each other. This is a good representation of what women deal with in the real world. We can't even rely on each other sometimes. Women can be hateful towards each other as well. Finally, the movie comes to a close with Barbie taking a small step in the right direction. She says it doesn't have to be ""Barbie and Ken"", ""it's Barbie and it's Ken"". Now here's we're people start to get pissed. Barbie just got done saying that the Barbie's and Ken's need to start living as equals, but when when of the Kens asks to be on the Supreme Court the President Barbie says no that's too far, let's start with maybe a cabinet member or something.... Wow how could they... just kidding. You're SUPPOSED TO BE ANGRY about this! This is an accurate representation of the real world! The movie literally ends with the Barbie world being an exact replica of the real world, only with the gender roles reversed.Another thing I'd like to point out is that even Ken says at the end that he didn't really like patriarchy anyway. He just wanted to ride horses. Again, this is because he is a doll in a world created by children. I think there's a lot to unpack here but my overall take was that the world is a better place from the POV of a child and adults are the ones who are ruining everything. Even Mattel is kind of shown as a ""bad guy"" in the movie, but even they say, they didn't make Barbie for her to become a sexualized standard. They made Barbie to allow girls to dream of more than just being a mother. With Barbie they can be anything they want to be. It wasn't until adults came along and taught us to sexualize Barbie, that we started to hold her to a different standard.I think most people watch this movie and see the beauty and the genius of it. I think a few hateful people will watch this movie with their tainted glasses and their preconceived biases and they will get very close to understanding it. Every person I've see criticizing this movie, I'm like you're SO CLOSE to the point. You're basically running head first into it. That is the most frustrating and the most gratifying thing about this movie. It's a trap. You can't say hateful things about it, without PROVING THE POINT OF THE MOVIE!"
"Honestly it's Ryan Gosling that made this movie for me and no not just the holy cow hot body! He's got such a great sense of humour so funny, him and Simu Liu just bounced off each other so well. It's a cute little fun movie if you just want a good laugh. Im still trying to understand Will Ferrells character though, it was very lame and I know he's supposed to be the antagonist but it really did not work for me.The sets and the costumes were fantastic exactly how I imagined my Barbie used to live-😁. I think they could have dug a little deeper and done multi-era costumes, regardless it was just a lot of fun to watch!"
"I have questions: when the kens take over Barbie land, they see the Barbies as just accessories but then when the Barbies just swap places every ken still had a Barbie why would they even care as long as they still have a pretty thing listening? I just feel like that scene was kind of random and odd I guess. I still enjoy the film overall it was very visually appealing. Will ferrells character was just cheap laughs, nothing new for him. He's too childlike to believe he intends any ill will for barbie so it really takes the wind out of the movies sails. Also the parallels between this and don't worry darling and they have the same flaw in my opinion. An unclear driving force of why this is happening now - randomly thinking about death? I would have preferred to have seen her be picked up in the real world and then the reveal that it was gloria and not the daughter could have been a more significant moment and they could have fleshed out Gloria's yearning for girlhood more and why she played with the dolls."
"In the hands of another filmmaker, a ""Barbie"" film could have been a bland or soulless cash-grab just seemingly made to sell more of the iconic Mattel doll. But cinephiles know that Greta Gerwig's short-but-no-less-impressive track record of writing and directing is nothing short of superb, having made two outstanding films (2017's ""Lady Bird"" and 2019's ""Little Women."") Gerwig's films are always rooted in deep emotional affection and a profound understanding of womanhood with a level of emotional authenticity rarely seen in major Hollywood films. These levels of depth in her films are complemented by exceptionally clever and often funny writing. Needless to say, her take on ""Barbie"" is exceptional and certainly lives up to the seemingly earth-shattering hype. Gerwig and Baumbach's satirical screenplay is consistently hilarious from beginning to end, while depicting and analyzing themes related to feminism in a thoughtful and profound way. The film brilliantly threads the needle between being summer popcorn entertainment and being something far more original, creative, insightful, and clever than simply just that. The film's jokes come rapid-fire and are consistently hilarious in an intelligent way, even also poking fun at plenty of pop culture and film-related references that cinephiles will adore.The consistently entertaining and uproarious script is made more impactful by great performances from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, who are both absolutely joys to watch as Barbie and Ken, respectively. The supporting cast is great too, with standouts being Kate McKinnon and America Ferrera. Another standout of the film is the superb production design and associated aesthetic qualities of Barbie Land, which is absolutely stunning to look at visually. While the film's tone is often comedic (which is great, given how clever and funny it is,) its more serious themes are still handled very sensitively, including a very powerful monologue from America Ferrera and an emotionally engaging resolution to the story. Sharp, incisive, original, and fun, ""Barbie"" is an outstanding movie that audiences will remember long after the credits roll, and I truly can't wait for Gerwig's next film. 9.5/10."
"Firstly, the marketing for Barbie was great. The cinema was full of people wearing Pink when I watched Barbie on Friday and Oppenheimer on Saturday.Greta Gerwig largely succeeded in creating a fun film that gets her message across although it sometimes became a bit heavy handed at the expense of the narrative and tempo of the Movie.Barbie takes on the noble cause of trying to undo the message portrayed by its early history, reposition the expectations of females (and Barbie dolls) and shine a light on the patriarchy which exists in our society. It's a movie based on a kids toy but aimed at an older demographic who can internalise these messages.The opening act was fantastic. We were introduced to a fantasy Barbie Land which is everything we could have hoped for. The set design in immense and filled with predominantly modern day Barbies living their dream life in Doll houses. Margot Robbie, who plays ''stereotypical Barbie' was made for the roll and Ryan Gosling is great as Ken. The supporting cast are also a lot of fun.In the second act we are given a cause to enter the Real World where we are introduced to Will Ferrall and the Mattel Corporation. They were the least interesting part of the movie. One of the main issue is that they weren't realistic and blurred the lines between the tone of Barbie Land and the real world. Whilst some of their jokes were funny a number of them missed, something that was true of the movie as a whole. We are also introduced to other real world characters who have a bigger role to play.In the third act, things pick up again as we are able to explore Barbie Land. We get an stand-off between competing ideologies which is largely entertaining and funny. In this act there are a number key moments which reinforce the message of the film followed by several resolutions which may or may not please the general audience. There are parts of this act which could have been done better especially when it comes to the overall workings of Barbie Land.Barbie teased being a simple movie about a doll and instead went for the bigger goal of being a strong feminist movie and calling out the patriarchy. Overall there is a lot of fun to be had with the Barbie movie. It aims to deliver a positive message to its core audience however this sometimes comes at the expense of the narrative and tempo of movie as a whole.I never imagined that there would be so many thoughts and discussion to have post a Barbie movie. If you are caught up in The Barbie hype it's worth seeing in the cinema otherwise watch it when it is released to the masses."
"Barbie was so much better than I expected it to be, I thought it would be fun but it definitely nailed everything it went for.While not taking itself seriously as a comedy, it still manages to touch on important topics like inequality. It holds up a mirror that will make some people feel uncomfortable, and this can be seen by some reviews calling it ""preachy"".The performances were so perfect for their respective characters and they did a good job of establishing everyone's role in the story. The story itself had great pacing and kept you interested the whole way throughout.The great thing about Barbie is that it touches on worlds dominated by either Men or Women are both wrong, and the key is finding balance and equality. The Barbie showing opposite sides of the real world.It also had great positive masculinity, especially during the Ken fight, they could have just gone for a generic case of them fighting each others and looking like they can't control themselves. Instead they had them overcome their differences and appreciate each other.I also appreciate they gave Ken a good ending too, having his character not be defined by being with Barbie, and instead being proud of just being himself. Which again, parallels the pressure on Women being defined by their partner.A certain crowd won't understand any of the points made by this movie and will just call it ""preachy"" some reviews I've read on here have definitely not watched the movie.It's a fun comedy that will make you laugh and also think, overall a great experience and will likely be the film of the year."
"I watched this movie on an IMAX theater in my hometown (Qatif); it's considered a 70MM
cinema in our standards.. As everything was vividly pink, that particular experience made my eyes very sore!! Despite that, I can safely
say that the Barbie film is somehow a funny ridiculous film and I would confidently recommend to watch it over watching Nolan masterpiece of garbage (oppenheimer).Is it boring? Mayyyybe but I don't think so.. does it need a 70MM IMAX? The answer is No No and No.. However, I strongly recommend to go and watch it in 70MM IMAX for the following reasons: the acting is acceptable; the plot is extremely silly; nudity and sex are alomst Zerrrro; you will witness different kinds of Barbie e.g. Skinny, overweight Barbie and more..
Simply put, it wins the Oscar for the most ridiculous movie of the year. So, stop the hate and go give it a genius try."
"Where to begin? With flamboyance of Barbie and the emotions of Greta Gerwig, this is the best release of the year so far. To address it all to mothers, specifically, and STILL touch the hearts of girls all around. To talk so, SO honestly about what it's like being a girl. To say it in the first ten minutes - ""I can have feelings and use logic at the same time and it does not take away from my worth."" to have Barbie look at her body and hate it and to make her look at an old woman and see just how beautiful her ""imperfections"" make her. To make it about growing up, but also about remaining a child. To remind girls to be both. To make the perfect example of what adolescence means to a girl. Just genius."
"Just watched the première of Barbie with my wife, my daughter and my son. I'm pleasantly surprised. Sure, it's a fun movie and Margot Robbie is gorgeous as Barbie (and Ryan Gosling is a perfect Ken). But the movie is, in fact, an interesting commentary on, both, patriarchy (and the negative effects Barbie dolls have had over the years) as well as on mortality. The movie is more profound than I would have thought. I'm also pleasantly surprised by the open-mindedness and humour of Mattel. What is missing is that the movie sometimes lacks intensity and becomes only candy for the eyes.I'm giving 7/10 to Barbie."
"How did I go to watch Barbie, only to have seen a mildly depressing unecessarily deep movie saturated with politics and talk of mental health. The plot made no sense.For someone who has grown up and loved watching all the classics, it was a disappointment. Most women like to watch feel-good chick flicks as an escape from reality, and for the same reason, girls like to watch Barbie. But it was nothing like that, and instead I left the cinema feeling LITERALLY depressed. As a little girl, not a single part of me thought the old Barbie movies presented a Barbie who wasn't a strong figure. And yes, you can be strong, WHILE being in love.The way the movie was filmed was truly a work of art, but the plot made NO sense despite them trying to constantly spoon-feed it to us.In Barbie land the women (the barbies) are in charge and have everything while the men (the Kens) are nobodies with absolutely no power and are treated like nobodies. They dont even have houses. When Barbie enters the real word, she realises its the complete reverse. You'd think that Barbie would then REALISE that how she was being treated is how the barbies were treating the kens, then go back to Barbie land and FIX it. Instead, when she goes back to see Ken turning Barbie-land into Ken-land (because the poor sod had a taste of what it feels like to be appreciated when he was in the real world), she has a crisis and then gathers the barbies to MANIPULATE the kens into FIGHTING each other so they can take back their power. Then instead of apologising to Ken (who was genuinely in love with her and had no TRUE bad intentions the entire movie - he thought the patriarchy was about horses) about how she constantly brushed him off like an annoying child every 5 seconds, she simply apologises for not spending some time with him, then continues to reject him and tells him he essentially needs to FIND himself. Then she wants to become human despite fighting to maintain her perfection throughout the movie, simply because someone told her its ok to be imperfect - and I get what they're trying to achieve here but I thought there would be a deeper reason? Perhaps there are things about being an imperfect human that are valuable? Such as having empathy, or maybe make it obvious that she was becoming a more realistic role model for little girls by becoming human with cellulite?I get the intention of the movie, but it really didn't have to be that deep? I REALLY just wanted to have fun at a Barbie movie. The last thing you'd want to go watch after a long day at work or school is a movie about a silly fight between men and women, politics, patriarchy, death, depression and anxiety. The beginning of the film was fun, but that fun didn't last long. But people are probably gonna call us the brainwashed barbies because we actually want men to be our equals."
"To me, Barbie was a wonderful exploration of feminity and womanhood while also encompassing themes of patriarchy and the entitlement of men. I wasn't really sure what to expect beforehand but i was truly enjoying it and smiling nearly the whole time. It pains me, how all women and girls will be able to relate to some of the scenes and it angers me so much how men seeing this movie just hate it for the sake of hating something pink and fun.Men aside, i do think it healed something in me, however cliché it sounds and i will gladly rewatch it (would definitely show it to my future daughter, if i planned to have one). I think it's an incredible celebration of femininity and i think women deserve to enjoy every second of it without having to worry about anything or anyone else <3."
"Me and my friend have been dying to see this film for months, we thought it would be a funny silly movie but its was so much more.There were so many emotional scenes that left me on the verge of tears the ending scene was honestly so incredibly emotional but it was amazing.Margot robbie was an amazing casting choice she played the role of barbie so fantastically, the casting choice for ken could have been better but honestly ryan gosling did amazing at his role aswell.Honestly this movie healed my inner child it was so amazing and i definitely recommend you go and see it because the movie actually is very funny but you probably will end up tearing up at some point."
"Whilst not being a particular fan of (overly kooky) writer/actor/director Greta Gerwig or the recent efforts of her husband and Co writer Noah Bambaugh, this surprised me as a sharp and hugely enjoyable Toy Story/Trueman Show mash up, that will appeal to most families.Margot Robbie is excellent in the lead, much better than the over caffeine performance she gave in Babylon this year, she shows great heart and soul with good comic timing.As does Ryan Gosling, who like Colin Farrell can actually do comedy. He isn't afraid of showing himself up.It's well written and has something to say. It's also well shot and designed.Even Will Ferrell is good, though he's in a supporting role, so that helps!Out of all the summer blockbusters this year, this is the winner- and yes it's better than Oppenheimer!I could watch it again, something I couldn't do with aforementioned film."
"When you have a cast as big as this film the space for error is low, and although the movie is lots of fun there are still some nitpicks. Lots of the jokes don't land but the ones that do really make you laugh. Margot Robbie gives a great performance and is going to be remembered as barbie for ever. Will Ferrell is very under utilised for such an iconic actor. There's some emotional stuff at the end and that didn't really resonate with me that much, but it might be different for other people. But the best part of this film is Ryan Gosling as Ken let alone all the Kens are great, the musical number and fight they have at the end is the absolute best part of the movie."
"Barbie has exceeded the expectations of many viewers, what we thought was going to be a movie for ""kids"" has ended up being a movie full of social criticism, satire and a great sense of humor. The female empowerment that Greta Gerwig presents to us is relentless, showing various situations in which women find themselves involved on a daily basis, as well as various cliches that surround them.On the other hand, there is Ken who at first finds patriarchy as the best solution for society, but finally realizes that the role of women is extremely important and that without them society would collapse.The way in which Barbie has been shot is impressive, the mixture of the use of animated elements with life action makes seeing Barbie on the big screen a unique experience. I loved the duo of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, they have coexisted perfectly in Barbieland, making watching them act extremely entertaining.Without a doubt, this movie is one of a kind and I would like it to be valued for what it really is and not be forgotten like the movie about Barbie."
"The Barbie movie is a mixture of comedy and an analysis of an old era idea, using scenery that rivals classics like Playtime, and a cast that was clearly hand-picked with stars like Margot Gosling and Farrell. The movie features an astonishing soundtrack, including Ice Spice, Dua Lipa, Tame Impala, Billie, and much more. Barbie's presentation is top-notch, and some might even say it couldn't be any better (I would've agreed). However, the writing itself doesn't quite match its other impressive traits. Despite adapting the boring and monotonous toy line into something actually interesting on the big screen, it felt throughout the movie that the ideas of the writers were too disjointed. This led the director to piece together a self-exploration story with a modern world outlook, topped with media manipulation and a critique of society from a male perspective, with a side dish of a womanly critique of society. Safe to say, not every point got across as intended.The plot starts in Barbie Land, where we witness Robbie's character's journey and her existential quest. Concerned for her designated child's fate due to the villainous scholiosis, the tall blonde takes action. The movie's second part shifts to real-life segments, offering hilarious situations with Ken & Barbie. The perfect doll believes she's found her child but faces an unwelcome surprise, realizing the world is the opposite of her magical land; nobody admires loving Barbies, and the Kens are the ones in control. In contrast, the muscular blonde embraces and reshapes his former land into a fratboy utopia. After finding her true partner in the child's mother and returning to Barbie Land, the toy discovers its destruction under a horse-loving, Mojo Dojo Casa House Living, and beer-drinking government. With a pep talk from her former playmate, she learns about womanhood and reclaims her home using girl power.And this, without the inclusion of Matel and the ending. It tries to reach for the stars with the juggling of three major themes, but it has the wings of Icarus, represented by its 2-hour runtime.The main three themes are the search for one's self, the media prying on those who are deeply insecure, and the question of womanhood's position in society. However, not all themes were treated equally. The search for one's self, for example, had a great realization with the protagonist slowly becoming different from the others, becoming weird as the movie put it, and ending with the pursuit of reality, not succumbing to a safe bubble but embracing the truth fully. On the other hand, the theme of womanhood feels somewhat forced in the end, taking away from the main conflict.The movie starts the process of exploring this theme with the conflict between Barbie and the child of her owner, showing that Barbie isn't as glorious as she felt. However, after this, nothing truly develops. The kid joins the journey and sees that Barbie is a woman just like her, which doesn't really correlate with anything before that. To be honest, it feels more like a relatable moment rather than an actual thing, but I guess that is what solves the big Kenland problem. The middle ground gets taken by the character arc of Ken, and his performance steals the show, but the way it's solved pretty much trivializes the issue Ken was facing, making it an unsatisfying ending that boils down to 'Men are big dumb-dumbs' is extremely unfortunate, as it was, in my opinion, the most interesting part of the movie. However, you can't really rival 'I am just Ken' part.Something even more unfortunate was Farrell's character. He's such a good actor, but he was incredibly wasted in this role. I understand that it's a Barbie movie and kids will be there, and making the man in the suit dumb will make hilarious jokes for toddles. However, couldn't they you know, not put Farrell? His role doesn't really scream expertise, and other than that, they aren't even plot-relevant. I feel like if they just cut this part entirely, the movie would have had a lot more to gain. Besides, the movie is PG-13, so they don't really need to consider slapstick comedy (sorry for offending Mr. Bean Fans).In conclusion, the Barbie movie is surprisingly more than Ken-ough. It provides an amazing soundtrack and even better performances. However, it didn't deliver that well in its plot points. I wouldn't say it's a must-see, but you might be missing out if you don't watch it."
"Is Barbie a shrewd satire? Despite the existence of two divided factions, in this case, men versus women, which is somewhat comical given that the dispute revolves around whether Barbie's message is ""correct"" or not, the film can be appreciated by both female and male audiences. The work addresses highly delicate themes that are complicated to consider in today's society, as they inevitably generate controversy.Nevertheless, the film achieves this with a genuinely humorous approach, inserting clever jokes in moments where the plot becomes dense, interrupting the atmosphere and eliciting laughter from a significant portion of the audience. Personally, while experiencing this situation, I was one of the few gentlemen who attended the screening individually, surrounded by women, and I delighted in the subtly acidic references and humor about current affairs.I greatly enjoyed how the film incorporates references to other cinematic classics, such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""The Godfather,"" two films that are historically revered as some of the best of all time. Moreover, the work addresses contemporary controversies, such as patriarchy, feminism, and the stereotypes imposed on bodies deemed ""perfect.""I won't delve into the details of the plot, as it unfolds linearly, as expected in this film. Its development is solid and fitting, focused on a main objective of exposing the marked contrast between our sociocultural reality and a fictional dimension imbued with idealized visions. I must express my surprise at this creation since it was expected that it would merely promote a new collection of Barbie dolls or evoke superficial nostalgia, yet it turned out to be precisely the opposite.One aspect that I would like to emphasize is the careful selection of actors, where Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling embody the stereotype of beauty, both female and male, that society deems ""perfect."" Both actors, in their respective roles, present themselves as vulnerable to various challenges inherent to their genders. The film conveys a message that despite possessing a body considered ""perfect"" or conforming to the Barbie stereotypes, it does not negate the possibility of experiencing distress, sadness, fatigue from wearing heels, or confronting the presence of cellulite, ultimately preventing us from being everything we aspire to be. This message intertwines with the reality of women in modern times, addressing the complexities and challenges they face in their daily lives.The film fulfills its objective by serving as a critique of society, admittedly leaning towards an unfavorable perspective on the male gender while taking for granted the superiority of the female gender. As a man, I personally was not offended by the jokes directed at the male gender in the film; on the contrary, I appreciated how the film vividly portrays the simplicity, happiness, and lack of complications that we, as men, can achieve.Without further ado, adorned with a rosy hue and brief musical moments that do not overwhelm, adding to Barbie's experience, even though it is targeted at a specific audience, it proves to be exceptionally enjoyable. Therefore, I wholeheartedly recommend it. After all, who wouldn't want to laugh at themselves while acknowledging our human nature, filled with imperfections?"
"Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" is a stunning piece of cinema when it comes to costume and set design which blew me away with. Also had good songs and catchy musical numbers but was not as good as expected. With a film being called ""Barbie"" Margot Robbie was great as usual, but Ryan Gosling's Ken was the one who absolutely stole the show with it being his funniest role to date. Now the first 10-15 minutes were rough to get through for myself with the introduction to Barbie world, which is understandable considering what it is. But then even leading into the ""Real-World"" part of the film some of it still had the cheesy bits that I didn't like. From that point on though I did end up enjoying most of the film and the performances from everyone on screen. Overall, the good moments outweigh the bad ones and it ending up being a good fun/comedy film."
"""Barbie: So Clever and Colourfully Fantastic!"" is a cinematic masterpiece, gracefully dancing between hilarity and heartfelt emotion. This modern gem captivates with fantastic acting and a vibrant kaleidoscope of colors, embracing the theme of being ordinary and finding one's true self in a world that often celebrates the extraordinary. Refreshingly, it focuses on genuine connections, friendships, and personal growth instead of romance, making it enchanting without clichés. The talented cast delivers outstanding performances, while the visuals and captivating dance sequences create moments of pure cinematic magic. ""Barbie"" strikes the perfect balance between humour and gravitas, making it a touching and relatable exploration of self-discovery. A delightful fusion of ""Elf"" and ""Pinocchio,"" it charms audiences worldwide, transcending age and background. For an uplifting and soulful movie experience, ""Barbie"" is the perfect cinematic gem."
"Greta Gerwig's latest offering, ""Barbie"", starring the effervescent Margot Robbie and the charismatic Ryan Gosling, had high expectations to meet. The film provides an ample amount of humor and maintains an enjoyable pace. However, it falls short of its potential as a sharp, thought-provoking commentary on our society's obsession with aesthetic perfection and constructed identities.First, let's talk about the performances. Margot Robbie is fantastic in her role as Barbie, breathing life into the plastic figurine with an effortlessly humorous and convincing portrayal. Her comedic timing is impeccable, and her delivery of the lines lands smoothly every time, making for a lot of laughs.Unfortunately, Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken didn't manage to hit the same high notes. As a Gosling enthusiast myself, it's disappointing to witness his usually nuanced performance taking a backseat. His portrayal was overdone, his actions and dialogue feeling more like caricature than character. However, considering the history of Gerwig's adept directing, it's plausible to believe the responsibility for this creative choice doesn't lie solely with Gosling.As a social commentary, ""Barbie"" delivers some pointed insights into our societal norms and expectations but, frustratingly, its treatment of these complex themes often feels too overt, which detracts from the potential impact. The film's humor, though consistently amusing, lacks the subtlety that could have transformed it into a more incisive satire.The musical elements of the film were, interestingly, among its strongest aspects. The colorful, campy musical numbers added to the film's eccentricity, and it's a shame these weren't more of a focus. Their quirky charm offered a delightful contrast to the sometimes too-obvious comedy of the rest of the film.While it was an entertaining watch, ""Barbie"" didn't quite meet the high expectations I had for a Gerwig-directed social commentary. However, this may be more a testament to the immense respect I have for her previous work than a damning critique of the film itself. It's still an enjoyable movie, full of laughs and energy, and Margot Robbie's performance alone is worth the price of admission.In conclusion, while ""Barbie"" may not have been as witty or sharp as hoped, it still provides a solidly entertaining viewing experience. Despite its flaws, it's a fun film that will keep you laughing throughout and offer a few insights to chew on."
"To say that I was disappointed is an understatement. The movie starts fine which is more or less what was advertised in the trailers where the setting was Barbie. That was kind of fun. The problem is that the second part is just a mess in pace, it tries tooooo hard to be funny. The main message of the movie would have been great if it had been delivered properly. It was nowhere close to be succint. All Pixar movies do a better job at making their point. And for me, the worst of all, is that it tried to be controversial so hard that it became stale and dull after some minutes since everything centered around the same topic.Movies should try to unite not divide. At least create some discussion rather than being a one-way discussion where the writer basically tells everything.Parents: Not recommended to bring kids, it is not for them. It can be dull and the jokes are not aimed at that audience.Despite all of these problems, it deserves points for the first 30 mins of the movie, and the aesthetic."
OMG IT IS SO GOOD especially for young woman! It is so inspiring and really shows everything Barbie is. I think this movie is good for all ages because it will teach all woman how life really is and it will teach young girls the reailty of this world and how to prepare for obstacles that come there way. This movie was funny as well as informing and I didn't expect this plot at all from this movie. I would see this again becuase it is just that good and I think out would needs to turn to Barbie land because there world is fair and I wish we could be like that. It is so amazing so so so good 5/5.
"Okey, I get it now.Firstly, any comparation with Oppenheimer is out of place. It's something of conjuction and in 5 years nobody will ever put them side by side in a discussion. Both just used this brilliant marketing gimmick to bring people in the cinema. They succeded.Right, now about the film. It's fine, it's funny. It has memes. It also has a social commentary regarding genders and their power in society. All fine and dandy but the only conclusion to this is that we all are in a bad spot and only together can get this world on the right track. If you think it's anything else than that you are wrong and should feel bad. Haha.I saw this with my wife and she asked me to say something nice about it. I think I did her justice. The change message rings true and strong. Only evolving we will be better together."
"It's hard to say this movie isn't great even if you don't agree with the third act feminism part. I mean, Margot Robbie nailed it! And Ryan Gosling... come on, i was expecting so much from him, and he was even better than i tought, so freaking funny and always on point! The set production and Costume design are, of course, oscar nominees already.Overall i liked the message, the social critic, the perfomances, the production, the jokes were very funny, the references... what's there not to like? Such an enjoyable movie. Perhaps the part played by America Ferrera required a most skilled actress to carry the emotive part of the movie and the monologue in a more convincing way, but that doesn't ruin the movie at all. I think it's a must watch for cinema lovers and for people who just wanna have a good time as well."
"I knew going into Barbie that I was in for a visual feast. The trailers showcased the wonderful set design, costumes, and performances already. But I was not expecting how affecting this movie would be.Greta Gerwig proves for yet a third time that women's stories are worth telling with Barbie. Only she could look at the plastic empire and find a story about what it means to be a woman in a society that hates them. What's miraculous is she does this all while also proving that men still suffer in an unequal society as well. It's such a careful examination of the culture we live in, but it's also absolutely hysterical and includes some of the hardest laughs I've had at the movies all year.I know Greta's next project is a massive IP blockbuster, and while some might be worried that she's selling out, I'm not. She'll find new meaning to add in whatever she does."
At the interval I was surprised of how much I was enjoying Barbie with its amazing humour which was super ironic and subtle commentary on male patriarchy and consumerism. The overall theme of the movie was also quite good reflecting many aspects of human life and how it becomes more critical with age. But it was so disappointing in the third act which takes away the brilliant build up. Ryan Gosling showed his ranged and made me laugh so many times. Margot Robbie shined brilliantly just like she does during the whole film. But I expected more from Barbie and Greta Gerwig didn't satisfy me. She should have tried for a different sort of ending.
"This is.... Was.... Admirably!I'm absolutely delighted!I don't want to write, it's a huge review of Barbie, therefore:
""Barbie"" is a great philosophical film to think about and laugh about.I think that this tape will appeal to everyone, from collectors of Barbie dolls and those who rummage around in the Barbie universe (like me, for example) and ending with those people who do not know anything about it at all.Margot Robbie is the perfect Barbie; Ryan Gosling is silly, but chic and perfect Ken. Their tandem is gorgeous, every time they were, together; I was very pleased to see them.Also, I was very pleased to see John Cena, Dua Lipa and Kate McKinnon. They're gorgeous.The jokes in Barbie are orious, and in the finale I roared.The plot is excellent, interesting, easy and, as I wrote above, philosophical.I haven't watched Oppenheimer yet, but I already think that Barbie is a more serious film against it!The soundtrack of ""Barbie"" is wonderful; I listen to it every day now.In general, I did not notice the disadvantages of Barbie, but noticed some advantages.As a result, ""Barbie"" is an ideal, wonderful film to laugh and be sad and think.I put the tape 10 out of 10 and if you have it in cinemas, then run and watch it!IT'S WORTH WATCHING ON THE BIG SCREEN!!"
Now please take into consideration that I am a man. And a white man at that.Barbie was much better than I thought it was going to be. I'm just going to get into what I didn't like. Barbie starts off as a fun light hearted comedy movie. The first 30 mins are great! From then on the movie begins to have an identity crisis. It goes from deep feminist themes to a car commercial to a slide show to a 4th wall break depression Barbie ad and then a musical. One of my biggest problems was that I felt like the movie was talking to the audience too much. Things were being said or done visually in the movie not for the sake of the story but for the audience. Which maybe some people like but to me it kinda took me out of the experience.Barbie wanted to be taken seriously but because of its inability to be consistent and justify the actions of certain characters and events it left the audience behind.Like what is the purpose of Mr. Buisness(Will Ferrall)? Is he good? Is he evil? Does he care? Does he just want money? Why does he ask like a Barbie but he's from the real world?At the end of the day I agree with a lot of what was being said and the themes that were built. I just don't think the movie is for me... at all. But I didn't hate it and Ryan Gosling gets a 💯/10.
"I loved to watch the movie, it had all elements one would have want to have seen. The journey of barbie to the real world was something I was really looking forward it and I am quite satisfied with it completely , the movie had lovely humour and I was completely mesmerized by Ryan's character it gave a very balanced effect to the movie, there could be a point where the movie felt very overwhelming due to a lot of factors but it was quite a journey to look forward to, the audience was very pleased around me and everyone had a lot of fun watch it. It seems like a fun movie with a very deep meaning behind, the ending was very unexpected and gave a twist very similar to the truman show."
"Greta Gerwig, took the most famous doll of humanity, a luxury cast and made a good film with an important message!Barbie offers almost 120 minutes of fun, captivating and fluid moments. Mixing real elements with ""drawn"" scenarios, it manages to bring the two worlds together in a balanced and intelligent way, varying between ""cartoons"" and the real world.It also shows in a very intelligent way all the difficulties that women go through in their lives, such as the lack of respect for their intellectual and physical property, as well as illustrating a series of moments that illustrate patriarchy and the disrespectful way in which many men treat women and think they are superior based on their gender. A message that Ryan Gosling had in a great performance to emphasize the perspective that unfortunately still reigns in many men today.Speaking of the cast, Ryan Gosling had a script that favored him, with several scenes and different roles that allowed him to show all his versatility as an actor, and the reality is that he delivered a high-level performance, the best in the film imo, and that he managed not only to give strength to the message that he wanted to convey, but also to elevate the film to another level with his musical performances. On the other hand, imo, Margot had a script that didn't exploit all of his acting skills. Don't get me wrong, her acting is very good, within what was provided, the performance is very good, however I think the script could have given her more, due to the versatility she has!And my first negative point is precisely that. The script was too attached to the message it wanted to convey and did not use all the potential that ""Barbie"" provided, such as the affective side and its overall positive impact on many women. Furthermore, the focus on the concept limited the development of characters and a cast that had more to offer!The dialogues also suffer from a lot of fluctuations, the good dialogues are really good but seem very disconnected from the rest, as the construction even them felt lazy. It's as if they didn't connect to what just happened in the last few minutes and just came out of nowhere. It's a shame, because there are really good speeches!Finally, the message got across clearly and the most important thing is clearly retained. This movie was never about pink or a doll. It was about women and the rights they are due! Respect, freedom, and justice in relation to the opportunities they should have. Doors should open according to the work carried out and the skills demonstrated, never to the gender or color of a person! Love is love no matters what. Respect is to everyone, there's no ""but""! However, I think Greta missed an incredible opportunity to make a stronger ""statement"" about equal rights, duties and opportunities for all!In short, it's a good film, light, funny and entertaining, and can be watched several times as something to ""pass the time and have fun"" but should be watched, at least once, in a serious and dedicated way for all the message it has!"
"Summary: This isn't the fun, light-hearted fantasy the marketing would have you believe. It is instead a clunky film that is nearly all social commentary. In fact, the plot and protagonist of the film is the patriarchy and more specifically men. The result is a sexist film that can be good at times but frustrating for many viewers. The movie may even be damaging to woman (explanation below).Full Review:I will justify my summary above but I want to first share that the film has a tremendous amount of potential and that I will be looking forward to a sequel should it come out. The cast is excellent. Gosling absolutely steals the show and is clearly having a ton of fun. Robbie is also a gem and is the quintessential Barbie. They could not have picked a better cast. The set design was fun and probably exactly what you would hope for in a Barbie film. The tempo was great, the cameos were fun, the movie was appropriately self-aware, the humor generally landed well. It's probably not a kids movie and I think that I wouldn't want my kids to attend it do to the adult humor and the social commentary bit. I think that for the right audiences the social commentary might elicit some good discussions and may be interesting to some.I don't mind social commentary but I'd prefer to know that its in the film before I go. If I do go see a movie with social commentary its not generally as clunky as the movie Barbie is. For example, after the movie I asked several people what they thought was the message of the movie and no one person had the same answer. Surely the message centers around feminism or woman's empowerment. These are themes that generally everyone can get behind but the movie isn't clear on specifics. Does the movie intend to convey that Barbie is problematic as a doll or symbol? Is the movie suggesting the patriarchy is a problem? Is it that woman can do anything they put their mind to it? Is it saying the diversity is important? Basically... the movie fails to pinpoint what exactly it is trying to comment on.Generally if you go see a movie that is intended to be social commentary then you should come out of it with thought provoking questions and ideas. It should be a movie that ""flips the script"" so that if you are on the opposite side of an issue you become more aware/informed after watching the movie. Unfortunately Barbie doesn't do this. Barbie lives in a fantasy world but the real world n the film is also a fantasy. She doesn't face any real world or realistic dilemma causing us to evaluate the gender systems we have in place. Even the times Barbie is subjected to discrimination or sexism (which is fairly constant) these times are not realistic or believable. Thus the commentary comes off as preachy and anecdotal.Barbie is also not a role model or a hero in the movie. It's weird watching a movie that is written to empower woman while also featuring a weak and sexist female lead. The film begins with Barbie dismissing men and being biased towards woman. I don't want to leave any spoilers but.... SEMI-SPOILER... the movie ends with things being unequal between the sexes. As a result the film almost suggests that the sexes shouldn't be treated equally. In other words, its clear Barbie and Barbie the movie believes females are the superior gender.Moreover, Barbie is not a strong and powerful woman. We are told in the movie that Barbie is an inspiration to woman fairly constantly. Normally I would agree. But the Barbie in this movie is depicted as uncapable and weak. She is egocentric and motivated by a desire to be beautiful. In fact, the entire plot kicks off because she finds cellulite on her legs and it later revolves around her self-centered interests to maintain power in her community. Its hard to relate or feel sympathetic under these circumstances and if anything the plot is an indictment on woman's (and societies) overuse of beauty and sexuality. As Barbie trots along her path she doesn't overcome anything on her own and she doesn't change as a person. In fact, everything she ""accomplishes"" is because someone told her what to do or because someone else did something for her. Not one time can I recall did Barbie accomplish something on her own or reevaluate her positions. By the end of the movie she is still the same problematic Barbie we were first introduced to. This is an interesting problem because it means that Ken, the movie's antagonist is actually the hero of the film. He is the only one in the film that overcomes adversity and is the only one in the film who grows and changes. We don't root for Ken, of course, but if you spend a few minutes thinking about his character arch you will realize he is actually the victim and the hero of the movie. This is what I meant by saying it is a clunky film - it has too many mixed messages, unexplored and unrealistic themes, and watered down but constant social commentary. Then add the fact that the social commentary expressed in the film is of a serious issue but is juxtaposed with a lighthearted comedic tone.Then there is the problem with the movie's portrayal of men and specifically Ken. First, lets acknowledge how woman have been poorly portrayed in past by depicting them as weak and needing men. We can agree its inappropriate - so its confusing as to why the film does the same thing, except to men. Ken is portrayed as inferior to Barbie in every way when the appropriate thing to do would be highlight the strengths in both genders. A counter argument people may make is, ""Dude, its just a movie about a doll and its a fantasy land."" I get it, its not real. But the problem is the movie depicts men as inferior and stupid in both the fantasy and real world. In fact, there is little distinction between the men in both worlds. On the other hand, the woman in the real world are depicted more genuinely and certainly more intelligently. This leads me to conclude that the writers likely do have a problem with men even if they were trying to be humorous. In fact, there is a whole subplot with an all male corporate board that seems to be a non-sequitur. It seems its only purpose in the film was to dump on men or, in the alternative, the whole subplot was intended to be something intelligent but ended up being too poorly conceived to be meaningful in any way.So, I have to say the film is disappointing and problematic in so many ways. But the potential is huge. I would look forward to a sequel but they have to drop the social commentary or, in the alternative, make a more cohesive movie with less mixed signals. Barbie should demonstrate why she is so amazing and earn her place at the top. We don't see why she is special or see her become the hero in her own movie. I expected to see a movie about a powerful woman who also likes to have fun. What I got instead was a bait and switch."
"This movie was so perfect especially as someone who has grown up with Barbie and was in pure awe of her from birth to the age of 12. I was forced to grow up due to peer pressure when I hit twelve so bye bye Barbie. I always regretted doing that because I wasn't ready to say goodbye but everyone else my age was. It breaks my soul seeing young girls, younger than I was letting go of their childhood so quick, trying to keep up with the older teen trends. It breaks my soul because if I was one of those girls I would be crying for my Barbie while conforming to society. Gloria's speech absolutely rocked my world. I need that tattooed in my brain, Greta is an absolute inspiration to women and girls everywhere. One thing about Barbie is I would not have an education without her. When I started school I refused to do my work unless I was promised a Barbie when I returned home, and it worked. If Barbie had not inspired women so long ago, I would probably not have completed my education as I would have found there to be no point. One thing is that I am sad or is a Barbie movie for one reason only, men will not likely see this. My brother and dad had no interest in even looking at promotion or trailers, there is no way I can get them to see this masterpiece, and they NEED to see this it is so important. If there is one movie that can change the course of history it is this one, as the introduction of Barbie did. I'm so proud and excited for Greta Gerwig and what is to come. As a newly out of school 18 year old my passion is to become a director or an actress, and Greta's work delights me everyday because of Greta, I have a chance. Before Greta's movie, I actually never heard of a female director in film, so it never even came into my head as a possibility before Greta came in. This movie has come at a perfect time for me as I turned 18 last month so this is my kickstart to womanhood, and what a way to start. I ask every woman and girl to watch this and I ask them to drag whichever man in their lives that they can. This movie is the epitome of ""yes"" there are no other words to perfectly signify this. Now, after all the mushy stuff, the humour in this film was perfect, there was never a cringy joke moment unless it was intended that way, and they never put a joke in a bad place. I was slightly worried the album may overshadow the movie, but it was perfect, never took anything away from the movie. Ryan Gosling did a fantastic job because I really believed he was Ken, nothing in me could say ""yeah that's Ryan"". Margot did a superb performance of Barbie, it is hard to play a doll that is perfect yet is experiencing an existential crisis of emotion, she deserves more praise."
"Greta Gerwig did it. Broke the ceiling financially for a movie directed by a woman.I like all of her work and the Barbie theme was a daring one to take on. Then again she created a powerful version of Little Women. I also figured if Isa Rae agreed to be in this, there had to be more to it.It was so much funnier than expected. They figured out how to not make a parody of Barbie and Ken. That's no small task.I don't want to give away anything because everyone is going to see themselves in this in another way. It's clever, thoughtful, and so funny. The actors performed to perfection.There's a lot to unpack in this movie. I want to watch it again. It has all the makings of a classic and a cult film."
"I went in there with O expectations, but boy, it was cunning and audacious to say the least! It is one the most original movie made in terms of writing, filming, cinematography, in recent times to be made with a fake subject but very relevant plot!Barbie speaks to alot of women and
MEN about feminism, patriarchy, consumerism and existentialism in its own weird, sometimes cringe but mostly funny way.Full Marks for Casting. Top to toe perfect casting for Barbie and Ken. But movié is boring in the beginning and too preachy otherwise.Totally skippable in the theatres. Its not worth the hype tbh."
"Greta Gerwig's Barbie is perhaps one of the most ambitious film in recent history. The fact that a filmmaker decides to make a film on such an idea which is equally popular and problematic is brave.It is both a celebration as well as a quip on the Barbie world. Barbie deals with the modern day gender issues and how Barbie (the company) stands as a symbol of all those issues. At the same time it cleverly portrays the emotions involved of all those who love and admire this pop symbol.Margot Robbie is excellent as Barbie. Her performance range is phenomenal. Gerwig uses her aptly. Gosling is cute and is being judiciously used for his charm and handsome vulnerability that he brings. All the supporting casts (most of them are from just one show hence the title of this review) have done their job well. Can't say I am particularly impressed by any one though as there isn't much for them to do. Although Will Ferrel and America Ferrera are an exception as they shines
in their limited appearance and steal the show.The music, production design and direction along with Baumbach's writing is outrageously entertaining and often funny as well. The bizarre world of Barbie will be loved not just by the ones who carry a nostalgic baggage of playing with one in their childhood but also to those who have never ever heard about it. Such is the charm of this movie."
"The latest installment in the Barbie movie franchise takes an unexpected turn, veering away from the child-friendly themes that fans have come to expect. In this new adventure, Barbie finds herself navigating the complexities of the real world, facing a stark realisation that men rule the world - much to Ken's delight.While this plotline may spark debate and offer an occasion for intellectual discourse, it's crucial to remember the intended audience of such movies. Given its 12A certificate, this film should not be regarded as a children's movie. Parents expecting lighthearted entertainment may be caught off-guard when sitting down with their young ones.For those who are able to appreciate its more mature themes and humour, moments of levity can be found. However, with a slow beginning that only picks up halfway through, some viewers may struggle to maintain interest. Furthermore, the film's rushed conclusion leaves much to be desired and falls short in satisfying fans' craving for a cohesive storyline.Potential audience members should weigh whether the departure from traditional child-oriented content is worth viewing or not.In summary, while this unique approach to a Barbie movie has its merits, it should be approached with caution by parents of younger children due to its mature themes and occasional tedium."
"Barbie is definitely one of the best films to bought out to cinemas this year, or even longer than that. It had us laughing from the start to finish, crying in some moments and scenes so overall it was an emotional rollercoaster. Greta has done a great job and balanced a mix of fun and hard truths about the world we live in today. For people say this isn't worth watching, clearly don't know how to let a film just transport you away into its world for a moment, absolutely brilliant film, I'd pay to go and watch it again. Well done to Greta, Margot, Ryan and all of the cast & crew for a fantastic watch!"
"I'm only saying it could have been better because of the hype. I was expecting a little more and was a little disappointed by some aspects of the film. Firstly I'll say that Margot as Barbie and Ryan as Ken were great individually. A large part of why this movie was so good is because of what they brought to the characters and the story on screen. I found watching Ken discovering ""patriarchy"" to be the most hilarious part of the film. However, one of the first critiques I have is that it felt like the movie didn't spend enough time in Barbieland. The serious shift felt a little too sudden when it could have benefitted from fleshing out the ""perfect"" life a little more and the character dynamics of the barbies and Kens. This also would have made me personally feel more like I care as a viewer regarding the emotions and thoughts that Barbie and Ken were experiencing when they went to the real world. Secondly, it's use of heavily weighted political words being used loosely by the barbies and kens water down the overall issue this film is trying to be about. I think being a woman in the real world is a lot more complicated than going on a beach and getting harassed. Or seeing a bunch of men working and socialising in corporate. I understand the way the movie addresses this is meant to be with a comical and somewhat obvious tone, and it was. However, it could have benefitted from also adding a bit more of a layered experience to these issues which would consequently add more dimensions to when these politically weighted words were used. It just felt, in my personal opinion, to be thrown around for the convenience of making a point amongst all the silliness but with no real material message. Finally, which brings me to my third critique, is that the movie didn't seem to be for kids but at the same time it was? My first argument for why perhaps the two critiques I have made might not be valid is because it's a kids film, and in that sense it would, well, make sense. But then there was the use of heavy political language used throughout the movie that just wouldn't be useful for a storyline in which kids can get the message, not to mention literal sexual reference made to female and male gentilia which seemed inappropriate for children. Don't get me wrong, I love when kids movies throw in a little something subtle for adults to obviously get a giggle at, which I argue Shrek did very well for example. However, the script of this movie (I'm not speaking of visuals for obvious reasons) just seemed a little confused in which age group it was catering too. Which arguably limited itself in diving deeper into the above two points I made.Nevertheless, it was an enjoyable film and good in its own merits. Ken as a character made a lot of sense given his whole purpose as a doll in real life. And that essence I think they captured well. 7/10."
"So, I didn't have that much of a high expectation going in to see this because I really wasn't sure what is was going to be. I grew up playing Barbie's and have watched the animated films many times with my kids.The movie from start to finish is so thoughtfully executed. It's for everyone, but mainly young girls need to see this. It's a great reminder of how special we are as women and how special ALL of us are individually as a person and the life we get to experience.Another fantastic element is adding a very 90s feel to the film. You will laugh like you used to laugh when fun comedies would come out in theatre's years ago. I haven't seen just a good comedy with heart in years.I brought my 7yr old and we dressed up for it too. I wanted her to see me comfortable in my own skin and her as well and the film touches on that. It's suited for any age, regardless of the rating.I don't give high ratings like this to films usually, as I find small things usually that I wish had been addressed more... but not in Barbie. What a fun movie and a great time you'll have watching this in theatre (or at home) knowing it's your childhood come to life."
"I took my twin daughters to go see this film at the movie theaters with me this weekend. They are 11 and they seemed to enjoy it. The film is geared much to a older crowd, which helped keep them entertained as well as the adults that were in the theater as well. Margot Robbie was great as Barbie she did very good in that role. I love how the film put a modern twist on how people are these days in society- dealing with social anxiety and other disorders. Yet it tells the story of why Barbie was initially invented to began with and what Barbie and Ken stood for. This is a good film to watch with your teenage daughters."
"The movie starts great, but goes off the rails soon after. Had they kept the look and feel of the first 30 minutes, this movie could've been great.For positives, the cast is great in general. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling do a great job as ""Stereotypical Barbie"" and Ken. Barbieland also looks vividly colorful and full of references to the toys themselves anyone who played with Barbie toys will recognize.For negatives, It is not a fun movie at its core. The movie pits women against men and it has a negative and political messaging. It's a ""lecturing feminist"" and ""bring down the patriarchy"" kind of movie. I wasn't expecting it to turn out this way from the trailers and was honestly surprised by it.In general, if you're looking for a lighthearted movie about Barbies (and Kens) where you can kick back, relax and have some laughs, this movie is not it."
"This movie is AWESOME! Unexpected in so many good ways. Addresses so many social issues and complicated conversations in a fun, fair, and thoughtful way. What a joyful blend of comedy, music, color and memories from childhood. Every frame is filled with so much visual candy, and if you ever owned a Barbie or Ken or skipper or Alan you will not be disappointed by the costumes or sets. The actors, editing, directing, writing and set design are a solid 10. I don't think the previews do this movie justice, it was so much more than I expected. Mattel managed to pull this kaleidoscope of a movie off; kudos to the believers of this script. It is so worth seeing once, twice, three times and then some!"
"""Barbie"" should be the only movie I can give 10/10 this year. Both the rhythm of the plot, the tribute to the toy are perfect. Also, from feminism and women's own awakening to the awakening of self is the perfect theme. The plot in the middle of the movie is also very funny and the musical cooperation makes the whole comedy level of the movie to a higher level. By the way, the clothes, buildings, stage properties is a great tribute to toys. In the video, you can see the different Barbies is or was sold in the market, and each Barbie is very distinctive and easy to identify. Let's hope Mattel releases more and better Barbie in the coming years. I really hope you guys could come to cinema and see this movie."
"Scoreboard:Overall Score: 6.7/10Storyline/Plot: 6.8/10Acting: 8/10Directing: 7/10Ending: 7/10Cinematography: 6.5/10Comedy: 6.8/10Action: 5.9/10Overall Review:Firstly, in all my years of being a Cinema Connoisseur, it is rare to see a movie sell out as quickly and widespread as Barbie. So well done to the Barbie marketing team!I walked in the cinema with no expectations, but I have to say I was overall pleasantly surprised with Barbie. I thought it might be the usual run of the mill silly kids movie, with a completely unserious/unrealistic storyline.However, the Barbie storyline touched on a lot of serious real world issues and situations that many people can relate to. With that said, it did feel like a senseless musical at times, with unesscessary sing/dance scenes.The essence of the film touches on the juxtaposition of what life would be like if women ruled the world (Barbie Land). And the real world we live in, which is male dominated. This was portrayed well, but did get abit too silly sometimes.The level of acting from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, were both bang on. Considering they were playing dolls, they kept a great balance between having to act silly, whilst still keeping a level of seriousness, so the sillyness doesn't go overboard.Overall, ""Barbie"" was actually a decent watch with a good level of comedy and realism, whilst keeping the essence of what Barbie represents.Isit worth a watch?... Whether you are a woman or man, young or old. Barbie has a little bit for everyone to relate to. So for that reason it is worth a watch, but don't go in with high hopes unless you are a die hard Barbie fan!"
"If you're making brand films, each of his directors reveals his own vision, and that vision generally lacks some points. However, I think Greta Gerwig knew all aspects of Barbie so well that she reflected it on the screen perfectly. Margot Robbie also played the part very well apart from a few small scenes. In fact, when Barbie is mentioned, the role is well-accepted. Of course, Barbie is not the only character fully reflected in the movie. By writing Ken as a one-dimensional character and inserting a prominent role in the story, he significantly increased the directors of the movie games. Ryan Gosling had a great acting. Frankly, he manages to steal the heart of television in every scene on the screen. For the other Barbie and Ken players, the states didn't show much of a performance (Maybe Kate McKinnon). There were no such important scenes anyway. But America Ferrera didn't do a great job despite having a very available house. I wouldn't say that I played badly, but there are a lot of actors who give better use of that role in my opinion."
"The real power of cinema came to the forefront as two films went head to head against one another this Friday. One was based on a childhood icon that attained the status of a cultural phenomenon over the years as evident from the massive craze around it and the other was based on an icon in the realm of science whose invention changed the course of the world and was directed by a man who has emerged as a phenomena himself in the world of cinema. The former celebrates girl power and inclusivity while the latter is largely a man's world built on a critique of warfare and corrupt politics. To address the elephant in the room, ""Oppenheimer"" beats ""Barbie"" on all fronts without having to put up much of a fight, irrespective of what the box office figures might denote.That said, ""Barbie"" is a good film, a fun watch, that could have been so much more. The first half was a joyride providing all the fun that the film must have intended to provide during the course of its runtime. It was a job well done by the art directors and set designers as they enabled in creating a vibrant, colourful world without any trace of morbidity. The Barbie houses, the beach, the house of the Weird Barbie, the roads, the Netherlands-like fields, the sea - they were created with a perfection that one can only dream of, only to let you sink and immerse yourselves in the colours that Gerwig's vision could have borrowed straight of the rainbow. To conceptualize and execute such a world is an extraordinary accomplishment with the sets perfectly complementing the colourful lives of our Barbies. The Barbies come from all walks of life, hold important positions, and stay at the frontline of Barbie life - a contrast to the human world where a bigshot at a top private firm claims to Ken that they don the mask of inclusivity so that they do not have to deal with a backlash. At the center of all these Barbies is Margot Robbie's Stereotypical Barbie who is ever joyful and unfettered by emotions like grief or anxiety. She is the paragon of the beauty as it was once envisioned, hence the stereotype about her. The Kens have nothing much to do in this world other than bicker over their vulnerabilities. All was well until the real world began messing with the Barbie world and our protagonist is hit by concerning thoughts like death. Depression takes root in her mind and she has to embark on a journey to the real world to not only fix her own life but also that of her owner. ""Barbie"" should have stopped here or should have taken an alternate route to the denouement as the second half just steers out of control and every theme seemed to being heavily hammered into youe mind as if the script had lost confidence in the viewer to effortlessly let those ideas in. The last 30 minutes felt stretched out of control except for the incredibly done Ken song - one of my favourite moments from the film. Gerwig had let the viewers have most of the fun in the first hour but the script lost the steam as it trudged to the finish line. Gerwig is worthy appreciation for her vision, for the world she has accomplished in this film, for the infinite ideas she has established - feminism to motherhood to inclusivity to bending all gender stereotypes. She has been sensitive and empathetic in her handling of depression. If only she had not taken the approach of a moral parable in the second half this film could have been so much better.""Barbie"" packs in a stellar cast with every single one of them investing the best of their qualities in the project. Robbie looks absolutely pretty as she should have in this role and handles joy, sadness, existential crisis with the capability that she as an actor has always possessed. Issa Rae as President Barbie and Kate McKinnon as Weird Barbie are two other standouts. But the real star of the show is Ryan Gosling - his Ken-ergy is infectious and will keep you in splits throughout. Just look at his incredible comedic chops when Ken visits the human world. You just can't have Ken-ough of Gosling's Ken. ""La La Land"" showed that he could dance really well, a skill he has put effectively to use in the Ken song too.In the end, Gerwig's film is a pretty looking tribute to a pretty cultural phenomena. It could have had a little more of the ""muchness"" (as the Mad Hatter would say in ""Alice in Wonderland"") in the fun department. It dazzles throughout but the baggage of its heavy-handedness drags it down to an extent. Alas!"
"I have never felt move validated as a woman as when I watched this film. It is so beautiful and meaningful while also being witty and funny, this is what a movie is supposed to be. You are supposed to be on the verge of tears and the next minute laughing, it's an experience. Although men will watch this and enjoy it, they won't understand it or how validating it is as a woman to watch. This movie was something I hope every little girl will watch and every woman will watch so she can feel validated. This movie is so meaningful and I hope people will see behind the glitz and glamour and see the sentiment behind it. I'm so happy this movie has been created and I've never watched a film that so beautifully shows how complex it is to be a woman and how the patriarchy damages everyone in it but mostly women. It was deeper that barbie and pink and silly. It's also interesting how the dialogue is from a child's perspective of playing with a doll. It took me back to being little and playing with my dolls and thinking anything was possible and not feeling guilty about liking girly stuff, or wearing pink. So well done and definitely a conversation starter. I hope when mothers accidentally take their daughters to see this expecting something else they come out feeling good about being a woman."
"Me and my sister both enjoyed this film and disliked it. The beginning of the film starts off with little girls destroying baby dolls because the new ""barbie toy"" had been created. Me and my sister were shocked and also disappointed in the scene. The movie was really funny, it had us laughing a lot and we enjoyed it. They made men look absolutely stupid, as in if there was just one leadership position filled by a man it was the end of the world. That part annoyed us and we strongly disagreed w it. Overall, i think that the movie could have been better, but it wasn't the worst i've ever seen. I definitely enjoyed certain moments of watching the film, but definitely not every moment. I recommend this film for the barbie world experience. I think every actor/actress fulfilled the role they played. However i don't think that the story was 100% in line and think it could have been a bit better. :)"
"I have successfully completed Barbenheimer and what a wonderful weekend for cinema it was. Every so often is their polar opposite releases but none ever this big. I saw packed theatres consistently on both days which was an amazing thing to be apart of. It felt very much like the old days of going to the theatres for any movie and the auditorium being absolutely packed!Barbie follows stereotypical Barbie as her normal perfect life gets disturbed by something happening in the real world as to which she has to leave Barbie world and fix her life.This is the bare bones of the story but Greta Gerwig explores so much more than that. It's obvious the film is highly inspired by films such as Wizard of Oz, La La Land and 2001 space odyssey to name a few. The talent behind the camera is very obvious and this is extremely stylized film. All of the Barbie stuff is top notch and the sets they built feels like something Tim Burton cooked up. Really excellent set design, costumes and props throughout this film.I was really worried that this film would spend too much time in the real world and it doesn't. It focuses alot of its story in Barbie World which I really appreciated. Margot Robbie is perfect in the role and continues to showcase her acting chops. Ryan Gosling is amazing too he has the perfect comedic timing and delivery. Perfect casting combo for this role.Barbie is a much deeper character exploration and interesting topic point that is very aesthetically shown in this film. No matter what you believe in there is an honest message and I'm sure many girls of all ages will relate to this film on one level or another."
"Barbie is a curious film, and I believe that the high expectations of the general public led to its performance being considered average. The film tries to criticize several things at the same time , criticizing how society puts pressure on women and reflections on self-knowledge, besides that, I assume that at some point someone wanted to criticize large corporations, but all of this gets lost in development and becomes confusing and often it's not clear what the movie really wants to be about, maybe focusing on just one thing or working them all properly would be better. Anyway, the film is fun and manages to get some very loud laughs, and unfortunately this script problem persists in situations that just happen without any development or reason, I hope that in a future sequel this is better worked on."
"I expected this movie to be more lighthearted and it had heavy themes and material. The first half hour or so was ok and had some funny moments but the second half just wasn't enjoyable to me. The writing was not good story telling and felt more like a number of speeches. I found it hard to watch honestly.There was a lot of overt messaging that I feel was not suitable for this movie. I didn't appreciate the depiction of the relationship between Ken and Barbie or the situation created for them. The acting, some musical numbers and sets were good but overall a missed opportunity to make a fun feel-good movie. I was very disappointed."
This movie has such a powerful message for women everywhere! The set is amazing and the movie is so funny. The writing is so clever and funny! It made me feel so powerful and validated! I really enjoyed it! Margot Robbie is the perfect Barbie! And Ryan Gosling is the perfect Ken! I feel like the chemistry between them and all of the other Barbies and Kens were great! I loved how there were different type of Barbies in the movie! Being a woman is amazing and powerful and I hate how the world doesn't respect us or take us seriously. There was some slow parts and jokes that didn't land for me but overall it was a great film!
"Barbie is a fantastic movie, it's so layered, bold and smart. Brilliant writing, directing, acting, costumes and set design wow. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are amazing in it. Also America Ferrera, what a performance (her monologue in one scene has us gagged in the cinema).Greta Gerwig created a clever, charming and fun movie that will have you laugh, smile and clap. It will also have you thinking about our individual role and place in the world. A breath of fresh air in the world of cinema and one that is needed for these challenging times we're in.Margot Robbie as Barbie was like she was born to play the role. But still, imo Ken(played by literally me) stole the show.A solid 8."
"I was excited to see this movie after hearing how much people liked it. I anticipated it having strong messages and it did, but it was a little all over the place. I'm not sure there actually was a cohesive message, but I found myself very emotional at moments during this film. I think it speaks to both men and women who feel societal pressures to be certain things and act certain ways. The music is amazing, and the Ken dance sequence might have been my favorite thing I have seen at the movies this year. This movie is also hilarious throughout. I left not knowing exactly how I was meant to feel, but I did enjoy all the pieces even if they didn't come together completely.Does NOT need a sequel or a Mattel cinematic universe! Lol."
"My expectations were very low for the movie but I am surprised. The Movie was literally good, the cast were fantastic, the set up delivered the fabulousness of the B world! Margot Robbie is a great choice for Barbie. I hope to see some elements from lgbti+ but it did not bothered me at all. Planning to go and see again.Ryan Gosling, he literally delivered his best. The soundtrack should have some more elements from 80s 90s as the storyline mostly based on these years of Barbie.Paying a tribute to Ruth was amazing but they should have also pay a tribute to the original Barbie, Bild Lilli..."
"Barbie movie was alright. Some scenes were quite cringe and the movie was not that super funny after all. Jokes here and there were sexually but that was it. Nowadays, I believe it is a good thing that the characters in the movie are all people from color. What is still a mystery and confusing is how they left the Barbieworld to the real world and vice versa... Besides the storyline was sometimes random and out of the blue how things turned out. I wouldn't definitely watch this movie again. Though, I would watch it as a drinking game, whenever someone says Barbie you have to take a shot. Cuz damn that word is being said sooo many times!"
"Barbie changed me for the better. It made me appreciate being a woman all over again, it made me appreciate my mother more and it made me more grateful to have 3 little girls. It'll make Barbie playtime more special and fun. It'll be a staple in my home and something that grows with me and my girls. It was funny, emotional, energetic and wholesome. Every time Barbie cried, I cried. Every time she laughed , I laughed. Growing up Barbie was my go to toy , it brought me comfort and fun. And as I had my girls it brings me joy to stand in the Barbie aisle as they pick out their favorite Barbie. Thank you so much for this movie. 💕"
"The film is straightforward and innovative. Straightness, because it does not conceal, highly academic and personal emotional views of the dialogue and monologue, as well as impact, highly purposeful close-up of the social landscape. It is innovative because under its careless surface, the film depicts the plight and awakening of men and women in this world under traditional values. Different from the Chinese film ""Better Man"", it shows an understanding of the different psychological characteristics of men and women, and is more compassionate and emotional. The ""Better man"" is only limited to the surface of social issues, but this movie also expressed their in-depth views and vision. That resonates with the general public, not just women.First, the film is always straightforward, second, the artistic conception is complex and the brushstrokes are shallow, which really contradicts my values. Therefore, I did not have any clear ideas and profound emotional experience when I just watched it, and even after returning home, I could not make a complete analysis, so I can only start from the overall situation when writing film reviews, which may be regarded as the objective shortcomings of the film. Although ""Barbie"" is not what I expected to use the story to speak for itself, in hindsight it is a pretty good piece of work. (Better than the better man next door anyway)"
"Barbie is, in its very core, a comedy, and a funny one at that. From the opening scene, Greta Gerwig set up the mood that will run thru the entire movie. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are both amazing, but the rest of the big ensemble is a mixed bag. This is mostly because of the writing. Will Ferrells character served no more purpose than advertise the Mattel company as goofy and ""self aware"". The third act slows the movie down, which is a shame as the first and second acts are very strong. However, when Barbie delivers it delivers. The set design are beautifully artificial. Barbie sometimes shows strokes of genius, but fails to deliver a strong end."
"I enjoyed this movie a lot, but there were also some parts in the storyline that didn't make sense or lacked depth.First off the things I enjoyed:
The decor and colors were amazing, the music was great, the casting was incredible, weird barbie, Allan, the way barbie and Ken were completely unaware of how the world worked when they first got there, kens song, the fragments of life that barbie saw at the end.Even though many parts were good, there are parts that just lacked sense.The movie tries to make sort of a statement of mother daughter relationships, which kind of works but just not quite. The daughter character doesn't contribute much to the story, she's really just that one grumpy teenage character who turns out to have a heart after all, but it just didn't make sense in the story. Next the entire corporation storyline didn't make sense at all. In the beginning it was like fine, they try to get barbie back to barbieland, but then she goes back herself, they follow her and from that point they contribute literally nothing to the story anymore. I forgot they were there until they suddenly appeared out of the bushes. It just lacked depth and logic and in my opinion it just wasn't necessary to have made the movie to what it was.Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie a lot, but some plot points just weren't what I expected them to be. Still, I would recommend this movie to a friend."
"I really don't know what to say about this movie . Everything was colorful, the humor was there , the satire and everybody did great at what they were suppose to do . I went in there with low expectations because it's a Barbie film but I was surprised how adult the humor was and the message it got across was pretty touching . Margot Robbie as Barbie was perfect casting and the theatre was filled , everybody had a good time . I should give this score maybe a bit higher but I just felt it was just a bunch of things mashed together I was watching a parody episode of South Park which is not a bad thing , I though it was the right direction for a movie called Barbie . It was weird to me but in a very good way and LOL at the ending , made everybody laugh . Check it out , I say it's worth a view in the theatre."
"I think the extensive hype and the long standing popularity of the Barbie brand are responsible for bringing several generations of fans into the theaters resulting in the opening sales. It certainly isn't the movie, itself. The storyline was overly simplistic, poorly written and I didn't find its style of absurd humor to be funny. The movie relied a lot on sight gags that I thought fell flat. The ending seemed to come out of the blue and was a poor attempt at profundity. Margot Robbie IS the consummate Barbie, but she pretty much plays ""actress Barbie"" in everything she does, so it wasn't anything groundbreaking for her. I thought Gloria and Sasha were the best characters and the combination of their performances along with the costumes and sets are the reason I gave the movie any stars at all. The concept of patriarchy certainly isn't anything new and IMO there are much better films on the subject - starting with any of the Jane Austin films and this director's other film - Little Women."
I was all in for this movie before I saw it. As time went by I got concerned my expectations were impossibly high and I'd inevitably be disappointed. Saw it opening night in a packed cinema all dressed in pink (yes the men too). I laughed far more than I expected and had a damn good cry. My ridiculous expectations were exceeded.Barbie is funnier and more touching than I was expecting. It's just the right kind of meta and deals with gender roles and our complicated feelings about Barbie and what she represents in a balanced and realistic way. I'm not sure how I left a film after staring at Margo Robbie and the rest and felt better about myself than before I went in. See it in the cinema if you can. Going from a loudly giggling crowd to suddenly being able to hear a pin drop when the film hit some hard truths was wonderful. Fill two hours of your time with joy and Kenergy! We are all Kenough.
I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed this. At the very beginning I thought it would be a pointless film of how perfect you should look and how you should act a certain way in order for society to like you.How wrong I was!I thought the script was hilarious but also inspirational. One moment I was laughing then the next tearing up.The actors done such an amazing job!Ryan Gosling as Ken was such a good choice he played it brilliantly.My Daughter loved it and came away with the right message that you shouldn't have to fit in to any type of box that you should just be you as that's enough!
"So bad it's good! What a political/philosophical/artistic/stylistic/linguistic/directoral/musical mess! Who is this film even for? I'm guessing teenage airheads - the sort that happily equate a Barbie doll with the Nazi war machine, as is done in the film. Wow! If the aim was feminism, I'd call this an own goal. So whinging, so reliant on gender stereotypes and societal stereotypes, so busy sermonising, it achieves nothing. The reasoning behind the film's reasoning wouldn't stand up to two minutes of scrutiny. Who wrote this junk? Who directed it? Who signed it off? Honestly, I'm not kidding when I say it's so bad it's good; I'd happily rewatch it just to marvel again at the grinding cognitive dissonance. I'm looking forward to the IMDB rating dropping - already below 7.5."
"First half was very enjoyable, but the rest felt rushed and with no direction. Like it didn't really know what to focus on.I loved the music and choreography, the scenography was amazing and I genuinely laughed a couple times.Ken bringing patriarchy to Barbieland and screwing things up is a fun and interesting concept. Although, I feel like the plot turned simplistic and took the easy way out. I don't buy the ""Nah, everything was perfect before, let's get things exactly as they were"".The dialogues sometimes want to be this emotional speeches that kinda take me out, it doesn't feel like a natural progression. As it is often said, it was too much ""tell"" and too little ""show""."
My mom aunts and my sister and my cousin Emily and Maddie grew up with Barbie and Ken for almost their entire childhood to adulthood. After seeing the Barbie movie it made me laugh and see what it's like to grow up with a doll that my sis played with all the time when I was a toddler . I remember my sis having a giant Barbie toy when she was about 4 and she played with her all the time and dressed her with her clothes . But now that Barbie reached theaters my sis and mom realized Barbie is more then just a toy she's the fashion model to all Barbie's from the 60s 70s 80s 90 2000s to now .Barbie welcome.
"As of today's date, I would say this is the film produced by Luckychap Entertainment that I've liked the least, despite a more than promising trailer. Despite a perfect cast (Margot Robbie & Ryan Gosling seem to be born to play these roles, and the adorable America Ferrera & Emma Mackey are always a delight to have on screen) + sets & atmosphere that exceeded my expectations, I wasn't convinced by the storytelling at the end. The first half of the film is great, but things get complicated when Barbie & Ken leave Barbieland, and here we fall into the trap of a war of the sexes, when I think it would have been more appropriate to try and raise awareness of the fact that ""domination"" never serves anyone. In short, the film is worth seeing, but I have to admit that given my expectations of it, I'm a little disappointed, even if the costumes/settings/acting are stunning."
"This movie was definitely made for everybody. It had hilarious scenes and a few sad ones. And I was always told when a movie makes you laugh and cry, it's a great movie. The plot and message was unexpected, in a good way though. I could also tell that it touched people. In the theatre, I heard "" oh my god,"", sniffles, and gasps. The cast and acting was off the top and the detail was, too. Although, you may here some comments saying, "" Oh this movie is sexist against men,"". You really have to see the movie to understand it. The people that are saying those things, obviously have not seen the movie. It's just so good, I would be able to watch this everyday. It is definitely worth the money to see it."
"""I want to do the imagining. I don't want to be the idea."".When my kid informed me he and his friends were going to see a Barbie movie, I couldn't believe it. The stereotypical mother in me instantly responded. Seeing as how MI and IJ were running in parallel in theatres, I was taken aback and asked him why a group of boys would be interested in seeing Barbie. Will there be any girls there? I'm guessing I probably sounded kind of dorky in his ears. His response, though, was typical of his generation:This is a spoof and not a movie aimed at just girls, Mom. But, like any mother, I made arrangements to watch the movie myself before he did. Also, the other reason was that as a kid, I had eight dolls, and the majority of my time went into playing with them and building stories. And only Barbie was one of those dolls whose identity was recognised consistently over the globe. Barbie therefore represents the shared imagination of all kids who play with it across the world.It was the right decision to see this film because otherwise I would not have realised what a brilliant move it was for the brand to reach out to younger consumers. Barbie is a great gimmick for a rebranding campaign to appeal to Generation Z, which places an emphasis on pragmatics.We all know that Barbie has a checkered history. Barbie's version as a math-averse doll was not received well. Barbie, packaged with a ""don't eat"" diet handbook, protested. Someone who seems black on the exterior but is really white on the inside was being mocked by Oreao's crazy cookie Barbie. The creepiest thing was pregnant Barbie with babies in her belly, and the oddest thing was when Barbie went through puberty. Hijab Barbie and Virus Barbie both sparked new debates. Parents were largely concerned about the FBI tip of a security threat regarding the Video Girl Barbie.Most criticised among Gen Z was Barbie's excessively slender body, which has been an undesirable role model for women. It precisely articulates the enormous problem of existential crises that the outside world has manufactured and which individuals have mindlessly embraced.To begin with, the film explored the same themes, including the existential difficulties brought on by the persistence of patriarchy and Barbie stereotypes. The story starts with Barbie living a happy life in Barbieland, but she notices that she is developing human consciousness. To find answers, she has to travel to the real world in order to restore normality. As she and Ken enter the real world, Barbie is overwhelmed to see the many ways in which women are treated as objects and devalued. Multiple sets of eyes scrutinise all of their actions. Both Barbie and Ken's masculine awakenings also go through existential crises. Later in the movie, with Ken's changed behaviour after going to the real world, Barbie's attempt to appease Ken's manly ego by playing a weakling is satire. However, the much-touted ""gender war"" is seen humorously despite the fact that it still exists, whether people accept it or not.Now, coming to the technical part of the film, the Barbie-land segment was overdone. The transition from Barbie Land to the actual world was also too long; a crisp cut here, as in Jumanji, would have made more sense. So the movie has a sluggish start, but it picks up speed and becomes engaging as time goes on. The humour was really cliched and cheap, so that wasn't great.Both Margot's and Ryan's performances were excellent. While the actors were all spot-on, the film's direction let it down by not keeping the action moving at a good clip and by delivering a confusing muddle of a plot and a message that left viewers with no clear conclusions. A more succinct conclusion would have been fantastic. Though I did like the part at the end where, at the workplace, Barbie prefers Flat Sandals over heels, I was relating all this to my pageant life, where wearing a minimum of 3.5 inches of heels was mandatory before stepping out of your room in public. In the movie, Barbie leaves the fake world behind.To end with my favourite line by Barbie's creator, Ruth Handler, played by Rhea Perlman: ""Humans have only one ending. Ideas live for ever.""
The movie is a good introduction to the world of dolls for those who haven't seen anything like it before. It is a case study in itself, showing how the power of sentiment is a driving force in the doll industry. After a year of record sales during the epidemic, last year saw a dip, so it's easy to see why Mattel is counting on the new Barbie film to reverse the trend by syncing up with generation Z's pragmatic thinking."
"This is the best movie I've seen in last 5 years. It's fun from beginning till the end. It is just what you would expect from a barbie movie, but it's also so much more. The plot is excellent, there is a lot of cool cameos and there is a new surprise in every second of the movie. It's unpredictable, so funny and it's also kind of deep. Would recommend 10/10."
"Honestly this is the weirdest movie I have ever seen. It is definitely a good movie but I'm not sure what to make of it. The message was so convoluted that you didn't know what it was trying to say.WARNING: The movie is not like ""Enchanted"" where it's a fun romantic comedy. The movie is funny, but it is convoluted with allegory.Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie both are fantastic. American Ferrera also shines. Will Ferrell was meh.My biggest thing was wondering why they chose to make Mattel cartoon feeling while at the same time trying to portray the real world. You're going to come out of this movie either hating it, loving it, or like me wondering what the hell you just watched."
"Watched the movie last week as family since daughter wanted to see it. The marketing engine has been working overtime as there is a lot of hype generated by placing Barbie topic everywhere. The actors did great job in the role and script they have been given, but the movie falls short on delivering experience. The storyline is mediocre at best with gaps in places and the ending is confusing as if the writer hit a brick wall.Mattel is only eyeing profits from movie and metch sales and paying zero attention to actually creating good movie. Comparing this to LEGO which was far better all round."
"Briefing: 25 , Male , watched alone . Not in any relationship.Yo
Greta grewig, you joyous beauty! You are an absolute gem . I ll try watching your movies ( directed/acted ) . All the cast members, visuals, musicals , themes , costume design, choreography aside , let me just write about the story . The actual plot which progresses.There are some fairly thought subjective criticism too but they are minimum, completely avoidable.Here we see a doll living her best life . The opening invites you like a Disney animated movie when Disney was at their peak ! Like late 2010 or 11 ; The way Men toys are shown is literally cringe worthy (*cries.. cuz that's desperate)
but isn't it the whole point ?! Every thing happens real smooth cha cha , then one day our Lady falls in her existential draid...This existential draid has been a recurring theme in many classics. From Taxi Driver to Sopranos ( two heavily Male centric fictional stories ) & in many Arthouse directors life long theme ; from Andrei Tarkovsky to Ingmar Bergmann.I was literally awestruck to find such a theme in this movie..
..
But,
Everything afterwards is completely different than how typical existential draidy movies handles its story progression.Barbie decides to go to real world with Ken . A Ken which literally has no purpose in his life discovers adventure, PATRIARCHAL SOCIETY & gets deviated from his actual purpose. Here the humour elements are so heart touching that you ll feel your childhood fantasy in real life . From a Male POV , This is nothing less than seeing Transformers/Terminator /Avengers/ G I. Joe for the first time in live action . See its definitely understandable how girls are going to perceive this .But make it even more enjoyable cause the humour element are so true! ( Both Barbie & ken getting sacked by cops! )The horror
The certain realisation hits Barbie when she witnesses how or where the world is heading towards, How ken discovers Patrichy and leaves Barbie in the real world to invent kendom in Barbieland!Everything at this point goes downhill until she meets a woman who make her see the way . Not the Granny , no ..
The mother who is still a child within her Heart .America FerreraApparently more than Barbie, Miss Ferrera 's character is made like an Angel. She helps Barbie by solving every little bit of her issues , healthy advices & that with a great masterplan. So simple yet so Damn effective! Go watch it , m not writing every detail!The transformation :
We see Barbie showing a lot of emotions while staying true to her emotions. She experiences Anger , sadness, stubbornness, yet she stays kind . She listens to her Human domain , believes in her actions, doubtful but always stays optimistic.& I THINK THIS WORLD HASN'T GOT WOMEN LIKE THIS ANYMORE.Women nowdays are getting Cold , distant & are accepting Masculine traits desperatly to fight male egos thus destroying their Charisma, personality & Charm . See at the end , the journey comes to an end when a doll becomes human . That transformation, comes through 1) confusion , 2) anger issues (when ken forces himself to join barbie while accessing the human world) , 3) denial (barbie getting into mettel corp.) , 4 ) pain (Barbie meeting that human girl who calls her a capitalist/fascist , 5) agreement (planning to take over barbieland) & 6) still having complete understanding & empathy towards Ken . Saving ken when he breaks down & accepts KENS' defeat . Not even once , not even for once Barbie shows any type of Pride / jealousy / resentment.That makes her even more than a human.The ending , thats why feels perfect!She getting transformed into a human through such an interesting journey feels poignant. Not forced , not sketchy , not masculine but entirely simple , vivid & full of feminine traits.Sexism works both ways . (First Barbie getting annoyed over Ken's desperation & later Ken taking over the Barbieland) This movie just shows if both Men & Women listen to eachother & work for their inner souls they can let go of their respective personal bad blood & stupid patriarchal things which has been a stigmata of this giant world. Gone are the days when Women only used to do household works & Nursery cause there is no World War Anymore
So now its time to completely bury that stupid mentality.Ken realises it later like all men do
& I think Greta could have given him a better ending than making him wear a shirt which says "" i am kenough "" hilarious yet a bit lacky. -1 for that .And yes those childlike Bollywood songs , -1 for that.Still a clear W .This just shows if a doll can make right choices & becomes a human
A human female, if she chooses the right paths can become much more than just a woman. Lovely film . Great experience!Certified Kino stuff."
"If Barbie could've done anything with this movie, this is the best it could've done. Pulled off with comedy, heart, and emotion, Barbie delivers.Cast is great. No questions asked. I loved some of the smaller cameos in this film, definitely made the movie more appealing.Humor is back and forth in this movie, and all the jokes will keep you chuckling. I had some people laughing louder than the movie itself to some of these jokes. Props to you, Gerwig.Emotion is heavily involved in the third act of the film, and definitely changes tone. The ending takes sort of a twist, but is a good way to end the film.Overall, the film is great. Highly recommend seeing. Some of the jokes are more adult, so maybe think twice before taking your kid to see this. If you don't have kids, go see this. It'll be worth your money."
"Was I expecting more from Greta gerwig? Yes!Form the trailers, i never got a solid idea what Barbie the film was: a musical, a comedy, a coming of age story, a metaphor for something greater ? Maybe Barbie tries all of the above to a shallow extend. There are deep ideas introduced that immediately caught my attention. Several in fact, scattered strategically at the beginning, middle, and close to the end. The thing is that those ideas are never fully developed and some even forgotten. The film's comedy is delivered in pastels, pink jokes that rarely made me laugh.Strangely, the film aesthetic, which is pastels, is not quite fully realized either: or pushed to its full vibrancy like in a WES ANDERSON film. The jokes are bland neither too sophisticated for adults to get them, or charmingly innocent for kids to enjoy them.Margo does a good job as Barbie, but is good good enough for a leading role where the fantasy was being sold to me? Honestly, I never actually believed it. Margo never looks like Barbie herself , aside the colors and the imposed name. She did what she could, but I never got the fantasy of Barbie. I believed Reese whiterspoon in legally blonde to be more Barbie like than Margo Robbie herself.The film has great refreshing moments like America ferrera's scenes , full of vigorous lines and life. Also, Ryan gosling gives an excellent portrayal of a ken with an existential crisis. The ending dancing number: fun and amazing. That number alone could potentially go for award nominations.Would I recommend the film to fans of Barbie, yes. Would I personally sit through to watch it again, no.All and all, I walked away the theater not knowing for sure what Barbie the movie was. It is the weakest project artistically speaking from Greta gerwig. In Barbie, Greta's magic and quirky comedic take on life is muddle among so many different things thrown together; it looses the comedy of Frances ha, and the driving force of nature that is lady bird."
"This movie represents in such a beautiful way what it is like to be a woman, and the grief we might feel growing up as one. I was so incredibly touched.Margo's acting was excellent and she is the perfect fit for Barbie.As well as Ryan. Perfect casting.I genuinely felt overflowing with love for women and felt the need to hug or hold hands with those around me.This movie did an excellent job making us women feel seen, not only as the 'girl boss' and other outdated feminist catchphrases, but also as the depth we have, and the devastating grief we feel when growing up as little girls into a world that wasn't as sympathetic as we initially thought it would be. Unfortunately it is mainly because of men and the patriarchy..
The thing with these type of movies is that a woman's perspective and a man's perspective are completely different.. most women I know that watched the movie felt as I did - love, grief, touched and understood.The men that have watched the movie did love it as well (and some hated it because of toxic masculinity) but most of them weren't touched. And I think that made me a little heartbroken..
Other than that - it's truly is a feminist masterpiece.I will definitely will be watching again."
"I like the overall feeling of the movie. It was created so beautifully and with such care and creativity and love for the Barbie universe
It was also so silly and fun.But it was alot and honstly a bit too long.It was saying alot of what felt like important things but somehow it felt flat.Maybe i just like a movie that just is a movie.Though it is so understandalbe that in that Barbie universe they like to explore and acknowledge those huge subjects such as gender equality. In that veiw the small problem i have is they may have tried to hard and the story got lost a bit.In the light of all that Someway somehow it becomes though fun a bit of an forgettable experience.Ps. Tiny Spolier: What about the kens. There story made me feel Abit sad and I wanted a happier ending for them."
"It was a really fun and re-watchable movie. It had some really relevant messages - the only negative is that it felt the movie couldn't decide how it was going to deliver those messages. It almost felt like 2 directors were on set- 1 that wanted a whimsical movie that didn't take itself seriously and one that wanted the movie to be social commentary and they thumb wrestled at the beginning of each scene to determine who directed it.I feel like the CEO/Mattel goons were unnecessary to the movie and Barbie's decision at the end was out of the blue and seemed to wrap up too quickly
Overall, though, a really creative film that I will buy on digital to watch repeatedly.Margot and Ryan were brilliant along with Simu Liu being a standout when he was on screen."
"Barbie is a film that on the outside appeals to a younger audience but it is certainly much more mature in overall nature.Barbie pushes the boundaries of what a people blindly may assume a Barbie movie should or would be able to- in both good ways, and bad ways.The good- Barbie is at many moments, fun, adaptive, emotional, even philosophically provoking. The story is enjoyable and attention-grabbing while both Gosling and Robbie have played their roles to a T. Margot Robbie played the ""stereotypical Barbie"" so well, almost too well at times. Ryan Gosling played Ken so well and the contrast between him in two different arcs of the film were not only distinct but all-believable. The costume design was superb and I was thoroughly impressed with some of the visuals and set design throughout. The CGI is very poor at a few scenes (which normally I would put under cons) BUT the film doesn't take its self too seriously during those scenes, so it's rather comical than anything.The bad- The writing of this film contains certain elements of contradiction; It essentially claims that women can (mostly) only be powerful by holding ""high societal job responsibilities,"" such as being a lawyer, doctor, president, etc; when this just simply isn't true, MOTHERS FOR EXAMPLE! Being a mother is one of (if not the biggest) responsibility a human can have- the idea of a collective job that can single handedly shift an entire generations thinking? Yeah, sorry but mother's are the most powerful. The film at several moments gets very political but subliminally and not-subliminally, which is always annoying no matter what political beliefs you carry, it's just almost always cringe I guess?TLDR;
""Barbie"" triumphs in being fun, engaging, and thought-provoking. The film, like many others, sells itself short by its political agenda and removes depth by doing so. Overall a mostly enjoyable experience meant for an adult audience.7.3/10."
"The Barbie movie is an absolute delight! It captivates audiences with its fantastic songs, creating a truly enchanting experience. The fun and engaging story will keep you hooked from start to finish, and the clever humor ensures there are plenty of laughs throughout the film. Plenty of Ken and Barbie for everyone. Makes everyone feel like they have a part to play. It's a must-watch for all ages, as it beautifully brings the beloved Barbie character to life in a way that leaves a lasting impression. Don't miss out on this enjoyable and mesmerizing cinematic adventure! Also, there is nothing after the end credits."
"Barbie is full of pros and consThe movie was fun and had wild adventures. I loved the fun characters and the dancing was INCREDIBLE! It was colorful and bright. Characters popping up from left and right exuding glitter and delight! The movie was all-around Barbie to the maximum even through the outfits!(Women are powerful and can make a change) The message was...stated...kind of...I think so...? The movie did not put it really out there. There were many moments that made you stop and say ""huh?"" as well as insert that awkward laugh you give when your nan/gramps/great aunt/kid says something they really shouldn't have said, or known, outloud. It gave me the feel of ""I Feel Pretty""; movie with the intention of getting a message across, but never really gets it there. Even the ending made me say ""Are you serious?""Overall, if you are looking for a movie with a good time, this one can be it. I did laugh a lot though, so there is that to look forward to."
"I went in with my sister who grew up watching animated Barbie movies since she was a kid like ""Barbie: Princess Charm School"" or ""Barbie: Princess and the Popstar"" or ""Barbie: Rapunzel,"" etc. I was excited, but more for her, because I know how much Barbie means to her. But sadly, she and I were very disappointed.Like to my sister, Barbie means something to girls everywhere, teaching the important and necessary values aimed at women, and giving them a role model to look up to. But after seeing this movie I can't tell you what Barbie stands for.In ""Barbie"" Margot Robbie's character is called a ""fascist"" and a terribly unrealistic image of a perfect woman. Ken is emasculated, fed sexist stereotypes and turned into a joke. The rest of the other Barbies are manipulative and standard feminist archetypes.I'm not political, but there's an obvious message the writers are pushing here. And it's not subtle at all. Men are worthless and Barbie's unique femininity is problematic.The best thing about the film is its wonderful costume design and special effects. But sadly, that's about it for ""Barbie."""
"Barbie was one of the most anticipated films of the year 2023. Many people made fun of him believing that he would be lame, and other people believed that he could actually be very good because of the cast and direction. Is it rough? In a way yes. But it's deliberately lame, they're living puppets, it's obvious that this is lame. The big complaint about the film is about the critics, as many people found it exaggerated and indeed it is, but again, it's on purpose. The criticism works very well, the characters work, the universe built here is incredible. Visually it is one of the most beautiful films of the year, a world all pink could be very strange, but it turned out beautiful and very convincing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are very good and manage to hold your attention, on the other hand, when they try to focus on other characters, the quality is not the same. Some characters don't work, particularly the businessmen who are featured in real life. Overall, this film is great and has earned its place among the best and most memorable films of 2023."
"Welcome back, Streamers! The most anticipated movie weekend of 2023 is here. It's Barbenheimer. If you haven't followed it, there's this ridiculous internet debate over which film will reign supreme between Greta Gerwig's Barbie and Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer...In this corner, coming in at 11.5 inches, it's the iconic, blonde fashion doll, Barbie.Barbie is the first live-action film about the American icon and her place in culture. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach wrote a screenplay, which Gerwig directs, that takes audiences into Barbieland, where we meet stereotypical Barbie (Marot Robbie) and her fellow Barbies living their perfect existences until one day stereotypical Barbie starts to think constantly about death, her feet become flat and other things are off. Barbie has to make a trek to the real world to find out why things have changed for her and to set them straight. Barbie is accompanied by Ken (Ryan Gosling), whose existence is so dependent upon Barbie that he only has a good day if Barbie looks at him. Rollerblading, hot pink singing and dancing hijinks ensue.Overall, Barbie is a weird and wonderful movie. It is clear that a lot of thought and money went into creating this story and world inhabited by Barbie. You will be awed by the clever production design and the intense attention to detail that went into constructing Barbieland. The colors pop. There are cute animated touches throughout. Additionally, the costume design enhances each Barbie and Ken in interesting ways. You'll also notice the music throughout the film is sometimes poignant and sometimes hilarious, especially when it involves the Kens. From top to bottom, the crafts in this movie are top notch and worthy of a trip to the big screen.The cast, especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, are excellent. Robbie brings sensitivity and heart to Barbie. She's thoughtful and kind while also being naive and troubled by her own existence. It is a tricky performance to pull off and Robbie is great. Ken is an iconic performance for Gosling. He pulls out all of the stops to bring Ken to life. I can't imagine another actor being as successful in this role. Gosling is a really gifted comedic actor as evidenced by this performance. I'll also note that Kate McKinnon, American Ferrar, Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Michael Cera and Issa Rae each have good moments as well. It's a big cast, but some of the smaller roles do get chances to shine.The main issue is that the messaging is so heavy-handed. There is a lot to unpack about Barbie's place in society. What does she represent to women and girls? What does she represent to men? There are themes of feminism, patriarchy, and corporate greed. The film does its best to address its issues in a clever and subversive way, but it veers into becoming patronizing at times rather than funny and satirical. The performances of the actors really carry the film across the finish line despite how it handles its themes.Ultimately, Barbie is a movie worthy of a trip to the theater. It is funny and even clever at times. The messaging of the movie gets heavy-handed and some of the subversive fun is lost in those moments. Nevertheless, Gosling and Robbie fully commit to their characters as does the large ensemble; and the production design and music are top notch. You won't be disappointed with a big box of popcorn. You decide if you want to wear hot pink like everyone else."
"I enjoyed the movie a lot with many jokes and sarcasm the characters keep throwing.It was interesting and unexpected view to face that barbie is a matriarchal concept. On the other hand, miserable but thriving Kens' lives with various music was very comical and fun. Such a landscape and world-setting is something only few of us have seen in real world where women have increasingly thrived for social power.Meanwhile, the storyline is pretty straightforward. It is a typical fantasy movie that a character goes to real world, cause a problem intertwined with the imaginary and real world and solve them together with real humans. So in that sense, there was no sequence of surprise as such. However, it was a movie with a good length of about 90 minutes, to casually enjoy watching with your family and friends!"
"This movie was incredible, it so perfectly portrays the patriarchy and feministic ideas. It really stood out to me how the worst the Kens had to go through in Barbieland was being ignored and being not very important, while the second Barbie went to the real world she was harassed and objectified. It ended up STILL being up to Barbie to ""apologize"" to Ken at the end of the movie though she did nothing wrong! This movie was hilarious and saddening and perfect, and it did a fantastic job of showing patriarchal things and balancing the serious and sad, with the funny and tender moments. I love Great Gerwig and would for sure see this again."
"As soon as the first teaser trailer dropped on YouTube for Barbie, it captured my attention and admiration for it recreated the ""Dawn of Men"" sequence from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey in a very creative and classic way. The hype of that one minute long clip, featuring (my celebrity crush) Margot Robbie who steals the show no matter what movie or role she is in, had me believing that this movie would be phenomenal. And over the course of several months until today, my expectations for this movie got bigger and bigger. This is partly thanks to the Barbenheimer online phenomenon which I followed and watched the both movies on the same opening day.Honestly, I didn't get everything I expected and I cannot say what I got is better than what I had expected. However, 2 hours of my time in front of that huge screen was pretty fun because Barbie is simply a very fun movie to watch and I absolutely loved it. I believe this is thanks to the feeling of watching it on the big screen with a bunch of strangers around to laugh with. I will definitely watch the movie again upon the digital release to try to prove myself wrong.Margot Robbie is, as always, phenomenal in the movie. Her incredible talent and charm carries almost the entire film, not to mention that she is a co-producer. She is not the best casting choice to play a Barbie doll but in this particular Barbie movie, she was born for the role. Her co-star Ryan Gosling is the comedic heart of the movie. Without him, the movie would certainly not be as fun as it is. The rest of the cast also compliment their roles fairly well, playing iconic characters and dolls of different races and sizes.I was expecting a longer, a more serious and elaborate plot for Barbie but what I got instead is not too bad. The movie clearly carries a message and that message is clearly conveyed through a plot that is brief and basically easy to understand which is built up in a favorable way.The production design and the costume design is certainly a huge part of the film. All the costumes, sets, props and everything look and feel so compelling and, most important of all, accurate to the overall history and legacy of Barbie and Mattel. I hugely respect that attention to detail.At the end of the day, Barbie is a movie I have been impatiently waiting for a long time and that I feel honored to have seen today on the opening day. It is a beautiful work of art paying beautiful homage to the legacy of it's origins and I am happy that I started loving this movie way before its release . . ."
"Barbie is a beautifully heart-warming extravaganza for both boys and girls alike. A gloriously pink, joy-filled experience that I can't wait to go and see again. From the wonderful set design and perfect casting to the brilliant soundtrack and story to match, there is something for everyone to enjoy.I can't pay more respect to the cast, Margot Robbie as stereotypical Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken are the obvious standouts, they certainly delivered on the hype - but I was pleasantly surprised by Will Ferrell's short but hilarious moments on screen as well as Michael Cera as Alan (a true unsung hero).As mentioned, the set design is really quite stunning. Gazing upon Barbie land in all it's pink glory is pure joy, there is no doubt the set design is one of the films greatest strengths. But Barbie doesn't just look great, it sounds great with its vibrant collection of tracks and performances (including Ryan Gosling and his guitar).Barbie wraps up all the fun and colour with a solid story and strong positive message that fits perfectly in the world Greta Gerwig created. Of course some people may not enjoy the social commentary that pervades Barbie but I believe Greta Gerwig laid out the foundations for such a message perfectly, empowering girls and boys of all ages.Barbie feels like a must see movie, it built the hype and then delivered exceptionally. If you haven't been tempted yet you're missing out on all the fun that this beautiful movie has to offer."
"Not just the intro, but the whole movie is funny and smart as hell. You are griped by the voice of Helen Mirren, interactive singing by Liso and a strong focus on humor. The details in Barbieland are hilarious. There is no water in the shower or glasses, the pool is a decoration, every night is a girl's night. It shows you how great imagination is, especially kids imagination. And it guides you to perceive the movie with an open mind. After Barbie and Ken enter the real world, it can be even more unhinged and crazy than Barbieland. What helps you to just go with it, is that this 'real world' is also shown as fiction, in details. The all the way up button in the elevator, the immediate response of the director of Mattel, that they had to get Barbie in the box, meeting the ghost of an old lady. It really helps you to let that absurd concept entertain you on every level. So you laugh a lot, cry a bit, feel motivated and you hope that everyone is truly listening to the message to love yourself."
"I was super excited for the movie since the day they announced it and I've been looking forward to it. I was ready with my pink shirt, popcorn and tickets to the early screening expecting a fun loving and very pink movie.And it sure was a very pink and fun loving movie, but I was not expecting the turn it took. It made me go through so many emotions I wasn't expecting to feel, twist and turns that made me laugh, moments that made me cry and the ending was fantastic to say the least.The Barbie Movie is everything I was expecting and so much more, I think the highlight, other than the amazing message, casting and storytelling, was when John Cena appeared.In summary, I'm not the same person I was 1h and 54m ago."
"I wasn't expecting much, after all, it is a movie about a doll - however, I was pleasantly surprised that it managed to develop a story that it was relevant and had a strong emotional core.Obviously, it isn't without flaws: it got too campy for my tastes (but not fully over-the-top) and it got a little too lost in its own message towards the end. Regardless, it never lost the entertainment factor that a movie about Barbie should have - so I can only give props to the director and the actors.For the first few minutes, I was worried that the movie was going to be just ""stupid fun"" but as they progressed the plot, it got better and better - I think the resolution of both plotlines of Barbie and Ken were brilliant and quite satisfying.The highlight was the comedy, the relationship between the characters and their commentary about feminism, consumerism and patriarchy."
"I have been thinking for 2 days and still I have no idea who the target audience for this film is. The first half of this movie is not bad at all but once Barbie and Ken leave barbieland the movie just completely falls apart. The message shoved in your face way too much and isnt subtle at all, characters that are set up early on are completely forgotten by the 3rd act in a bloated script filled with unnecissarily complex feministic views. For a movie about a children's toy, the dialogue is often much too complex and theres no way in hell a child is going to be able to understand whats going on; several lines left me scratching my head as the dialogue is way too overly complex. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are excellent casting choices with Gosling going above and beyond, nailing all of the comedic moments and elevating all of the material he was given to work with.For a movie I was incredibly excited for, I was severely let down and honestly cannot say I recommend this movie to anyone. If you are going to only see one blockbuster this summer, make it Mission Impossible or Oppenheimer, you are not missing out on much here."
"I may not have played with Barbie dolls and fairly no interest in this from a subject standpoint, but I have to say this movie rocks. Margot Robbie is awesome, Gerwig's direction is solid, the writing is well thought out, the colors pop, and let's not forget how amazing Ryan Gosling is in this. His Ken will go down in history as one of his best roles, calling it now. I do wish there were things that were more utilized in the film, especially Venice Beach as a location. It felt really shoe horned into the plot. Also some of the side characters just really didn't need to be there. But overall, this picture really works because it's messaging about the hardships of the modern woman is spot on. Also I liked how they actually critiqued Mattel at times for making a doll with insane beauty standards for young children. I'm definitely looking forward to see where Gerwig takes her career after this because this is truly a box office and critical smash that can lead to some interesting projects in the future."
"Absolutely AMAZING!!!!I do not know how it is possible but the Barbie movie exceeded my expectations and then some!!! It was sooooo dang hilarious!!!I love the silliness, aesthetics and nostalgia of it all plus the laughs just kept on coming. Of course they had to build a story so there were a few long monologues but there were soooo many laugh out loud moments throughout the whole movie.Also, Lets talk about Ryan Gosling...Who knew he was so funny.. He killed it as Ken! I was not expecting him to be so good. I will definitely be going back to the movies to watch it again...Oh yeah, BTW Its DEFINITELY PG-13 so I wouldn't bring the kids.."
"I enjoyed the film more for its choreography and the characters' sympathy than for the confusing message. Is it that Ken should understand he was created to be Barbie's friend forever? Is it that a man in love must surrender to a second place? I hope I can read the actual purpose of the story from the writers.Barbieland is shown as a happy monotonous human-like world with empty containers resembling our not so happy monotonous real life where men condescend with a higher ranked male model, something a second rank character wished to be back at his fantasy world. Please, if anyone finds out the actual mess-age let me know."
"If you are expecting it to be so stupid ur gonna love it... Ur in the right place. I refused to watch extras and trailers, I wanted to be surprised. And I was! It's cheesey AF at first.. if u can get past 15 mins of everyone saying the name Barbie, you will survive this movie. In the beginning they ""flip"" through past Barbies and I seen quite a few that used to own.. they also ""flash"" through some barbie clothes that will bring u right back to childhood. For nastalgia sake this movie will not disappoint... For new comer's sake, this movie will not disappoint! We counted the reasons why it's rated PG-13 and it's kinda hilarious.I hope there's a second movie... Barbie and The Rockers!!!!"
"First, the good bits. I thoroughly enjoyed the cast, even got to see some favorites in semi-major roles. For a blockbuster movie like this, good acting is to be expected. I also, as many fellow viewers pointed out, enjoyed the intricacies that made the movie seem like it was scripted by a kid. That was the whole point with the floating and dramatics-things that can only happen in imagination actually happen in the movie.Now, while I enjoyed the movie and didn't see it as preachy at all-in fact, I think it did a great job of saying what Barbie stood for if it wasn't a perfect woman no girl could become-it could've been better. The plot, while purposely childlike, seemed rushed and half-finished towards the end. Without going to a means of spoiling, I wished for better character development and realism in stead of useless scenes that did nothing but spotlight good looks and physique. This movie COULD'VE been a transformational experience along the lines of ""when perfect isn't good enough."" I really just got a couple rounds of laughs, some nods of approval, and mere silence looking at a movie that even it didn't know where it was going.TL;DR - It's a good movie-not a great movie."
Being a huge barbie fan I had to go watch this movie and let me tell you it did not disappoint. Started as a fun kids movie but took a. Wry interesting turn with its story line.The display of patriarchy in real world using barbie land was so smartly done.A great direction with attention to details that makes this so much fun to watch.Some of the moments will make you burst out laughing and some will make you really emotional.It's a movie for every age group but absolutely a must watch for teenagers.My fiancé watched it with me who doesn't know anything about barbies but has a wonderful time. He rated it 8/10 so that's quite a lot.Enjoy.
"Very entertaining, and fun. Does not take itself too seriously. Very good satirical acting. Props, and set building is very creative and in-depth. Ryan Gosling is great, and really funny. The plot and message are annoying though. Starts from the beginning with a very delusional message, and does not let up. Even though I tried to ignore the very delusional message throughout, the ending makes no sense. Barbie herself ends up not solving her problem, still being confused, and staying in the real world when she wanted everything back to normal during the whole movie. That makes no sense whatsoever. The very last line of dialogue is a fail of a joke too. The director obviously did not know how to end the movie."
"There was a lot of hype leading up to this movie, because of the cast and simply because it's a movie about Barbie. This movie 100% backed up it's hype. This was a very funny movie with a great storyline. I am going to be honest, I was not expecting it to be that good of a storyline and it truly was.It was a weirdly funny movie that also had good morals and a great message behind it. Ryan Gosling stole the show and cracked up the audience basically every-time he appeared on the screen (along with Will Ferrell of course)
Margot Robbie did a phenomenal job as Barbie. Overall it was an amazing watch and no reason this movie should receive any hate!"
"I enjoyed the creation of the Barbie world, the costumes, set design, and I think the angle they took in terms of themes was interesting and relevant. The script, however, was not that solid.They were going for a direct, transparent, explain the deep themes of the story type of dialogue, but it often had a hard time landing. Particularly at the beginning. Some things felt spoon-fed to the audience, as if they weren't going to understand the givens of Ken realizing he loved the patriarchy because he felt he had never had any voice in Barbie Land. We visually understand it, but then it is explained a fee times through on the nose dialogue which felt unnecessary.The pacing of the film feels a bit awkward at times. You also never fuuully connect with the characters and their struggles, even though Margot Roby and Ryan Gosling are amazing actors and enjoyable to watch. You're following a line of events and laid out comments about the patriarchy and the place of women in todays world. But it was exactly the most profound (which is fiiiine, it's a movie about a doll after-all, but if they were going for this pov they should've dug deeper, in my opinion).I love all the actors involved, and the work of Greta Gerwig and the work of Noah Baumbach. But this wasn't their best work.I would still recommend seeing it to form your own opinion. You can still enjoy the world, the acting, and have a laugh here and there. Also, for people who have never taken a look at our binary, sexist, and patriarchal society, it could be eye opening. For my part, I often think about how exhausting it is to live in a world where men are in most positions of power and impose their ways on others, particularly women, so I wanted more out of the argument of the movie. Deeper."
"Barbie movie was very under my expectations.The movie per total was a kitsch... from beggining to the end.I expected a more interesting story, perhaps with some decent lines of comedy.The regisor didn't had a vision, she just hurry up to create a piece of something, just to be there in cinemas to gather money.The regisor just took advantage of the big name and popularity of Barbie toy.Mains actors were blunt. No emotions, superficialityThe morala: Humans have just one ending..
What we all have to remember from this movie, is that all humans have just one ending... Death. - A curse from our ""Loving Creator"""
"When I went to watch this movie, I went to watch it as the amazing combo, Barbinheimer (Barbie and Oppenheimer). I tried my best to avoid spoilers for both of these movies, and let me just say, going into this movie blind made this a phenomenal experience. The way Stereotypical Barbie changes is a pleasant surprise. And the way this movie deals with problems in modern society upfront and, while admittedly toned down a bit, they're all still there. The plot of this movie makes it a fantastic watch, and I was delighted by not only how the jokes were seamlessly thrown in, but the jokes themselves. This movie wasn't only just Kenough. This was so much more than being just Kenough for the children and adults in the audience. The movie's so self-aware, but it isn't the usual type, this is a type of self-awareness that can lead you to view the world differently. The problems Barbie struggles with aren't unreasonable, they're relatable at heart and spread a good message. This movie is wonderful and I highly recommend it."
"The acting was amazing. Ryan Gosling should win an award for this. There was much laughter, tears, dancing, and conflict which all played out well. The acting resembled the characters as toys, down to every little detail. Phenomenal acting! The movie shows that Barbie and Ken, and the other characters have been completely thought out. The development was very deep and relates to the audience very well. The dialogue was great, too, as there was just enough of it, showing depth. Ties into the plot and theme thoroughly.Barbie has impacted girls for many years and the movie introduces the audience to a light hearted history of it. Barbie is supposed to be perfect and experience every day at its best. But the world of Barbie the audience sees is far from perfect, and it is separated from the real world of those who actually play with her. The plot development was amazing, as Barbie goes on a mission to discover herself and save her Barbie world. In the meantime like the slogan says, ""She's everything. He's just Ken."" Ken is also having a crisis in being number two, and questions how he fits into the Barbie world. As both toys deal with their identity crises, the themes of empowerment, patriarchy, feminism, and being yourself comes into play. Other valuable life lessons are shown as well that makes this movie memorable for women and even men. The themes are powerful and heartwarming, yet raw and honest. The sound was bubbly and popping, the graphics impressed me the most. From the costumes, to the plasticity of objects, to the action everything was visually effective. The camera angles were also notable.This movie was very upbeat and much more hilarious than I orginally anticipated. The movie resonates with what its like as they tackle the real world. The movie brings so many elements from various generations of Barbie and the audience learns about the creator and what it means to be-Barbie. As she and Ken both question their existence, the heart of the movie centers on the impact that they make towards themselves and others. With fantastic graphics, dancing and song, humor, and life lessons this movie makes it a captivating film that everyone will surely enjoy!"
"Visually, it was a great movie to watch - colourful, cute and quirky. I enjoyed the first 20 - 30 minutes and then it went downhill from there. There's a lot of fantastic actors in it but I didn't go in with high expectations as I had no idea what to expect.For the story itself - sure, there were some morals and statements presented but it was a bit flat and a lot of the same. I left feeling totally underwhelmed. Gosling was great though. A few bits did make me laugh but it struggled to hold my attention. As sometimes happens, a lot of the funny parts were in the film trailers. I wouldn't watch it a second time through."
"I don't know if I've ever seen anything quite like Barbie, which is rewarding if you ask me, especially since I haven't been this excited for any other release this year. So what did I think of it?For starters, I really admire the production of this movie. Gorgeous does not begin to describe the sets, and it's commendable how well they highlight the surrealism of Barbieland. I had seen a YouTube video exploring Barbie's Dreamhouse and already concluded in my mind that it was pretty great, but seeing it in the context of the movie just made it better. The costumes are great too.Furthermore, the acting is alright! Huge props to Margot Robbie. The movie blends humour and angst with some other tonal elements, which means that it demands more from the actors than you would assume at first. The ensemble cast was obviously up to the task, but something in their performances caught my attention. I vaguely remember Gerwig mentioning in an interview the issue of considering the technicalities of a typical Barbie's movements. You can notice several points in the movie where the actors embrace the stiff and wooden movements of a doll, but at other less noticeable or relevant moments, they're as flexible as a living entity whilst in Barbieland. I don't know how one would navigate a perfectly adequate balance between the two, but my brain couldn't ignore this mild inconsistency, whether you consider it important or not (and I do). The film did utilize this for comedic effect though, and I thought that was a nice touch.While there are more things I like than dislike about this movie, I feel like the execution leaves something to be desired. The first act of the movie is everything I'd hoped it would be; campy, funny, and exceedingly pink. I love that even the subsequent scenes in Barbieland embrace this quirkiness, irrespective of the stakes. However, the transition from Barbie and Co's everyday shenanigans to her journey of awareness and self-discovery felt a bit... sudden? While it aptly gives focus to the main conflict of the movie, I feel like the heavy marketing of the movie had already given away too many glimpses of Barbieland before I saw the film. It took away the element of wonder and left the superficial part of me a little disappointed. Also, the final two-thirds of the movie is just shy of overstimulating. I hate to say it, but the reinforcement of women empowerment ideals isn't done tastefully and comes off harsher than it should, and the sharp tonal change preceding it doesn't help. The exploration of switched gender roles from Barbieland to the real world was another clever idea whose execution lacked finesse. This made Ryan Gosling's Ken briefly unlikeable to me; he saved the performance with his undeniable charisma and sense of humour. And even though I thought the ending was a nice surprise (that scene with the Billie Eilish number is one of the most beautiful things ever), I was sadly distracted by the non-subtlety of the preceding events, however funny or thoughtful they were. Perhaps I would appreciate it better with a second watch.So yeah, Barbie is an experience. Tune in for the colourful heaps of fun, and stay for the emotional and humanistic themes. But beware of the untidy edges."
"A movie that delivered a great few laughs, with Gosling taking the show. Margot was fantastic, really showcasing her talent as an actor. However, for the main character of the show it did not seem that way - Ken took most of the limelight. Rightfully so with Ryan playing a stellar part.The story starts off light hearted and fun but takes a dive with preaching against the patriarchy. While granted in this day and age, there's a limit to the level of guff one can take.A colourful and fun movie that always tries to be more than it can be. Probably not a good idea to bring young kids as the premise and message will go over their heads."
"I went into Wednesday expecting to write things like ""the greatest weekend in cinema"", ""Oppenheimer brings cinema to the screen again"", ""Barbie wins the weekend""... But this is so much more than that.Barbie was perfect. It shows something that I was able to experience for the first time in my life: the artistic pleasure of movies as a communal and cultural experience. Although watching Titanic was one of the greatest communal experiences of my life, it's the immediate cultural relevance of Barbie that makes it a first for me. It's the best that movies can be. And above all else, in six years time this might be looked back upon as one of the best movies of the decade.In the consumerist world's perfect fantasy sold to little girls as a toy-the polished plastic world of Barbie-everything is perfect. Starting with Barbie herself. Until the doll experiences something all too common to the real world but inexplicably strange to hers: an inexplicable desire to die. We get acquainted with the situation following a musical set-piece opening of the kind that tells you you're in for a great ride! (A pleasure made double for any Dua Lipa fan!)As it turns out, someone in the real world (Gloria (America Ferrera) a woman working an office job at Mattel) has communicated these emotions to her. It's now up to Barbie to travel to the real world to repair the rift in the space-time continuum. Her typical but good guy boyfriend Ken joins in for the ride.In the sweet and softhearted comedy that follows, Ken and Barbie make their first encounter with the real world, where Barbie finds out she's only ever sexualized, and Ken is treated with a newly discovered respect that he never knew in the Barbie world. Gradually, he discovers the patriarchy. When Barbie finally meets Gloria and her teenage daughter (beautifully cast and great showing from young Ariana Greenblatt) after they help her escape a chase with the corporate goons at Mattel that preside upon the cubical empire, the journey is done and they happily return to Barbieland. Only there's one problem: Ken has brought the patriarchy back home!With the visual representations of masculinity in popular culture (pretty much Rocky Balboa), outrageous rocker outfits, and a great fancy of horses (I share this with Ken I have to say), Ken has now amassed all the aesthetics he needs to firmly establish the rule of the patriarchy in Barbieland. The comedy is bafflingly funny, and the subject is urgently topical.I've lately had the feeling that movies today weren't as important as they used to, that they didn't mean as much and like Quentin Tarantino said and I agree, ""they're not in the zeitgeist (the spirit of the age)."" This movie was right in the zeitgeist!It's thanks to a collaboration between Warner Brothers, Mattel (kudos to them for having the sense of humor), and an artist like Greta Gerwig that we're able to have her take something so deeply established in the pop culture and marry it with the standalone work of an artist and its integrity. The result is something I've never seen in a theater before.In a scene where Barbie is experiencing an emotional breakdown, Gloria transitions into a long-running monologue about how it was like for her to be a woman in today's world. I sat and watched and thought it might had been something a bit clichéd and worn out. Everyone had settled into silence. Then the moment Gloria was done with the monologue, there was a pause, with her and with the audience, then the whole room erupted into applause! I joined right in! What the hell did I know... When the movie kept getting more and more exciting, and just transitioned into a modern-day musical set-piece this time around, people were so with it they had to applaud again. It was a truly great thing to see. (US audiences and people in Marvel movies are known to cheer for many things, but this was a different degree of sincerity.) At the end of it there was a buzz in the room, like everyone had just been part of something special.Essentially you know it's a great situation, you have no idea where the movie might go next, and it keeps coming up with the right answer every single time. It's perfect.More props to Greta; like all the truly great movies, it's also very personal. At first it's personal in the relevant but quirky mention of Rocky Balboa and The Godfather as symbols of the male-revolving world-movies that she herself wanting to be a filmmaker had had to deal with as deeply cherished and highly regarded in the masculine opinion around her-and it's personal again in the ending, and what she sees as most cherishable about being human, in what will stay with me as one of the classic shots of all time. The shot comes with Margot Robbie's perfecting of the single-eyed tear and using it the way you imagine they would in the great old times of cinema, except it's that much better because the times are today.I've seen reviews (The Guardian) calling this a feminist thesis. It's neither a thesis (see Women Talking) nor a dogma. It's entirely cultural. And despite the story largely being a comedy about women banding together and helping each other break free of the omnipotent clamps of the patriarchy, Ken, who is an absolute joy in this movie, is treated to a delicate ending as well. The role was also a total gift of a role and Ryan Gosling was right there for it.It's also the movie's quality as a journey of spiritual discovery, confrontation, and self-actualization, along with the great tradition of the Hollywood ending, that bring everything together and make this a proper pop culture opus.As far as what this implies for the industry, this is the first time that we'll be able to have a strongly established director that isn't one of the folks who made their name in the 90s. This is not to say that Greta Gerwig is now going to make a Barbie every other year, nor does she have to. This is her Pulp Fiction, her Raiders of the Lost Ark, and dare I say her Godfather (wink wink). May she enjoy it. But she's definitely on my short list now of the most exciting directors working today, and someone that can carry the torch of great cinema wherever she goes next. I remember hearing her answer with Singin' in the Rain (1952) to a favorite movie question in a roundtable interview, and thinking who was this girl. Then I happened to see Singin' in the Rain a month later, and I knew that girl was cool.Finally, I'm glad that an entire generation of young girls gets to grow up with a movie like this available to them. It's definitely not something Greta's generation had, not quite. It's also a culmination of the last ten years of popular culture, which is why I think it's one of the best movies of this period. But it's also gonna be remembered and talked about for decades to come. And based on its feminist scope, it might be already one of the most important movies of the 21st century."
"This movie was just so fun to watch. I'm not personally a fan of barbie, never really played with them or interacted with the IP in anyway, but just the pure outlandish absurdity of this movie and the over-the-top acting... I couldn't stop laughing throughout most of the runtime.Based on how the movie was marketed, I was 100% expecting to be pondering the question, ""what does it mean to exist?"" by the end. Well, the movie pondered the question, came to a conclusion, and then told me what that conclusion was in a way that was very clear and easy to understand. Personally, I like when a movie isn't exactly clear. I like when I have to dig a little, think about it, discuss it with other people. With Barbie, I felt no need for that. The message was crystal clear. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing, but it was just a little too on the nose for my taste.All in all, a super fun watch. I saw this with my family. We bought popcorn, milkshakes, and it was a great time."
"This movie was so much lively and joyful. Also filled a lot of pink
It was so amazing. It's like dream worldSometimes movies that make us happy and hopeful about life are really required a lot in order to survive in this depressing worldThis movie is a literally a portal towards happiness, to escape sadness for whileThank you Greta Gerwig for directing such an amazing movie
Really appreciated
Ready to see more of your amazing workAnd let me tell all of you that this movie doesn't represent anything
This is just a normal movie that should be enjoyed
Pls don't judge and make anything out of thisAnd this doesn't support wokeism in any way
And pls don't compare this movie to Oppenheimer
Both movies are from a complete different genreGreta Gerwig cannot be compared to Christopher Nolan in any way
She tried very hard and her work was good
Hats offIf you ask me Barbie or Oppenheimer
Obviously my answer is OppenheimerOppenheimer is one of the best movies of this century
And the best movie of the yearSo Oppenheimer is the best movie
But Barbie is also good movieHence we shouldn't fight over it
And watch both."
"I saw this movie the other night and had a phenomenal experience. However, I've needed to sit on it for a little while because there were certain elements that I wasn't sure how to feel about. First, Ken. The character himself was hilarious and Ryan Gosling did an outstanding job doing him justice. I loved how his plot discussed radicalization into patriarchal thinking, (like, the guy just wanted to learn about horses! But pipelines into misogyny are literally everywhere, so Ken, being naive, just falls into it), as well as the societal expectation of *needing* to be in a romantic relationship to a codependent extent, leading into incel ideology.The thing that rubbed me the wrong way was how in the end, after he became his normal self, it felt as if the movie just expected me to be laughing along with him again... like, I still don't wanna be rooting for this guy. Seeing people's response to him as a character after the movie had me confused. I understand, Ryan Gosling is so fine, but Ken is not your babygirl! He still tried to install a patriarchal state and never really apologized!!The plot with the real-world Mattel executives also just felt a little unnecessary to me. It was funny, don't get me wrong, but it just kind of happened and I wasn't sure what to glean from it. At one point I found myself thinking, like, what happened to those guys?? And then they just kinda showed up at the end. I also know it was meant to be commentary on Mattel's predominantly male leadership, but... like, YOU are Mattel. You have a male CEO. Like thanks for addressing it, but you have no room to talk.I think some of the time with this unnecessary plot point could've been used to touch a bit more on body image issues, because that is a HUGE criticism of the Barbie brand. Like, okay. You had one token fat Barbie with an otherwise entirely straight-sized cast. But some of the jokes were just like ""pregnant people are weird 😂"" and they never entirely said ""hey cellulite is not scary its just how it happens""
I think they *tried* to do something about aging being beautiful but it was not really explicit enough to come across. I think it could've been pretty easy to incorporate a scene, like when Barbie tried tea for the first time, to be like wow! Indulging in pleasures with your food is good and not an indicator of your moral value!Despite my criticisms, I would say this movie is a must-watch. The points it makes are really important. And I actually found the comedy funny instead of cringe, which is rare for me with these types of films!More of a 7.5/10 than a 7, if I had to say."
"What a damn shame. A PG-13 Barbie movie from Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach with Margo Robbie and Ryan Goshling, intended for those who loved and hated Barbie. I was looking forward to seeing Barbie. However, even those who hated Barbie would not call her fascist. This film borrows from so many films, The Truman Show, The Lego Movie, Legally Blonde, Toy Story 1-3, Singing In The Rain, Born Yesterday, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, and so many more. Other films which I could not help but recall how they got it right, where this film did not.Barbie is more than a film about iconic dolls coming to life. Filled with a lot of heavy messages, all of which are hard not to miss, and all of which are very forcefully delivered...repetitively. A week ago, I saw Oppenheimer. Had it been on the same level as Barbie, we would've been hearing the words, ""Nukes are bad"" over and over and over throughout the whole film. Yes, it would've been an extremely annoying experience. We, the audience, know nukes are beyond bad. The film gave its audience the respect in knowing this. Barbie, holds nothing back in constantly spelling out the same messages for its audiences. Did they seriously think the audience would not get any of these directly stated messages? Barbie has little faith in its audience and treats us like....dolls. In fact, Oppenheimer is over an hour longer and yet Barbue felt longer.I do agree with several of the points the film makes, but it's not done in a clever or impacting way. Not just in one or two scenes, but in dozens. One of the biggest messages is feminism and inequality, to which I agree with many points the film, not so subtly makes. However, most of the arguments can be said for both sexes.The film aims to be a battle of the sexes, but instead ends up less of a battle between men and women and more between privileged middle class and d-bags.There was a little enjoyment with Barbie. Margo Robbie and especially Ryan Goshling both look like they're having a blast with their characters. The production design of Barbieworld is wonderful. There were some laughs scattered throughout, about 1 in every 4th joke. Gerwig did a fine job directing this, but the script ultimately brought the film down.One other thing which ruined the experience for me was the audience. The 9pm audience on a Monday night of a nearly sold out show would not stop talking, or giggling during scenes which were dramatic and not comedy. One of the movie's best scene between Barbie and her creator which is a somber moment, had girls giggling left and right. Barbie was one of the worst theater experiences for me and my wife, who said it was the worst theater experience she's ever had, and even though she liked the film the audience around us ruined her enjoyment. Will say, at least Barbie was better than The Dial of Destiny."
"I am a big fan of the actress Margot Robbie. I loved her last year in ""Babylon"" and ""Amsterdam"". And before those I loved her in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and as Harley Quinn in ""Suicide Squad"", ""Birds of Prey"" and ""The Suicide Squad"".I also liked Ryan Gosling in ""La la land"".Now here they are together in ""Barbie"" directed by Greta Gerwig, who did such a great job with ""Little Women"" and ""Lady Bird"".I didn't know what to expect from a movie about a Barbie doll but this movie is a very entertaining and fun movie that brings Barbie's world to life with great production design and costumes and good cinematography.I couldn't imagine another actress playing this part as perfectly as Margot Robbie does here. She is a great movie star. The supporting cast is also excellent including Will Ferrell as the CEO of Mattel. I had a great time with the movie ""Barbie""."
"I went to see Barbie in theaters today, and it is one of the best comedies of this year.The story is really good, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling did awesome as Barbie and Ken, respectively, the production design is amazing, Greta Gerwig's direction was pretty good, and the soundtrack was great. Billie Eilish's song ""What Was I Made For"" was also so good.Barbie is one of the best movies of 2023, and my fifth favorite movie of 2023 so far. I recommend going to see it in theaters. Even anyone who isn't a fan of the Barbie dolls will enjoy this movie. This is also the 2007 live-action Bratz movie done right."
"Basically a Mattel remake of Heaven Can Wait: A person travels to a separate 'reality' to better understand who they are and what they have to offer in this world, and how the two worlds are connected. Add to it the fun movie opening rip off of 2001 Space Odyssey, it's hard to say that this is a very original movie. However, Margot Robbie brings it home and grounds the emotional side of the movie beautifully. The colour palette and the messages are worthwhile, ballsy directing and old for this role but excellent Gosling make it worth seeing. Will we remember this movie few years from now? No. But doesn't mean it's not worth seeing."
"I was not expecting this movie to be great; I'm not into this kind of stuff, but still, I watched it, and man, it was great; some scenes are relatable to how people react to something nowadays, like, come on, everything and everyone can be cancelled, the overall acting of the cast is super great. I love it; almost all the song are catchy and complements the movie (like this song, by the way (Im just Ken)); the production set for this film is majestic, and parts of the movie are touching and somewhat relatable to our everyday life, and there can be something to learn from, very recommended to watch this with your whole family and friends."
"Walking into the theater I was expecting a silly, outrageous, fun contrast to the competing new release of ""Oppenheimer"", but instead I found much more. Not only did this movie have incredible humor, but a deep insight to what it means to be a woman. The light it brought to the deep connection to mother's and daughters...especially the moment shared between Margot Robbie and Ruth Handler, was nothing short of a tear-jerker. Not only that, but the wide spectrum of representation of connection between women was remarkable; from the shared struggle of patriarchal restraints we experience to the common childhood memories of playing with dolls. I have seen some critics who hate magic, fun, and women, be quick to hate on the heavy speech America Ferrera gives in the third act about standards women must meet. Sure, it didn't fit the theme of Barbieland's perfect, pink atmosphere, but it was a powerful message needed to strengthen the impact of the movie. Her message was followed by an applause by the audience of the theater I was in.I left the theater in awe of how incredible this movie was and how incredible this movie made me feel. It spoke to me in ways that cheesy, ""relatable"", lazily anti-capitalist and cheap feminist media could never do. This movie is brilliant and inspiring for young girls such as myself. I felt loved and seen throughout this whole movie and felt so strongly about it I went through the hassle of making a damn IMDB account and writing an essay that wasn't required by a teacher or school project. I actually felt the need to share how this movie impacted me instead of letting the horse loving Ken's of the world speak over the women who felt a real connection to this movie. It is beautiful and a must watch."
"Barbie can offer genuine fun when enjoyed with a partner and a carefree attitude, but I strongly advise against watching it in the cinema. The movie lacks the expected nostalgia that a Barbie film should evoke, and it is riddled with hypocrisy and statements that don't hold true within the storyline.At its best, the movie is decent. The acting overral is commendable, especially with Margot Robbie delivering a great performance and being a good fit for her role. Some scenes are enjoyable and endearing, capable of eliciting laughter and providing a good time, but they don't leave a lasting impact. The soundtrack, from my perspective, was consistently great throughout the film with just a couple odd choices.However, my main issue with the movie lies in its overt push of social and political views onto the audience. Instead of letting the viewers interpret the themes on their own, the film explicitly spells out its messages, which can be off-putting. The movie seems too focused on trying to please every audience, resulting in a predictable Hollywood cliché.Moreover, it appears that the film fails to cater to two significant demographics. Younger viewers might struggle to follow the movie and comprehend its messages, leaving them disconnected and confused. On the other hand, older audiences, who would have been the main target for nostalgic appeal, may find this aspect lacking in the film, missing an opportunity to connect on a deeper level.In summary, while Barbie can be enjoyable when approached with the right mindset and company, the movie falls short of meeting expectations. The strong performances and some fun moments are marred by heavy-handed messaging and a failure to deliver the nostalgia that fans were hoping for."
"I can only recommend to see this joyful movie with an incredible cast.If you like fun, creativity, colors and a great plot that is both entertaining and thoughtful this is one of the best movies you can see.Songs are OK but choreographies are amazing. Everything in the movie is weird but in the best sense because it is unlike any other movie. Ryan Gosling plays both a brilliant regular guy and kinda stupid at the same time, which is super cute and sensitive. While the movie is full of intentional stupidity and fun, it makes us man rethink manhood, not really because of the feminist discourse - which is a bit too much present here - but in more subtile way because of Gosling's character reactions and evolution throughout the movie.It is also a movie about American culture at its best : Barbieland is a reflection of America and vice-versa. The plot nourishes itself brilliantly from that reflection and challenges both men and women's conception of our dreams. Consumerism, business, idealism, self deprecative humour, all ingredients are there. The only downside we can find to this movie is the labyrinth style plot that is too stretched sometimes and unnecessary. More importantly this makes it unsuitable for younger audience. Thank you Mattel for this piece of fun !!"
"When I first heard about the release of ""Barbie"" in 2023, I must admit I didn't have high expectations. After all, it's a movie based on a doll beloved by generations of young girls, and I wasn't sure how that would translate into a compelling cinematic experience. However, I was in for a pleasant surprise!The direction of the film was truly on point. It managed to take a simple concept and turn it into a captivating story with well-paced storytelling. The director skillfully brought Barbie's world to life, giving the audience a fresh and exciting perspective on the iconic toy.One of the standout aspects of the movie was its ability to balance comedy and heart. The inclusion of good comic punchlines added a delightful layer of humor, ensuring that the film appeals to both young and older audiences. It's no easy feat to strike the right balance in a movie like this, but ""Barbie"" managed to do just that.The performances by the actors were commendable. Despite the unconventional nature of portraying a doll on the big screen, all the actors played their parts exceptionally well. They breathed life into their characters and made the audience emotionally invested in their journey.What impressed me the most was the emotional depth that the movie managed to achieve. Considering it is based on a toy, it could have been easy to dismiss it as a mere cash-grab with no real substance. However, ""Barbie"" proved me wrong by exploring meaningful themes and evoking genuine emotions. It touched on friendship, self-discovery, and the importance of staying true to oneself - messages that resonate not only with children but also with adults.In conclusion, ""Barbie"" surpassed my expectations and delivered an enjoyable and heartwarming cinematic experience. It's a movie that manages to entertain with its humor and engaging storytelling, while also providing valuable life lessons. Whether you're a fan of the iconic doll or not, ""Barbie"" is a film that will leave you with a smile on your face and a warm feeling in your heart.It's a solid 7.3 for me."
"I went into the theatre thinking this is gonna be a little girls movie, about dolls and weird stuff. I thought it was gonna be a boring almost 2h movie about dolls, but oh boy was I wrong.not only was the theatre almost full on the third day of it airing, it was also: funny, inspiring, sad, and at times pretty confusing. It pretty much all felt like a fever dream, but in a good way. It also contained some jokes that were definitely for the adult/young-adult audience, but they were okay for teens like myself and the friend group i went with. Like, Barbie casually drops the word 'vagina' and Ken is talking about his genitals in a non-direct way, but the intention was still there. Some jokes landed pretty flat, but the big majority was very fun. Also the word 'patriarchy' was used way too many times by Ken (Ryan Gosling) and it felt almost annoying. The movie featured songs by the artists: Lizzo, Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish, Nicki Minaj and unfortunately Ice Spice. The soundtrack was absolutely incredible, maybe exept Ice Spice's song that was only heard at the credit roll, right at the end. We all know the movie was carried by the amazing Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, but I'd say Kate McKinnon's caracter and acting
In conclusion this is a pretty good movie, and if you have the opportunity you should watch it."
"The Barbie movie was overall highly enjoyable. The costumes and sets were great and added to the Barbie nostalgia. Ken was probably my favorite part, watching him go through the ups and downs of unrequited love, and finally finding himself outside of Barbie at the end of the movie. I even enjoyed the over-the-top portrayal of the patriarchy. It was hilarious. However, I felt the ending fell flat. Maybe they were trying to show how ridiculous the patriarchy was by putting in reverse, but I felt like they acted too dismissive of the plight of the Kens, to the point that it didn't feel satirical but rather like actually not acknowledging them and their voice at all. It felt like in giving women power and a voice they ended up actually mistreating the Kens and laughing it off as funny. Sure, they gave them some minor administrative role at the end, but the attitude when they did it was just so very wrong. Like it ended with the Barbies doing exactly what we complain about men in society doing to women. Not that it happened in the middle as part of their growth. It happened as part of the finale. The final focus of the film. Overall, I highly enjoyed the movie, but the ending really made me leave feeling let down."
"What could have been a cute concept was overproduced with obvious writer infighting pulling this disaster into all directions. A little girl friendly opening act quickly dissolves into act two social discussion that would leave any little girl bewildered. The family next to us described their three little ones as totally confused and everyone they heard discussing it was very disappointed with this disaster caused by feuding writers or a director who scored hilarious with ""Good Boys"". So, not for kids, and parents should wait for home viewing so they can turn it off when it wears really thin about a half hour in: the time it is realized its just not going to get any better and you turn it off thankful you didn't waste any money."
"This movie was such a fun watch, the comedy (especially by Ryan Gosling) carried the film for me. However the deeper meaning of the movie wasn't lost either.Pros: comedy, production/costume, dialogue, acting, casting, the use of Barbie merchandise, culture and nostalgia, music and dancing, cinematographyCons: some parts were stretched, the ending could've been delivered better, Will Ferrell was a good addition but it was also not needed, the seriousness of the movie got lost in the comedy at some points where you weren't sure how to feel.Overall, I think this movie was a fun watch and I'd probably watch it again."
"There are a lot of mixed reviews about this film and I really do not understand the point the people that do not like it are making. Nowadays I feel like we are too insensitive to what actually is happening in the world around us. I've read reviews stating that this movie is too heavy-handed and trying to be feminist and political. And yet Oppenheimer got more reviews and stars despite it being 100% political. It's like the world is doing exactly what the Barbie movie tells is happening. There is a serious divide in the way people approach feminism and it is honestly really sad that people think that this movie is ""Pitting men against women"" and vice-versa. Although I do not agree with the ending statement of the movie, ""And the Kens one day will achieve as much power in the Barbie land as women hold in the real world"", but in the end Barbie land is really just a reflection of the real world, just opposite, in order to open people's eyes to the fact that yes, women are discriminated against still and that they do not hold much power and autonomy in our world even today."
"The film's marketing portrayed it as a story about a doll entering the real world, but it surprisingly delves deeper into themes of feminism and patriarchy that were not adequately highlighted in the trailers. Had I not accidentally stumbled upon some spoilers before seeing the film, I would have been taken aback, expecting a more lighthearted and joyful adventure.Instead, ""Barbie"" turned out to be a story that explores the value of women and their place in society. While the central idea is commendable, the execution fell somewhat short for me. The plot became predictable once the main theme was revealed, and I could foresee the unfolding events and the movie's conclusion.Undoubtedly, the movie's core message is strong, but I couldn't fully embrace its realization. I agree with the critics' observations regarding the one-dimensional portrayal of male characters and the lack of true equality in the ending, despite the intentions.Still, ""Barbie"" has several strengths. The visual style is captivating, and the beauty of Barbieland is truly enchanting. In addition, the actors deliver commendable performances that add depth to their characters.On the downside, some of the characters who are not dolls themselves seem a bit too childish in their behavior, which detracts from the overall balance. Also, the treatment of the Kens raised some concerns and left room for improvement.In conclusion, ""Barbie"" tackles an important and relevant issue, but it could have been executed more effectively. Despite its shortcomings, the movie manages to leave an emotional impact thanks to its captivating visuals and strong performances."
"Barbie directed by Greta Gerwig introduces us to Stereotypical Barbie played by Margot Robbie having yet another perfect day in Barbieland an utopia where all its inhabitants are dolls, living in their pink dreamhouses with no exterior walls. Each day in Barbieland is a perfect day. However one day Barbie shows signs of being a human and is asked to go to Barbieland to figure out who's playing with her and fix everything. Along the way she discovers the joys and perils of living amongst humans and where she's truly meant to be.In this day and age when a lot of the movies rely on being ultra realistic and dark Barbie comes off as a surprise. It's escapism from reality and lots of entertainment is what audiences are craving right now. Barbie is such a fun and gorgeous movie that is filled with humour, heart, emotions and a lot of good messages. The production design and costumes are fantastic to look at and are absolute eye candies. The story is about self discovery and the evaluation of life however some might be caught off guard with the risks that Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach take with thier storytelling and social commentary.Speaking of the performances, Margot Robbie is perfect as Stereotypical Barbie but its Ryan Gosling's Ken that shines the most. He provides most of the comedic relief and is absolutely hilarious. The rest of cast does a pretty good job. Plus the monologue given by America Ferrera is something that everybody should listen to. It's so touching and talks about the challenges a woman has to go through in the society.Overall Barbie is a vibrant, bold and delightful movie that is fuelled by its star studded cast and flawlessly incorporated humour and though some of the creative choices might not always stick the landing, the good stuff largely overpowers the bad ones to create an immersive experience for the audience. Greta Gerwig has done it yet again."
"7.5/10
First of all, I really loved this movie. I think it's fun and entertaining and I really think it's done with a lot a passion for the original material. The references are clever and I couldn't help but smile each time I saw a Barbie I had as a child (specially Midge!! I loved her). It's a very colorful movie and it's so refreshing to see that, specially with all the ""gray"" movies we get nowadays. The characters in Barbie land are fun and innocent, it really captures the joy of a child playing with the dolls even in the way it's filmed, the way the characters and objects move and even the houses are just like the ones you could play with as a child. Plus I really loved Ken and I think Ryan Gosling did a great job, he was hilarious. The Kens shenanigans were the best parts of the movie for me.However this movie could have been an almost perfect movie if it wasn't for the real world parts and the messaging at the end of the movie.First of all, the real world is extremely exaggerated and they were really pushing the political view they had in this part.The scene where a man simply smacks Barbie out of nowhere is very unnecessary and it ruins the beautiful parts were Barbie is trying to feel and understand the real world around her like with the old lady at the bus stop (that part is just perfect and captures the essence of the real and beautiful complexity of real world feelings). More so, the parts with the mother and the teenage daughter could have been way better and I really didn't like them coming to the Barbie world. The ""deprogramming all the barbies"" was too forced for me and I would prefer if Barbie herself did that.Which leads me to the final part, the politics.After seeing the real world 'patriarchy"", Ken, a character that lived his whole life just to please Barbie and is nothing more than an accessory to her, finally feels appreciated for the first time in his life and brings the patriarchy to his own world because of that. Is he right? No, of course not. But I think it was actually a logical thing for him to do in that moment. And, for me, the movie was going to acknowledge that at the end. But it didn't. I mean, it did a little bit, but not enough in my opinion. It would have been awesome if the Barbies and kens came together at the end and decided to create a better society for both of them. But instead they chose to make a joke that ""the Kens will someday have just as much power as the women in the real world..."" It really missed the point of making Barbie land and lost the opportunity to make an inspiring example for the real world, one that helps the oppressed and makes equal opportunities for both men and women.Anyway, this my review of the movie and in conclusion: Close Kenough to a perfect movie."
"I didn't have a lot of big expectations for this movie, so imagine how happy and surprised I was about how much I enjoyed it! It's silly, and fun and then BOOM- existentialism! While I wouldn't recommend this movie for under 10- there's A LOT of innuendo that will probably go over many younger viewers heads, but there are a couple parts that might not be best for the littles, IMO. The soundtrack is amazing and the story is a lot deeper than one would expect! Margot Robbie is a delight, as is Ryan Gosling. The entire cast is wonderful! Issa Rae never disappoints and her role as President Barbie! A truly fun summer movie!"
"Barbie was certainly unique. It has a simple plot which well fits its target youth audience, it does have moments of comedy but don't expect any other sorts of genres. Both Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie give a good performance which is convincing at times but not always. Greta Gerwig sometimes shows reasonably interesting and unique cinematography however most of the shots and music are predictable. This movie was packed with a star studded cast which lives it up to a greater name than it deserves. If you have young children they will certainly enjoy it, but if not I wouldn't recommend it to you."
"Barbie will be a pioneer and a classic in the film world. She shatters all expectations and supersedes all standards. She is incredibly insightful, touching, truthful, whimsical. Barbie is made by women for women. To any man who ""doesn't get it"", you wont, but I invite you to watch it anyways as a show of support to women and our lived experiences and our dreams and hopes.To the men who feel attacked by this film, please feel attacked. This is an attack on men and rightfully so. Barbie doesn't stretch the truth or make a mockery, she puts life on the screen exactly how it is. Barbie is a mirror.And once again to the men who feel like ""this isn't for me"". If you are a heterosexual male attracted to women, the logical conclusion is to celebrate and enjoy femininity, to express curiosity, care and interest for women. A film that centres around women should immediately take your interest!To all the women reading this review, if you haven't seen the film yet, please indulge yourselves and do so. I hope you find joy, peace and love in all moments of your life x."
"Up to 80% of the storyline the film was great and tapped into essential topics of personal development and gender identities, reflecting and criticising society. The cast and characters had flair in the right amount of depth and dimensionality as well as chemistry amongst them. Also great that by the time the choreographed dancing scene(s) came in, the viewer had gotten the chance to properly care about what had been building up and then, the songs had real impact. It made for some good fun and laughs.As for the remaining 20%, it felt the makers did not know how to tie everything up and went for a shallow symbolic move which was very blurry and loose."
"Just as they did with White Noise (based on a phenomenal book by Don DeLillo, btw), Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach take an existing cultural institution which already possesses immense iconic satirical qualities and overwhelmly trash it with unnecessary hokey jokey business. (See the final supermarket so-called dance scene in White noise - itself lifted from a far better version in the final scene of the Japanese remake of Zatoichi). This couple should run a torture garden for a spy agency: they have such an immense grasp of the obvious, they will pummel your senses to smithereens. You will never recall when the Jokers grin of insane happiness was not permanently distorting your lips. What have we done to deserve this? You name it. At least they didn't cast Adam Driver as Ken."
"Laugh out loud humor, fantastic sets and costumes that contain a wonderful message. I took my teenage daughter and preteen son and we all were incredibly surprised by exactly how much we enjoyed the entire film. I was not sure what to expect but it exceeded anything I could have imagined. While there was an inherently difficult topic at the core, it was handled delicately and with care. Lots of hilarity for the adults but minimal issues that would create discomfort if you take younger kids. My kids have already said they want to watch it again. So do I because I think I will find deeper concepts on a 2nd watch. And the music was phenomenal!"
"I went into this film opening day for a good laugh not expecting too much from it. When I exited the theatre I was shocked by how good of a film it was. I didn't expect it to be so funny, so we'll written, I just thought it would be okay and a bit cheesy but no. Truly a great film but there are a few jokes that might go over young kids heads, as well as some of the references. One of the most fun films of the year to experience, especially if you are depressed after watching 'Oppenheimer'. It has moments of sadness, laughs and so much more. Overall 10/10, great message, great acting, great movie."
"I saw this movie in theatres, and I found it kind of underwhelming. Each and every act of the film feels so different and disconnected from the other, and by the end it feels like the plot looses traction. But that doesn't mean I thought the movie was bad, I thought it was funny and charming all throughout, but I guess my issue is that I'm in the wrong demographic. Near the beginning and near the end, there's a strong theme of motherhood and the troubles of being a woman, and as a man, I can't relate. As a result, I had a hard time relating to a lot of this movies big plot points and emotional moments. And on top of that, halfway though it becomes exceedingly boring. But overall, I'd say it's a solid 7/10."
"This movie was an absolute hoot at my screening! A week after it's release, my theater was packed with people, laughing and clapping throughout the whole film. It was a great experience, and I really enjoyed the movie. Michael Cera was probably my favorite actor along with Ryan gosling and surprisingly Kate McKinnon. The story and adventure was really fun, I was absolutely in love with the visuals throughout the film, and I thought the self awareness was really refreshing. The music also energized the film throughout. With all that being said, I did have two complaints. The first is that the conclusion of the movie is that men and women can't work together, and I think that was a really strange choice. I understand that the movie wanted to empower independence but collaboration is also very important. Second complaint, why the heck was there a Chevrolet commercial in the middle of the movie? Anyways loved the movie and can't wait to see what Greta Gerwig does next."
"7.5/10: VERY GOODThis movie is very strange, but also very fun, it is well crafted, well acted and the humour is amazing. But where this movie fails is when it tries to make itself seem like a very important movie (in some parts) when the overall tone is light-hearted comedy. The scenes when it is trying to prove that also seem overlong. But, those scenes are funny, as is the rest of the film. I also enjoyed the direction it took with this not really being a children's film.Overall, i really enjoyed this movie, it has great humour, and great performances, but some scenes go on for too long. A very good and funny film."
It's nice to have a movie that's fun and interesting dialogue. I knew the style of the movie by the scenes I'd seen leaked online I think that in itself is not everyone's style but boy it's unique and very barbieland. A lot of thought went into this and it's not just for women it's for anybody. We all need an Allan in our life. I could've used more boardroom ceo scenes with will farrel and his men tho. It's lovely to see the perspective of both men and women and at the end of the day what I got from this movie is about how we're each wanting to find our happiness and who we are outside of someone else.
"I have many opinions when it comes to this movie. The movie itself was great, but as everything in life nothing is perfect.Why a 7 out of 10? You may ask yourself, well even though the movie was great produced, had a great casting, great costumes and of course an impressive set, the plot was weak. The fact that Barbie (Margot Robbie) did not last even five minutes in the Real World disappointed me. I know that she was supposed to find Gloria (America Ferrera) to get ""fixed"", so she could go home and be the stereotypical barbie again, which in fact was the main plot of the movie, at first. However, she finds her real fast, not giving Barbie enough time to get to know the Real World, aside from the disrespectful male individuals in the beginning. I would have liked Barbie to experience the Real World in a different way, even though the Real World is messed up. I think it would have been nice for Barbie to eat an ice cream for the first time that was not made of plastic or simply for Ken to feel the water at the beach and realize it was not made of plastic or foam as well.Another thing that I did not like was that some characters from Barbie Dreamhouse were not in the movie, such as Ryan, Raquelle, and Nikki, but it was better like that because we all know Raquelle and her unexplainable need to be more successful than barbie at everything. Although at some points I wonder what would have been like if Raquelle were in the movie and totally interfered with Barbie's plan of getting fixed in the Real World.Let us talk about Ken (Ryan Gosling) for a minute. I must say that, at first, I found Ryan Gosling unfit for the Ken role, but I am completely happy with the way he portrayed his character. He made me laugh so much with his facial expressions and his speeches. I went to watch the movie for Barbie and ended up in love with Ken's character. However, Ken might have been funny, but when he totally invaded Barbie's house and threw her clothes away, I found it mean and disrespectful. Yet we have never thought about the Kens for a second, like where do they go when the Barbies go to sleep.I feel like they took this movie as a huge Mattel propaganda, instead of what it should have been. A fun movie where Barbie ventures into an unknow world for the first time trying to get her ""problems"" fixed but having to bear with Ken throughout the whole trip; like those comedy movies where a duo must stick together through a difficult situation even though they do not entirely love each other's personality.At last, I loved how Barbie did not need a man to be happy or complete and I also loved how Ken realized that he didn't need Barbie for him to be Kenough. Not like in Dreamhouse where Ken is always so clingy and needy of Barbie just because. Like Barbie don't need no man to be Barbie. I also loved Allan and his awkwardness, so sad that they discontinued him and Midge. I would have liked to see Ken and Allan as buddies, after all that's why Allan was created, to be Ken's buddy, although I don't think they would have clicked.Margot did an amazing job as Barbie and so did Ryan as Ken. I love them both and loved their acting in this as well, I truly enjoyed the movie expect the little things mentioned previously."
"Come on Barbie, let's go smash the patriarchy!Greta Gerwig is the freaking best!! Looking at all the one/two stars reviews written by obviously male audience (or males who haven't watched it, just wanna express their fragile and insecure masculinity) makes this film even more ironic and a mirror of our society. Brava, Gerwig!Must take your boyfriends, straight male friends, brothers to watch this film, a good way to educate them or you know, get the hell out of the relationship while you still can.It's not just a simple film anymore, it's a sensational experience, a work of new generation. Maybe it's not perfect, but we need this, the society need this, the straight white male dominated Hollywood absolutely need this."
"6 only for the jokes, the movie Is really stupid, not for Kids and not Easy undestand with dialogs
Puts a lot of thing together Just to seems fair in gender equality in the worst way that you can Imagine.You can seen the movie and find It funny, it's ok, because without that there'll not be a movie
Nothing to tell
Something old to compare to today's Life
Will Farrell more idioti then ever
America Ferrera daughter uselles speach about fascism, capitalism and uselles the history
America Ferrera idea of a new And already seenIs a brunch of nothing out together, nothing to Remember instead of the funny jokes."
"Underneath the corporate irony and plate-spinning, there's a film that is mildly humorous; if not a tad lost with it's identity and message. A battle between feminism and stereotyping. Is this a film for young girls? I don't know, it feels as if it's wondered off the reservation. Is it a film for women - more than likely. There's heartfelt messaging at the curtain closing, but it very much straddles the fence between traditional conservative womanhood and progressive girl boss ""smash the patriarchy"".Speaking of patriarchy, this film drops the p-word countless times. And the image of masculinity is confusing, is Ken masculine or campy and confused? Horse obsessed, gym bro, with a passion for theatrics and fur coats - traditional masculine, doubtful.I don't know who this film was made for, or where it stands on anything. The safe corporate mediocre middle ground is where this film stakes it's claim for your attention and money.Enjoy it by all means, if you can straighten out it's allegorical message, then please let me know."
"This was perfectly cast. I mean Ryan Gosling as Ken (I just can not picture anyone else doing it that well). Margot Robbie is absolute perfection and Michael Cera's ""Allan"" is just hilarious. Not to mention the rest of the cast. It was surprisingly very touching, poignant, and extremely nostalgic. I mean they got everything perfect. Every touch of the playhouses, the outfits. I loved that the entire audience went dressed in pink. The little girl in me was *screaming*. Loved every single part of it. The Kens revolution and dance sequence are just so creative. I would watch this over and over. So thoughtful."
"First, lower your expectations and second, this is not a children's movie. Lastly, don't take it seriously.Go in with those three things in mind and if you have any sense of humor, you will really enjoy this film.It's honestly really dumb fun, along the lines of Anchorman or Talladega Nights. No, it's probably not as good as either of those, but is along the same comedic line and it is really funny and charming.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are both hysterical and do a great job in the movie. The entire theater laughed out loud through most of the movie. The supporting cast was spot on as well.There was a ton of reminiscing happening in the theater. You could hear countless women whispering ""I had that play set!"" Or ""I had that Barbie outfit."" That made the movie more enjoyable for many.Overall the movie was really good. In my opinion, the only misses were, every man in the movie was over the top stupid. No reason for that. And I believed the ending should have gone in a different direction, but I won't spoil it with my opinion."
"I loved the laughs that I got out of this movie! Being able to make fun of yourself makes life so much better! The movie was very meta and definitely knew what it was doing. The feel did give slight first season of the office vibes every now and then, but it hit the message home! The main actors In Barbie and Ken were exactly what the movie needed. Will Ferrell showing up was kinda weird not gonna lie, but he did fit into his ""bumbling idiot in charge of everything"" role perfectly. I would also love to see other men step up and say they enjoyed this movie. It was like sitting through a good roast. We should also listen to the true message, and make way for a more equal world. Even for the stereotypical Barbie's, the weird Barbie's, and every Barbie in between. On to Oppenheimer!"
"I absolutely LOVED this movie! It was everything I could have ever wanted it to be and THEN SOME! Fun, empowering, intelligent, socially relevant, deeply moving and by far the pinkest movie l've ever seen! An all around an amazing experience and there's something in it for everyone! All genders, all ages, everyone can appreciate it. The entire audience seemed to have a blast throughout the movie. Everyone was laughing during the funny bits(and there were A LOT of them) and during the heartfelt, more emotional moments you could feel the energy shift and the messages the movie was trying to convey really being taken in. Amazing cast, excellent cinematography, fantastic soundtrack, you definitely want to see this one!"
"This movie has an absurdist quality about it that I can't really explain, almost like early 2000's Ben Stiller movies like Zoolander or Tropic Thunder, that makes you feel as if you hallucinated the whole thing. In that regard, another comparison is Monty Python's flying circus and the sort of delightful wittiness of the show.Barbie is profoundly silly and strange and an extremely high effort production, reflected in the spectacular set design. Ryan Gosling is absolutely perfect for the role so much that he steals the show. The result is that Barbie is almost completely unlike anything else you would see at the cinemas.I don' t think the film is perfect or anything, the ending, for me, felt a bit unsatisfying for Ken, at least, and the film also contains a car commercial, for some reason. At the end of the day, even if you disagree or have problems with the feminist argument that the film makes, the film will have you smiling like an idiot most of the time in a way that not many other pieces of media can."
"I read from many sources about Barbie being a hardcore feminist movie, just as bad as all recent Lucasfilm sludge. I'm happy to report it is not true.Barbie and Ken have their separate, but equal story arcs. Ken goes on adventure of self discovery and ultimately learns his value outside just being there just for Barbie.Barbie's part of the story lingers a lot on the paradox that she is meant to be an icon of emancipation, but is also blamed for setting the wrong standards and gets some hate for it.There are also real human characters, which are compelling at first, but rather simplistic.The storytelling frequently stops to explore and explain too many messages about society, equality, misogyny and troubles if growing up and being a woman or a mother.The writing has some problems, bad jokes and the last twelve minutes are utterly pointless. But overall it delivered what it promised in a very nice package.The sets and cinematography are top notch, as well as the acting."
"As the film's trailer suggests, whether you like or dislike Barbie dolls and merchandise, there's still plenty of things to enjoy about Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie."" Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are brilliantly cast as Barbie and Ken where they both have awesome chemistry and share plenty of hilarious moments on-screen. I should also add that Gosling delivers what's probably one of the best musical solos of the year next to Jack Black's performance in The Super Mario Bros Movie.""Barbie"" is not only an eccentric, goofball comedy but also a thought-provoking film with a post-feminist take on gender roles and gender stereotypes in current society, something highly reminiscent of movies such as ""The Ugly Truth"" or ""Down With Love."" On that note, America Ferrera's powerful monologue near the end of ""Barbie"" was on par with Renée Zellweger's speech in ""Down With Love.""While the above description might make it sound like the Barbie movie leans too much into polemics for it to be good escapist fun then don't worry, because aside from its core message, it's still oodles of light-hearted, hilarious entertainment for everyone to enjoy from beginning to end."
"I loved the set design, acting and personal development of the characters, the nuance and meaning, but didn't like the rushed storyline. Production obviously invested a great deal in the set design, barbie dream houses, and wardrobes. It was pink everything with blue ""beach"", with a plastic vibe. It was cool how they incorporated the Barbie box and different outfits, something I loved as a child. I also thought TV Barbie was a blast from the past (90s baby here), and learned about other dolls like Midge, Skipper, and Alan. Also... they didn't do poor Midge any justice. She was played by a terrific actress, so there was definitely a storyline missed with her character. I thought Alan was played very well though.I thought that Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling played their characters perfectly, capturing their characters development and different nuances. You could definitely see Barbies transformation into a human, but Margot did a good job at keeping Barbie at her core even in human form.Some of my favorite storylines included the war of the Kens, the discovery of patriarchy, the brainwashing of the Barbies, and the takeover of the Barbies - again.However, the switch to the real world and back felt rushed, as well as the relationship development between Sasha and Gloria, and Barbie. Really what should have happened was a two part movie, to fully tell the story, or a 3 hour movie. I also felt they spent too much time in Barbie world in the beginning and felt myself getting bored.For example, Sasha and Gloria meet Barbie and after one scene believe that she is a doll and follow her back to Barbie world. I felt like Barbie should have had to work to make them believe her, making the discovery of Barbie world by Sasha and Gloria even sweeter, and Barbie's transformation into human even more complex. I wish I got to see her learn more about becoming human. I absolutely loved the gynecologist scene at the end, but felt that could have been earlier in the movie, with the scene with Ruth at the end.I couldn't discern if this movie was just a comedy or trying to be serious, with all the complex nuance surrounding feminism. It could have easily been both if there was more time spent on Barbie's transformation to human. Maybe a second movie could have been about her going back to Barbie world in human form to save her girls and restore the proper control to Barbie."
"Barbie had to carry the weight of everyone's expectations (just what the movie is talking about), and people are disappointed because they expected barbie movie to be amazing, perfect and everything in between. The barbie topic, no matter how superficial it may seem, is not easy to grasp and hard to portray. I think Greta did an amazing job, both Margot and Ryan played their part so well, and speech from America made me cry with few tears, all that was said is what all women feel. Billie's song was cherry on top. An 8 on surface since I thought to myself - why would they include such badly executed cgi, and a 10, because um, it's barbie, it's barbie land... it isn't real life, and men should be glad that it's not."
"The social commentary was pretty heavy-handed. Albeit, this is to be expected in the Barbie movie. However, it was genuinely funny. A lot of creativity and imagination went into this movie which ads to the charm. There were tons of little details that could make this a movie great to own and watch more than once. Plot was a cute but could have been smarter. Its nice to see a new movie that isn't just a remake or a sequel but I fully expect to see a franchise for this. I appreciated the few times that they seemingly poked fun at feminism. In one the of the final scenes, the creator of barbie character said that the patriarchy was something that was made up to deal with how the world is."
"I loved the effort with the sets and the fun outfits. I also really enjoyed the ads threw out movie.I was really enjoying this movie but then it started getting really political, I was kind of fine with it but then they started making politics the whole story line and so it was really no longer a fun movie. After the movie finished I just ended up leaving miserable and like I waisted money... How is a family meant to enjoy this?? I can't see any 13 year old understanding anything they talk about.Also they want to talk about how being a human is hard and that were not perfect but then they hire someone to play a teen girl who has perfect hair and skin. A bit of a confusing message?"
"Entering the cinema with the expectation of a colorful and girly adventure, I was surprised to find that this movie delved into deeper societal issues, transcending its supposed joyful facade. It skillfully addressed complex topics within a simple narrative, which captivated me. Despite its innocent appearance, the film was profoundly moving, evoking feelings of sadness, frustration, and anger. Watching it led me to embrace feminism but acknowledge that men also face their own issues. The movie's creator intended to shed light on the intricacies of being a woman, and the portrayal of Ken feeling left out highlights one of the many challenges women encounter daily in the real world. It made me realize how our society has always been so misogynistically setup."
"Storyline: 8.5- Great story, could've been fleshed out in some areas to have even more overall connection, but it makes overall sense. A little silly at times; but I'm not complaining, I mean it is a story about Barbie. Pacing was good and easy to follow. It is, in my opinion, the perfect movie length, at an hour and 54 minutes.Cinematography: 8.75- There are some really great cinematic shots throughout the film. Very clear distinction between ""Barbie Land"" and ""The Real World"".Acting- 9.75- The acting was wonderful. Every actor pulled their weight and shined. Many comedic moments that will have you laughing nearly to tears. Also, There are serious moments that are executed well in such a way that may even bring you to tears (as they did to me).Music Music Soundtrack: 9.5- Overall, extremely strong movie music soundtrack. All of the songs align with the theme of what is happening during the current scenes & the storyline. Great modern day popular artists chosen, including Lizzo, Dua Lippa, Nicki Minaj, Ice Spice, Sam Smith, Tame Impala, and others. The weakest song (and I mean from a vocal standpoint) is the one sung by Ryan Gosling.Choreography- 9- There is a fair amount of choreography in the film, and there is an all-Ken dancing scene that is phenomenal.Overall: 9.1/10."
"Funny thing to say about a Barbie movie, means I had my hopes too up, but it's more about who directed it, I think she's pretty good.What worked for me was the barbie world, and Margot and especially Ryan were great. Every scene with Ryan was great, he's got great comedic timing.What didn't work was the real world. The real people are supposed to come and teach the dolls what real life is like, but they do it with the most cliche, cringiest dialogue (I would call it womansplaining honestly, stuff that will make everyone cringe in like 10 years - but hey, it's a Barbie movie in 2023, what can you expect).The issue really is that the real people (the mother and daughter and the Mattel people and even people on the streets) were just not believable as real people. So if you're not going to show believable characters, you may as well just show me the dolls and remove the real world all together.Overall pretty funny, worth a watch, but it has much less depth than I imagined from the trailers. In the end it's just a huge product placement, when it could've been more. But hey, just imagine how them profits will skyrocket."
"Well, English is not my first language so I'll try my best here.With the complete deconstruction of the concept of ""Barbie"", Gerwig subverted every stereotype you've associated with this ""not-so-feminist"" toy. She took an innovative approach to story-telling, struck a balance between flamboyant shots and down-to-earth narrative. Behind every joke there is a harsh reality. It's light-hearted yet solemn, comprehensible yet arduous, optimistic yet depressing. For I know this world is not gonna be as acceptable as the movie wants it to be. Just look at these 1/10 reviews here. I hope Gerwig will make more movies like Barbie because I need it, we need it."
"Barbie is a film that stands out in many aspects, from its comedic moments to its unique charm. The world it presents is filled with vibrant colors, whimsical settings, lively music, and a sense of fantasy and extravagance. Visually speaking, the film is truly unmatched. The actors delivered commendable performances, with special applause going to Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. However, I must admit that I personally enjoyed the scenes included in the trailer more than some of the other parts of the film. They struck me as particularly funny.Where the story loses points is in its confusing message. While the film clearly aims to promote gender equality, the way it delivers this message suggests a certain superiority of the female gender. Some of the dialogue felt forced and unrealistic within the narrative. It wasn't so much the fact that the pep talks were about women, but rather the way they were integrated into the story. I want to clarify that my criticisms are not driven by bigotry or sexism. As a woman myself, I appreciate the intention but felt it could have been handled more subtly.I found it disappointing that many of the characters in the film, such as Alan and several of the Barbies/Kens, lacked relevance and development or were straight up stereotypes. Additionally, I would have liked to see more exploration of Barbie Land and its unique characteristics. On a positive note, the message about the transient nature of one's life in comparison to the enduring power of an idea was sweet and exciting."
"You don't know what to expect before watching Barbie, and I can assure you it met my expectations and exceeded them!I really recommend you watching it! Such a great work behind and such a great movie. It touches topics among feminism, the patriarchy and how hard and difficult it's to be a woman.The actors did amazing and Greta did such a great job with this movie, it's what we all need and wanted.Also shoutout to the music from the movie and the amazing songs that the artists have created for it. I totally recommended it! I watched it some days ago and can't wait to go watch it again!!!!!"
"This plot of Barbie unexpected, I watched it with no real expectations and no other knowledge about what it would be like. Barbie took me by surprise at it had a super deep and meaningful plot on being a woman, what the barbie life is like vs what it actually is like to be a woman. Plus the ken parts were super hilarious, the whole cinema was falling out of our seats at Ryan Gosling, he played Ken so well. And it was great to have these funny moments through out, when some of the parts were more serious. But I wish it had more barbie references, maybe from the movies which is such a memory for me growing up, but it seemed to focus more on Barbies with jobs trying to show that Girls can grow up to do anything, but I guess they couldn't cater to everything as it might've been to hard to squeeze it all it.But other than that this movie was enjoyable, maybe not one of my favourites and I might not watch it again, but seeing it in the cinema was such a great atmosphere and it was fun to see everyone dress up and have fun and laugh together! <3."
"First 10mins was annoying, then it came around as it showed us it was self-aware enough to realise. Over and hour in i was enjoying it. The comedy is on point all round. Then came the part when the women plot to lie and ""cheat"" on their boyfriends at the beach...
That was a bit evil?. Im sure a lot of kids went to see this film and teens. The cinema i was in was sure packed but that wasnt a good message. ""To save barbieland we must lie and cheat on our boyfriends"" not sure a lot of parents would like that message either. Then the film wraps up wonderfully about barbie becoming human and herself instead of playing the role of barbie which was wonderful.. But are we supposed to just pretend and forget the message of this film just five minutes ago is to cheat on your boyrfriends and lie to them once youve gained their trust and made them happy? Hmm. Ryan gosling however was amazing to witness. Totally amazing just like he was in any other gosling film. Drive and blade runner being my favs.I will rewatch this because the comedy is very much on point but ill fast forward a lot of the extremist feminist speeches as they leave a questionable aftertaste when examined. I cannot give this film a 10 even though you can tell the production budget is amazing as were the acting. Go and see it if you have the itch. But it's not for everyone."
"I would probably feel more positive about the film if it hadn't been hyped up so much in the marketing and press junkets.The first half of the film is essentially the trailer and the second half doesn't deliver anything profound. I was disappointed the conversation on femininity and what it means to be a woman didn't develop past what is already in pop culture. Yes we know there are high standards for beauty.The second half of the film becomes a mess, with the meaning that they'd set up in the first part of the film falling apart. The scene dedicated to breaking up with Ken was plain confusing to me, the part where she becomes a human even more so and then the gynaecologist appointment ugh. I probably needed to have a very different sense of humour to watch this film (despite the fact I find Ryan Gosling hilarious in other things)I got the to the end thinking ""is that it?"""
"This movie was worth going to the theater I thought it was a good idea and there ware some really good jokes haw ever there are a few holes in the story and I feel like Barbie's personality was very empty I know that that is kind of how it's supposed to be because Barbie is a dal but for me I need to have a memorable mane characters. A other thing I liked about the movie was the opening scene lats just say it MIGHT BE
Really FUNNY. There were a lot of scenes in this were the hole theater was lagging so loud l couldn't hear a thing. I also never played with barbies so I didn't get any of the references but yeah I think movie was decent."
"(Note: I highly recommend seeing both this film and Oppenheimer as a double feature. Both are heavy handed films that have characters going through an existential crisis and are consumed with thoughts of death. You would think these two films have nothing in common, but I'm dead serious - no pun intended.)When your film has your narrator saying the word ""feminism"" in the first five minutes, you know it's going to be problematic.Now, don't get me wrong. I have no problem with feminism and I consider myself a feminist. Some of my favorite films have feminist characters. I knew going in this film was going to be woke. I just didn't realize how woke till I saw it, which was kind of a disappointment anyway.First off, don't let the cutesy pink marketing fool you. This is not a film for kids, but that happens quite a lot in Hollywood. For example, Drop Dead Fred was a film I saw when I was 10, but it was really for adults. But at least it wasn't woke. I felt kind of sorry for the little girls I saw wearing their pretty pink outfits and dresses knowing that probably much of the preaching against the patriarchy and lack of genitalia jokes were going to go over their heads.Yep. I said what I said. It only gets worse from there.Margot Robbie plays the titular Barbie who lives in Barbieland with all her fellow Barbies that can do it all and have it all. The Kens are kind of just...there. The main Ken played by Ryan Gosling, gets tired of being from friend zoned and taken for granted by Barbie. When Barbie starts to have thoughts of her own mortality, has flat feet, and cellulite, she is advised by Kate McKinnon (one of the few bright spots in the film as Weird Barbie) to go to the Real World to find the girl who's playing with her and make everything right. Ken decides to stow away in Barbie's pink Corvette. Both of them discover the Real World is not what it seems.My biggest problem with this film was the constant preachiness, especially when Barbie and Ken go to the Real World, and it never really stops from there. I resented Greta Gerwig for ""giving the game away"". There's a way to talk about feminism without hammering it over the head and alienating half your audience, in this case men, but I doubt many men will see it. It's like that South Park episode when Randy makes a musical that explicitly talks about oral sex until he is advised to tone it down and hide the message in subtext. That's what Gerwig and her partner Noah Baumbach should have done with the story. This is a film that definitely skews toward a female audience. It needed to be more subtle with the messaging. I would have preferred a fun, silly, colorful Barbie film rather than having a woke agenda pushed on me. Unfortunately, that's the direction Hollywood seems to have embraced these days.However, the visuals were bright, fun, and colorful along with the hairstyles and wardrobe. I liked that they filmed in the Venice Beach Boardwalk and other areas around LA. Despite the diversity of the cast, my mom was unhappy that she didn't see a Hispanic Barbie and Ken (even though we saw a white, black, and Asian Ken). If there were any in the cast, I didn't see them. America Ferreira and her daughter are indeed Latina, but that wasn't enough for her. She does have a point, though, but we could be wrong and missed them. Will Ferrell is wasted as the CEO of Mattel, but I don't care for him anyway, so it didn't really matter that I didn't see him much. Rhea Perlman did have a nice little part as the creator of Barbie, Ruth Handler.This film was very strange and I felt kind of alienated by it. Plus, the last scene of the film was anticlimactic and totally bizarre. I get the good intentions by the filmmakers, but it was way too preachy for me. Legally Blonde was the closest to a Barbie film up until this point and it was a feminist film that never felt like it was preaching to its audience. Elle Woods was a blonde Barbie type character who was underestimated because of her looks, but manages to showcase her intelligence and strength as a successful lawyer without the message of the story becoming too heavy handed and retaining the lighthearted playfulness throughout, which is what Barbie is missing. I think I'll just stick to that film instead."
"Truthfully, after seeing this film once, I did not realize just how many gems there are in it. Everything in the movie is representative of something else. It is more than just literal. For eg. Barbie was not into Ken as we are accustomed to because her owner did not have a Ken doll. The adding on of the character Ruth gave so much life to this movie. This one was definitely dedicated to women. As a girl, if you haven't seen it, I would recommend you go as soon as you can. It is especially empowering to young girls because it truly shows the essence of a woman. The trailer was not enough to capture the beauty of this movie. It was definitely more than what I expected. I completely understand why anyone would think that the men were portrayed as 'dumb' (obviously in the real world, men aren't as bad as the movie makes it seem) but I think what was meant to come from this movie was a deeper message, and this may have been necessary to really capture what the movie was trying to portray for all women. It was needed to emphasize the movie so to speak."
"The surface-level: Barbie is vibrant, fun, and immensely enjoyable. Robbie and Gosling are stellar, and Gerwig's camera has never been in better focus.What I really want to talk about is the idea of perfection and that flaws are not deterrents; flaws are what make us who we are.Barbie is perfect. But what is perfection? Beauty? Endless dance parties? A world where everyone gets along? A world without worry? No; those are hollow. Perfection is an illusion. There is no happiness or self-worth in perfection. Perfection is a lie that hides the real joy of life.Owning who you are, finding joy with yourself, being brave enough to face the conflicts each rising sun brings, and combating the fear that you aren't good enough is where real, true experiences are found.Barbie is perfect, and she wants to maintain her perfection. But as her journey unfolds, she discovers something better-self-realization.Ken lacks agency, and Barbie cannot give that to Ken. He must find it himself. Barbie is about empowerment, discovery, and owning the person you are. No one defines you; you define you.Barbie and Ken's first experience in the real world is an all-too-expected scene. Unfortunately, the likely reaction to it from some will also be expected.Barbie is an object, something to obtain. Ken is a person, someone to converse with or admire. The difference in experience is drastic, and-sadly-one that will surely be looked over and taken at face value.The point of the scene is not ""it's hard to be a woman."" The point is that Ken is oblivious to the difference. He's so wrapped up in his own experience that he can't see Barbie's. He doesn't question why their experiences are different; he doesn't care. He just wants his experience to be enjoyable. He wants his life to be more, even at the expense of others.Too many will see it as surface level. And too many will refuse to dig deeper. Instead, they'll be content to be outraged or faux-offended. ""My life is hard too!"" they'll say. And that's the point. Her life is hard, his life is hard, everyone's life is hard. Consideration is all it takes to better both.Barbie has a lot to say about agency and self-realization, and really, the film is quite meta in the best way."
"Opposite of my expectations, overall I thought this movie was entertaining and pretty funny. Ryan Gosling was fantastic as Ken and the Ken's as a whole were really funny and my favorite part about the movie. The set design was knocked out of the park, it was the perfect look of Barbie land and it really immersed you in it. Lastly I thought the little details in the movie were awesome, like as if somebody was playing with Barbie like when she floats down from her house, the shower water is imaginary, and the drink she has at breakfast is imaginary. I love little details like that and Gerwig killed it with those.But just like everyone has been talking about, I'd like to talk about the ""message"" this movie is pushing. I overall didn't feel like they were straight ""man hating"", but there definitely were certain parts where you just roll your eyes but it didn't take away from the overall experience for me. The part where they go to the real world and every dude they encounter is a cat calling misogynistic a-hole was a bit much for me, I am obviously aware it happens in the real world but they exaggerated it quite a bit. Imagine you take your young daughter to see this, it's gonna make her think every dude she encounters going forward is an a hole growing up.The Characters of America Ferrera's daughter and the Mattel higher up's were absolutely worthless to the plot. I mean she is introduced to us by honestly being a b**** to Barbie spewing adult themed nonsense and then after that really has no growth and just is along for the ""diversion/twist"" that her mom is the one that needed Barbie's help.My main gripe with this movie is the plot of the last 30 minutes and the ending. Ken comes back from Earth with ""Patriarchal"" ideals and takes over Barbie land and I honestly couldn't tell if they were supposed to be the so on ""villains"" of the movie or if just it was a joking way to have a problem in the movie. Because I never really felt like they were bad guys, Ken was treated like crap by Barbie and so it makes it really hard to ever root against him. The end was just real clunky and stuff just happened so fast and got too serious too fast. It's like they did it just they could get a way to fit in that montage video to pull women's emotional strings.PSA: This is not a kids movie, definitely intended for young adults to middle aged women. Most of the humor in it is adult level humor.But overall I came into this movie thinking I would dread it but came out happy with my experience watching it."
"Expertly written, perfectly plastic visually, with a strong thematic mix of The Matrix and The Wizard of Oz. BUT! It very much made me think of late career comedy specials from George Carlin; not as fun as expected, but there are zero flaws in the logic of the message.So many little nuances that pull you into the well crafted universe bit by bit. The added touch of there being multiple Barbies and Ken's that are not differentiated by name was genius. It may make it somewhat difficult to discuss the slight differences between the characters, but so what?I just hope they don't make a sequel. I can't imagine how they could do that without it being a cheap cash grab, and that would be a shame for a movie with this kind of intellect."
"I'm only writing this due to the misperception of this movie. I saw the movie opening night with my GF who loved and still loves Barbie. She is stereotypical Barbie and she dressed up in pink and had a wonderful time. If you're a fan of Barbie you can stop reading here and just go see the movie you will love it.In fact if you are a fan of Barbie I suggest you stop reading this review and allow yourself to enjoy the fantasy and childhood nostalgia the movie will surely provide and avoid discussing the movie with anyone who wants to dissect it or take away from your feel good experience.However, for the people who are championing the movie as a feminist masterpiece or hating on it for its depiction of men, I would like to ask if you watched the same movie? Neither men nor women were the target in this movie. This movie was taking shots at beautiful and desirable people in general. It is established quite early on that the Barbie's and Kens live in a dreamland and falsely believe they have solved the worlds problems and live in blissful ignorance. As soon as this main charachters bliss is threatened, that becomes the problem that the movie focuses on needing to be solved. Even though many real world problems are addressed and pointed out (usually by people not good looking enough to live in barbieland), they are all ignored and left unresolved by the end of the movie, that is, aside from the inclusion of ""ordinary people"" by Mattels introduction of ""Ordinary Barbie"", which seems to serve as further evidence of Mattel claiming self awareness (hammered home by constant self deprecation while never actually crossing the line into actually being the antagonist of the film) and wanting to distance itself from their objectification of women by making Barbie in the first place. Finally Barbie did not get any character growth by becoming real, Mattel just placed her in a box and got her off the production line through manipulative means employed by the founder of Mattel - an old woman. (honestly ladies, this is your real enemy in life lol. Men are pretty useless as depicted, old women who hate you for being young and shitty men who cant have you are the ones who oppress you)The movie however seemed to say these things through mockery:
1- if you treat men like the Barbies treat the Kens, you will become one option of many, as made clear by being labelled low commitment casual girlfriends.2 - When your old (like Barbie) you have to leave barbyland and you will be immediately devalued by having to relinquish access to your vagina. HOWEVER even though Ken is old (and unbelievably dumb and useless) he still gets to live in Barby Dreamland and maintains access to all the young beautiful Barby's which just seems to reinforce the supposedly ""patriarchal"" concept of men maintaining value as partners far longer then women.3 - If you're young and pretty (for women) or just pretty (for men), you dont have any real problems and get to focus solely on easing any perceived blows to your extremely fragile emotional state while all the ugly people in the real world maintain order and functionality while dealing with ""real problems"".4 - There in fact is a special existence for people who are good looking enough to qualify and even though its not based in reality, as long as your good enough, you get to live in the perfect dreamland while ugly people live in reality.That being said, the movie is done very well and fun to watch and the casting is done well with all criticisms of the cast being too old, being proven wrong as their age was the actual focal point of the movie. Aside from America Ferrara. We do not like her as an audience lol. Superstore proved this. Her patronizing speech is an insult to women's intellects and the low point of the movie. Gosling's accidently but surprisingly meta self portrayal is probably the highlight. (I dont understand why men are upset by this, how Gosling was portrayed in this movie is exactly how I have seen him my entire life lol..).I'd rate Barby as Sublime."
"""Barbie"" may seem like an improbable concept for a thought-provoking film, but director Greta Gerwig skillfully harnesses this cultural icon to deliver a potent and profound message. Gerwig delicately weaves a narrative that explores the complexities of gender dynamics without vilifying either gender, demonstrating that Kens in Barbieland face similar challenges as real-world women. The film also touches on the importance of embracing diversity and dismantling societal barriers. The movie's production design deserves applause, staying true to the beloved Barbie toys while ingeniously utilizing their features to propel the story forward. Margot Robbie delivers a phenomenal performance as Barbie, injecting depth and nuance into a character often dismissed as one-dimensional. Ryan Gosling, as Ken, complements the film with his adept portrayal, enhancing the chemistry between the characters, while America Ferrera's character brings a layer of relatability to the story. Gerwig's clever balance of humor and poignancy ensures that the movie achieves its goal of raising awareness without alienating its audience. A delightful yet meaningful cinematic experience."
"This was definitely an entertaining movie but it went in so many different directions at times. Also, the product placement and clear control from Mattel takes you out of the fantasy at times. Honestly, it is unique and not something really done before, so it gets points for that. It's a lot though. Just a lot going on, and not all of what was going on was necessary.Also, Ryan Gosling is not the best singer or dancer. It was cheesy and over the top. I'm glad I saw it in theaters because if it was on a streaming service I'd probably turn it off as it was so weird. It's worth watching so you're in on the hype and pop culture reference this will surely become."
"Barbie was a great film. This movie is so well written and super clever. Makes you laugh, cry, and ponder what it means to live in today's world.This film has a message for us all and makes some excellent philosophical points that will leave you thinking when the credits roll. It's that kind of movie. I was very pleasantly surprised to see that this movie didn't go the cartoony, campy direction. It so easily could have. But it went a much more thoughtful and clever way than I ever would've anticipated. I predict this movie becoming a classic, totally quotable movie, for years to come. Most of all I enjoyed myself at the movies again."
"Going into the movie, i went in mostly blind and didn't expect much into the way it explored a deeper and more abstract plotline. Cast was star-studded and everything seemed to be in place, nothing off there. However, to me, the movie couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a more serious movie with a straight plotline or being goofy with a more abstract plotline. I think the humor was well-executed, but the movie leaned too much into both sides. By doing that, the potential in the movie if they had picked and focused on one solely was diminished. Excellent individual performances from ferrell, gosling, and greenblatt."
"I really wanted to like the movie, and I totally enjoyed the first third of it, until it turned into a lecture on patriarchy. Women are portrayed as infinitely oppressed people who can't do anything except for crying about their existence.Don't get me wrong, I expected it to be about feminism and empowerment, but not that awfully straightforward about it.I could've been a great movie. A 10/10 movie, but it feels like the authors just hate men so much, they can't think of anything else.I also feel sorry for all female executives at Mattel. The board of directors is portrayed as oppressively male-only, to maintain the narrative.To sum up, you gonna love it if you want to feel sad and oppressed about being a woman. Not so much if you just like Barbies and want to have a good time."
"My 20 year old daughter and I loved this movie so much. It was adorable and funny and surprisingly heartwarming. I really think anyone would enjoy this though. It had such a sweet simple message done so colorfully. Perfect casting. Margot Robbie literally is a doll. And Ryan Gosling is a combination of hot and funny. We wore pink of course and saw some cute outfits. A couple Ken shirts. While we were leaving, still teary eyed, seeing the mothers, daughters, friends and sisters all wearing pink, it was so touching and we thought how lucky they were to be able to watch Barbie for the first time. I still feel emotional hours later thinking about it. Highly recommend."
"The most anticipated summer movie turned out to meet my expectations. The sets,acting,costumes,story line everything was pink magic. It is a very inspiring movie for girls but I think a bit too much feminism and toxicity.No doubt, the movie is advertising barbies but it's still a good find.It's light hearted and it kept it's humor throughout the film., even in deep scenes. The cast was perfect for their own respective roles but something was very disappointing for me that literally Dua Lipa's role was less than two minutes.Overall I think the movie is worth watching once in your life and it will be memorable. The soundtrack is perfect
Dance the night by Dua Lipa was perfectly in place and also What was I made for.When I watched What was I made for on YouTube, I did not like it but in the cinema it was perfect.It is a great movie but not everyone will like it
Waiting for Barbie number 2 now. Hopefully next summer."
"It has great moments. The beginning might be the strongest I've ever seen. Unique. The soundtrack has a few songs that fall flat but overall it was very strong. Cinematography was unreal. Calling the old woman beautiful was rare and cool. The writing does seem to break down eventually though like really dropping the ball articulating the themes at times. Its not ""dark, weird, and crazy"" to have thoughts about death. That was just a strange choice. Margot Robbie had the best performance by far.I really think the movie aims for a message of equality so its kinda contradictory that the resolution in barbieland is a woman-run government. I get what they're doing. I get its not a real place. But then why make a joke about letting the men have a few seats in the lower courts, when four women sit on the supreme court today. Joke about them just not being able to be president or something if you want it to hit home.I think when people call this movie ""preachy"" theyre mostly talking about America Ferrera's speech. A lot of the points are valid but idk about:""And it turns out in fact that not only are you doing
everything wrong, but also everything is your fault.""""never fall down, never fail, never show fear""Maybe in finance bro world? I still think the movie is well-intentioned. You should and they do preach equality.I think legally blonde handled the same message better. You see people not taking her seriously throughout. It felt more developed like yes all these things are disadvantages that should change but you're already overcoming them while not shedding any femininity you may enjoy."
"""I'm just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us. And if all of that is also true for a doll...""Bro I was so excited just to look at the beautiful painted sets and watch the beautiful Barbies and Kens wear goofy clothes...but this was a deep movie.The seemingly perfect matriarchal world of Barbie has has a sudden setback when the perfectly Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie)'s heels land flatly on the ground.Barbie has to leave Barbieland through a surreal theatrical series of vehicles to wind up in California, where she meets her creators at Mattel and others.Of course Mattel, one of the producers, wanted to paint themselves in a positive light. They probably over-emphasize their importance in the playroom (They assert Barbie was the first doll to not be a baby doll, the first opportunity little girls had to play at being something other than a mother, which I find hard to believe). But there is definitely some honest criticism in the movie of who Barbie is and what she represents. Does Barbie make women feel bad about their bodies? Maybe.There are also a couple very playful moments where it feels almost like it feels when one plays with toys. Made me think of the Lego Movie (Which also had Will Ferrell in it).Then there's the characters. There is humor. There is music. There are of, course, gorgeous people and sets. But most of all, there is self-actualization and growth.I love every line in this film. I keep thinking about it. I've seen the movie twice now and I hope to see it again. Please watch it. Prepare to cry."
"The movie started out fun and strong. I agree with some of the other reviews on here that the cast was excellent, set design superb, etc. However, the plot needed more clarity and to choose a better direction.What I liked: It emphasized how with Barbie/dolls girls get to imagine themselves becoming all the things they can imagine and in their worlds they can control everything. Unfortunately, in the real world, patriarchy exists and we're limited. I liked it didn't marry Barbie off to Ken or make her have to have a relationship to be happy.What I didn't like: The stereotypical treatment of men and the relegation of them back to second class citizens in Barbie land. That things got confusing and hard to follow. Why exactly were all Barbies instantly brainwashed but stereotypical Barbie?I wish they could have handled the gender issues in a way to enforce more equality between the Kens and the Barbies without necessarily marrying them all of in pairs. Maybe Ken finally does get his mojo dojo saloon just not by taking over Barbies dream house. He gets acknowledged and gets his space too. Maybe he hooks up with Midge because he moves on. Maybe he gets a beach house so he can Beach off whenever he wants. I don't know. It was funny. I laughed out loud several times. Glad I saw it. Just wish they went some different directions."
"I anticipated this movie long before it came out and already watched it twice in the cinema. Greta Gerwig managed to make our wildest Barbie-dreams come true and not only created some of the funniest comedy i've seen in a long time in a movie, but also made me agree so hard with every feminist message she put in the film. Messages that everyone needs to hear - even, or should i say, especially men.The performances where wonderful, particularly that of Ryan Gosling who really tapped into his Kenergy. I thought it was interesting to see that not only Barbie aka Margo Robbie got a character arc, where she got to grow up to become a woman. Also Ken aka Ryan Gosling underwent some significant character growth that I much appreciated.As the trailer said; If you love Barbie, you will love this film. If you hate Barbie, you will still love this film. Because it isn't only about a doll, but also about the patriarchal system we all have to deal with on a daily basis and about the complexity that is human life in general. Who would have thought a movie about Barbie could do such things?"
"Barbie has captured many nuances of the societal stereotypes, challenged these tenets with a tactful yet fun twist. The main standout truly is the costume design. Highly diverse yet coherently put together to honor the Barbie concept. Borrowing elements from the Chanel's haute couture collection, to some of the rarest outfits from Barbie, it was such a unique experience to observe such understated works of art; even the extras/minor characters were wearing beautiful pieces. Some of the best costume design I've seen over the years.The plot was rather textbook, but definitely enjoyed the witty subtle jokes which created good tension and suspension. Well-balanced and great character development for most characters except for Sasha who changed opinions just too quickly for my taste."
"Barbie is such a fun time, the whole cast collectively deserve an award. Contrary to what some people are already claiming, this is not a men hating film, it is so much nuanced than that. In fact, by the film's conclusion it is clearly demonstrated why extremes wouldn't work, we all need each other and we need to learn how to coexist. I'm so glad this film had something to say. I can tell a certain faction of pea-brained individuals are absolutely gonna seethe when they see this film, and that just make me love it even more. I can't believe a movie like this got such a huge budget and is such a success."
"I was super excited to see this movie but I'm coming away from the cinema a bit disappointed. The marketing for this was amazing and everyone who watched it said that its not going to be what I expect and so my expectations were very high. There were some clever jokes and very beautiful sets and costumes but honestly the plot was hard to follow and there was nothing very nuanced or clever about the message. I think this film is a little late, maybe it would have resonated better a few years ago when these conversations were first taking place but to me it doesn't add much value to the feminist cause. It's worth seeing as it's definitely of cultural interest, but I won't be rewatching it."
"Making a Barbie movie about feminism is a cool idea. Having Barbie comment on the patriarchy just like Animal Farm about communism and Wall Street about capitalism. It's admirable and the message gets through.The problem is that the actual movie is so bad. Even though you buy in on the two worlds, etc, etc. In the end, it was like reading a textbook instead of a novel. Normally, the strengths with fables and allegories is that they are profound on many levels. Here, everything is spelled out from a a teacher's desk and the whole film comes across as bit thin.I would not watch this movie again."
"Was walking into this movie expecting a light-harder fun movie about Barbie and Ken, but left questioning the systemic inequality in our society. What many men will tell you is that this movie is just another woke feminist movie, but I highly encourage everyone to go watch Barbie to truly understand how women feel in todays world. Furthermore the production of the movie was greath. Everything from the cast, the plot, the pacing, the acting, the cinematography and ending was well done. I already know this movie is gonna cause lots of polarisation, but I would recommend everyone to watch this movie and come to their own conclusions."
"Barbie, the movie is great! It stars Margot Robbie as the character Barbie! There's also some so many starring actors/actresses who are also in that movie who they are fictitious! This movie is great for all viewers to watch, including millions people across the nation worldwide! The movie is a comedy, live action, and funny! Margot Robbie is an inspiring actress known for her movies, such as I, Tonya, About Time, and so much more! This movie is an inspiration for people who want to watch and see! Viewers who want to watch this movie watch it anywhere, anytime! Thank you, and have a nice day!!"
"I enjoyed this film. I cried at the ending and I laughed out loud at some parts, which is something not many films can actually do to me. I LOVED the visuals - it felt exactly like Barbie should feel to look at, and I love how the film never seems to take itself too seriously, which again, is what I expect from a film about a Barbie doll.Having said that, there were a few things I questioned. I'm not the target audience (being a 17 year old guy), but also... who WAS the target audience? It feels like it should be for kids, but it was far too existential for that, especially at the end, and some of the jokes were just blatantly sexual. Was it for people who used to own Barbies as a kid? It was still enjoyable, but I wouldn't recommend it for small children or even children at all, really.I feel like I have to be careful saying this, but the message of the film was a bit over the top. I understand it and I liked that it was there, but it felt a bit crammed down our throats. It almost feels like a caricature of our own world at times. The real world sucks, but the divide between men and women isn't THAT pronounced - not all men are incompetent, macho freaks who have everything handed to them on a silver platter, and not all women are suppressed as intensely as the film seems to suggest. Still, it was a good message and made me emotional at points, and it was still a fun film experience, albeit not what I was expecting."
"When I first heard about this movie, I didn't want to see it. Then I watched the trailer and my mind was changed instantly. Margot Robbie as Barbie could not have been a better casting choice, Ryan Gosling as Ken was just *chef's kiss*. It's a wonderfully beautiful and talented cast. It's charming, funny, touching, powerful and overall perfect. The soundtrack is fantastic, I've been listening to I'm Just Ken on repeat for days now. The diversity and representation within the cast is beautiful and so exciting to see in a movie as big as this one. Greta Gerwig and everyone who worked on this movie absolutely knocked it out of the park."
"Fantastic musicals, a brutally honest storyline on challenges and struggles for both genders across the barbie land and our world.A must watch of the year 2023.Barbie: A Journey of ImaginationIn the vibrant world of Toyland, a place where toys come to life, Barbie, a beautiful and kind-hearted doll, finds herself on a captivating adventure of self-discovery and empowerment. Directed by visionary filmmaker Alex Jenkins, ""Barbie: A Journey of Imagination"" is an enchanting animated movie that celebrates friendship, courage, and the limitless power of imagination.The film begins in Barbie's quaint dollhouse, where she lives with her fellow toy friends. However, Barbie feels a sense of longing and curiosity about the world beyond her little abode. One day, as she gazes out the window, she spots a mysterious, twinkling portal in the garden. Curiosity getting the better of her, she bravely steps through the portal and is transported to a wondrous realm of magic and adventure.In this new world, Barbie encounters a diverse group of toy creatures, each possessing unique abilities and personalities. She befriends Ruffle, a playful and mischievous teddy bear, and Sparkle, a wise and spirited unicorn. Together, they embark on a quest to restore the balance of imagination, which has been fading away due to the influence of an evil sorceress named Malina.Malina, once a guardian of creativity, has grown envious of the joy and happiness that toys bring to children's lives. She seeks to imprison imagination forever, believing it to be the source of her own loneliness. With her dark magic, she manipulates innocent toys into causing havoc and despair across Toyland.As Barbie and her newfound friends journey through enchanted forests and whimsical lands, they encounter numerous challenges and confront their fears. Each trial brings them closer together and strengthens their resolve to defeat Malina and restore the world's imagination.Along the way, Barbie discovers the power of belief in oneself. Initially uncertain of her abilities, she realizes that her kind heart and compassionate nature make her a unique and formidable force. This self-discovery becomes a source of inspiration for Ruffle and Sparkle, who learn to embrace their individual strengths.As the trio approaches the final showdown with Malina, they face their most significant obstacle yet: the power of doubt. Doubtful of their ability to defeat the sorceress, Barbie reminds her friends that belief in themselves and each other is essential. They draw strength from their friendship and from the countless children who have loved and cherished them through the years.The climactic battle between good and evil unfolds in a spectacular display of magic and determination. Barbie and her friends demonstrate that imagination, fueled by love and friendship, can conquer any darkness. As the battle rages on, the power of imagination begins to flood Toyland once more, dispelling Malina's dark influence.In a breathtaking conclusion, Barbie confronts Malina with empathy, understanding the sorceress's loneliness and pain.

Barbie returns through the portal to her dollhouse, but she is forever changed by her journey, now understanding the boundless power of imagination.The movie ends with a heartwarming scene of children playing with their toys, each igniting their imagination and creativity. Barbie, now more than just a doll, symbolizes the spark of inspiration that lives in every child's heart, reminding them that dreams are limitless and that they can achieve anything they set their minds to.""Barbie: A Journey of Imagination"" is a timeless tale that emphasizes the importance of embracing one's uniqueness, believing in oneself, and cherishing the power of friendship and imagination. It inspires both children and adults to let their imaginations soar and to find the magic that exists within each and every one of us."
"I completely enjoyed Greta Gerwig's outstanding movie Barbie. It was delightful to see on the big screen with the great soundtrack and the eye-popping colors. Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie and she made a great movie even better.Someone asked why a 60+ adult female like me would go to see this kids movie.For me, Barbie was such a huge part of my childhood. Playing ""Barbs"" with my best friend as a young girl is one of my most cherished memories. It was something just for girls when we were mostly excluded from being in any lead role in the world (our moms, aunts, grandma's were excluded too). No sports, few female leads in film or television, few jobs outside of the pink collar ghetto we were kept in. Barbie was beautiful and the center of her own story. For this reason I had to go on opening weekend to vote for the world of Barbie, to say,
thank you."
"Wow, this was really bad. Here is the truth. It's boring. Plus, who wants to here about the patriarchy for 2hrs. Yes, the word patriarchy is said like 100 times. It's crazy. This was so heavy handed I don't even get why woman would like it....ithis should be fun, not some political statement. Let me tell you, the only fun was in the first 30 mins. Nobody, and I mean Nobody was laughing. The plot is all over the place and kind of surprising from the actual writer, which has done some great work in the past. Just makes me wonder if she was forced to push all this political stuff by corporate or she actually believes this nonsense. I thought Barbie would just be a fun goofy movie. But to be preached for 2 hours????? What the hell. I'm telling you most people will not like this movie, unless you're far far left."
"This is just one of the two films that are released on the same day (the other being Oppenheimer). Firstly, the movie itself was good; a few comic jokes here and there along with a few heartfelt moments at the end. But I'm not technically a Barbie fan; I just see something that I fancy on the big screen and watch it!Anyway, after watching the movie, I thought to myself, ""Gosh, I'm amazed at how the filmmakers got to create such a variety of cast members, as well as make such a great movie for the girls to enjoy.""For someone as me - who is somewhat of a film expert and a cinema employee - to see what might be just the most iconic blockbuster movie of the year so far, I have to say that it could (by a margin) be busy for the first couple of weeks of the summer holidays!Overall, though it was good, it's not my favourite movie as I'm not a fan of the doll franchise."
"This movie was such great experience to live. It's a fun, entertaining, deep, and amazing piece of art. It was very funny at times, made me cry other times, and made me feel nostalgic and warm and proud and all of these different feelings. But most importantly it made me think! I really love it when movies discuss topics that matter and shake your ideas a little bit. I loved the cast, the costume designs, the music and everything in between. Margot Robbie is a queen, her acting was amazing and she's just the perfect cast for this role. Also, Ryan did an amazing job and so did the rest of the cast. Judging by the propaganda that surrounded it and the hype around it I didn't have high expectations but honestly I was pleasantly surprised. Also, I have to say that the story of this movie is very very similar to ""Free guy"" the one with Ryan Reynolds but it was done well so I can't complain."
"Very light spoilers.I didn't go into this movie thinking I would love it as much as I did. I went because I have 9 and 6 year old girls and especially the youngest loves Barbie. There were definitely jokes that were not appropriate for them but went right over their head, but they very much enjoyed the movie.The message was great and Ryan Gosling stole the show as a dopey Ken. Margot was great as Barbie, as were all of the actresses who played Barbies. I especially loved America Ferrera in her role! She was great.There were many times I cried in this movie because it's so on the nose about being a woman today, and it hit me hard having two young girls. I did not expect to shed any tears so that was a surprise!The reason I gave this an 8 instead of a 10 is because there were definitely some plot holes, like why Barbie had to bring America and her daughter to Barbie Land and what the very bad thing that would happen was (per the execs) by Barbie leaving the Barbie world. Many things weren't explained or didn't make much sense, but it was still a joy to watch.Overall I loved the movie and I'm so glad we went. All women should see this movie."
"LOVED IT. Truly an amazing movie. A lot of people would maybe say that it's boring but to me it was super super cool, it held my attention from start to finish. Not just a movie this thing isnan experience that brings me so much joy if you go to the cinema. So many people there, dressed in pinkish clothes, feels like everyone there is happy and all of people there are unites under the idea of Barbie. The movie itself, has so many great messages to the word. I am sure a lot of little girls didn't quite understand it but they will one day. It also had so many real word/trensing things added to it.I probably liked it so much because I grew up watching old barbie movies, and now it felt like Barbie has grown with me, especially cause the topic of the movie was very real in todays world.Going in before the movie I thought it would turn out to be just ""okay"" since I saw a lot of parts from it as trailers I thought ""oh I alredy saw it all"", nahh, little did i know. Those trailers are nothing compared to this.I really reccomend watching it. But there are some parts that are ""not for kids""(ex. Some things they say, initiate...), But it's just maybe 3 times in all 114minutes of the movie."
"It was nostalgic, hilarious, esthetically orgasmic and very moving. It covered all generations of Barbie, which was my hands down favorite toy as a kid. It also touched on the female experience in a really welcoming, wonderful way. I felt it included aspects of the male experience that are important as well. Awesome soundtrack, AMAZING SETS, and wardrobes. The cast was amazing, the writing was perfect, such an original, unique stroy line. If you're going to criticize this movie for going ""against your political beliefs"" then you don't deserve this movie anyways. Women are allowed to talk about the female experience and Barbie was a great way to do it! I just saw it 2 days ago and I really want to see it again!!"
"My wife dragged me to see this, after I took her to see Indiana Jones. I'm not going to jump on this band wagon, this was a silly movie. I know what you are thinking ""typical male"", but no, I was willing to see this and put a high rating, if necessary.The story is silly, and Will Ferrell really has to find a different movie scout. He's been in some horrendous movies of late. He's such a funny actor, but in this movie, it just didn't suit him and he wasn't funny in it. He tries too hard in this, and not his humourous self.So, why not one star? Why four stars you say?First up, America Ferrara, who plays Gloria in this movie, does deserve a credit for her good acting. She's a great actress, especially in the role she plays here. One star for her.Secondly, there were a few laugh out loud moments in the movie. Not gonna lie, I did laugh in some scenes. Up to two stars.Thirdly, I could tell the actors had a lot of fun making this movie, and there were a lot of chorography in the dancing that would have taking a lot of time to practice. Up to three stars.Lastly, a few cameo appearances of A class actors popped up and it was funny to see. The last star given.It's not a 1 star, it's watchable, but still very silly.For me, I've watched it, but I wouldn't rush out to watch it again, or watch it when it comes on digital platforms later in the year. I will maybe watch it in ten years time. Maybe.."
"Didn't watch the trailer and went to see the Barbie movie, thinking it would be a regular comedy about a doll. I liked the idea of dressing up in pink with my daughter and going to a girly movie. But I was very surprised when I found out that there was a deep meaning hidden in the pink world of Barbie Land! The movie touches on women's issues: being always perfect, managing everything, being beautiful, perfect mothers, cooks, careerists and wives. The movie also shows men who don't know who they are without their women, cars, jobs. I cried, I was moved by the dialogues. I loved the movie! I was especially impressed by the moment at the bus stop, when Barbie sat next to an old lady and praised her for her beauty. The old lady smiled and said: I know :) It was so cute and wise! It made me realize that growing old is not scary if you love yourself as you are. You don't need to chase youth, there is beauty and dignity in every age. I am grateful to the directors Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach for making the Barbie movie not only a fun comedy, but also a deep drama about finding yourself and your place in the world. They showed that Barbie is not just a doll, but a heroine who can be anyone and do anything. They also honored the memory of Ruth Handler, who gave millions of girls the opportunity to dream and strive for the best. I think that the Barbie movie is not only a movie for children, but also for adults who want to go back to their roots and find their inner beauty. I recommend this movie to everyone who loves Barbie or just wants to watch a good movie with an important message."
"Barbie blew my expectations away. I have never seen such a brilliantly written movie that makes me want to immediately rewatch. Every detail was thought of in Barbie's world and the satire of the Ken's and patriarchal society was hilarious and relatable as a woman. The dialogue was perfectly childish (as if children were playing with the barbie's speaking) and intelligent. America Ferrara's monologue about the hardships of being a woman was spot on and every woman in the theater could relate. The movie was fun and heartfelt while also drawing attention to society's imperfections. Men who say this film isn't good or ""anti-man"", is part of the problem."
"The voice over commentary in some parts had me laughing to no end. Most of the Will Ferrel scenes I could have been edited out, they were too campy and distracted from the rest of the movie, fortunately they were few and resigned to the later 1/3 of the movie.To be honest I missed most of the big name actors, however Rhea Perlman was spot on perfect in her role.Margo Robbie and Ryan Gosling were excellent as well, with Ryan giving an overtop hammy performance that allowed Margo to shine as the epitome of what Barbie represents, future possibilities.Kate McKinnon was well cast and delivered flawlessly.A couple scenes were overplayed.As a moderately middle-aged man I might have laughed a little to hard in some places. It was well worth seeing, so much so that I even dressed up as 80s fashion Ken when I went."
"It truly surprises me how greta gerwig revolutionizes the film industry, with a movie that's seemingly so simple and ""childlike"" and turning it into a life lesson and still keeping the fun in it. It has so many fun elements in it but still gives off its message so clearly. How well it was filmed and directed was truly astounding to see how it was not only visually beautiful and aesthetically pleasing but also the writing and the acting. Every part of this movie was well thought out and it shows. My only critique is that the pace at the ending was a bit too fast and random but it ultimately makes sense in the movie so it's excusable."
"I was excited to see what this movie would delve into, and it being from a woman's point of view sounded promising. I was expecting a fun, slightly superfluous film, but safe to say, it was so much more than that.The first thing I'd like to point out is the meticulous outfit designing, it perfectly encapsulates the energy of Barbie, but with a modern touch.The dreamhouse was designed with attention to even the tiniest details.I loved how a lot of elements of the movie were portrayed from the viewpoint of a little girl - The lack of water in Barbieland, Barbie ""flying"" to her car, and the 'world' map.The movie just kept getting more and more enthralling. The exploration of the patriarchy in the 'real' world is eerily accurate. The raw, unadulterated expression of the dilemmas of womanhood is one which speaks for women and girls all around the world.I appreciate how the movie concluded with not the return of the matriarchal Barbieland, but an effort to strive for equilibrium, which acknowledges the sentiments of both men and women, which is a progressive message to carry out.Handler's dissertation on the immortality of ideas, and essence of humanity was quite profound.The acting, everyone's, was entertaining and impeccable, without it , the movie could never be just as good.The soundtrack, while song-oriented, was still effective at projecting the vibe and aesthetic of the movie into one's ears.Overall, this movie is more than just ""glitter and sparkles"", it symbolically confronts the facets of our society. It is truly a film, anyone,
Barbie fan or not, can appreciate, and should watch."
"This is not a great movie - when you get down to it, it's not even a good movie. It's a popcorn movie at best. The best thing it has going for it? Margot Robbie as Barbie: she does channel the role well and when her world turns upside down, you genuinely feel sorry for her. At the other end of the scale - Ryan Gosling as Ken. Gosling is good at stretching into roles, but no matter what - Ken was an androgenous doll and Gosling can't stretch the role anything more than that. He looks like a character out of ZOOLANDER and whenever he is on the screen, i was cringing in my seat. There are definitely funny moments: my favorite? When Ken runs into the ocean to surf. Definitely a woman's movie from the first preach to the final cast roll - it got old fast and the screenplay didn't seem to have much substance after the ""I am woman"" speeches. I thought it was me, but there was a lot of kids in the theatre and they all appeared to be bored as well. Sorry Greta => This is not your ticket to the Oscars."
"Barbie is a modern fantasy with lots of metaphors about existentialism & feminism, and how everybody (men & women) should get equal opportunity. The archetypal Barbie & Ken have fulfilling story arcs. As do the main human characters when Barbie World and the Real World collide. That collision is a big part of making this a fantasy.It looks and sounds great. Its messages are fab. It'll annoy the right people. It's a big-budget Gerwig & Baumbach film. I love their films. I loved this. I'll be making at least one more trip to the cinema to see it again, and it'll be an instant buy when available on iTunes."
"I have watched barbie since I was born, I've collected the dolls the dresses and many other barbie themed things. I know all the movies by heart and the songs and I love barbie so when I saw this movies trailer and the marketing I went crazy!! I was so excited to watch it and support this movie.The beginning of the movie was quite fun and funny, very colorful. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling play their roles so well and really carry the movie. It contained all the things expected from a barbie movie. The plot was great but halfway through the movie it becomes very serious and turns a bit preachy so if you want to take your kids to the movies to watch this, Id suggest not doing so because I don't think they'll understand much about patriarchy and sexism, its definitely not aimed at younger children (12 and below).I was hoping for some more funny moments and homage to the barbie movies so I was a tad bit disappointed not to see it however it was still a nice movie, enjoyable and a feel good movie.I understand the message given out that you can be whoever you want to be but it could have been slightly more light hearted ."
"I loved this movie more than I thought I would!! I laughed, cried, and honestly loved the message. All the niche references made me smile, too!!Normally I do not rewatch movies while they are in theaters but I am planning on taking my sibling this weekend so they can experience the same joy!I don't understand the people who are upset over Ken being an accessory to Barbie. It is literally pointed out in the movie how misogyny is a huge problem in the real world and they are upset over one validating movie. Unbelievable. Please ignore the ""anti-man"" reviews. This movie isn't anti-man. If anything, it's anti-patriarchy and makes fun of it."
"This movie was everything I didn't know I needed. Was great to just escape from the world for 2 hours. Truly one of the most fun movies I've seen in a while. Fun from beginning to end. Margot was amazing and so was Ryan gosling. 100% recommend for everyone especially if you're a father to a daughter I think it has a Good Message Emmet for all, but especially girls to be what they want to be, and how they can truly be anything. The outfits and stages were amazing. It literally looks like you were at a toy store. I will be surprised if they don't win anything for costumes. I definitely will be buying this movie when it comes out."
"This movie is so good. It is existential, funny, childish, and adult at the same time.It is uncomfortable in the way that it perverts reality turning it on its head, and it forces the audience to confront the uncomfortable truths about reality that we have normalized.This movie invokes a deep sense of sentimentalism, hope, and the beauty of ideas and dreams.Also, can we talk about Margot Robbie???? Does this woman have Oscars, because she is so freaking amazing. When I heard that Margot Robbie was going to be Barbie I was leery. Could Harley Quinn really embody the larger than life legacy of Barbie???Who would Barbie be? Really, a white Barbie with blonde hair as the main character? Isn't that so stereotypical?????Well, let me tell you something. Margot Robbie should give a master class on acting. That woman needs to take a freaking bow and so does Greta Gerwing. I mean seriously...!!! Margot Robbie going from Wolf on Wallstreet, to Harley Quinn, to Babylon, now to Barbie.How does the woman embody two opposing emotions at once with such precision and authenticity????Well, enough fan girl-ing. This movie is awesome. It's a little on the nose with all the patriarchy stuff, but I think it needs to be. It's as though it marches right up to all the critiques it knows it will have and dares them to say something.It reminds me of something a man on tik-tok said recently. Men are told that they are supposed to be respected by women, and respectful women often go unheard. Well, this movie is anything but respectful. It gives patriarchy the 🐦 and reminds us that we are all important not because of our gender but in spite of it.Go out and watch it. Take your kids. You'll laugh, you'll wince, you'll feel excited, you'll dream, you'll empathize, and you'll believe."
"Well, scenography is nice, wardrobe is nice and actress are pretty. The plot is non existent and the whole movie tries to be something it's not - a social commentary so it dives in whole other area and topics and fails. I didn't have any expectations coming to the cinema, I just assumed it was light and funny movie but instead I got a speech about patriarchy and men's world. Not to say it isn't but it's not something you would expect from a Barbie movie that was marketed as fun and comedy movie.Development of the characters is non existent so they are constantly changing their mood and personality without any explanation."
"I expected this movie to be a quick predictable cashgrab with as much stars as possible for the poster, it turned out to be way more. It has its flaws, but they quickly move past that.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling absolutely killed it. It had great social commentary, while still being funny and wildly entertaining. The design is great, from set design to music to choreography. It's a feast to see all those stars dancing together, and the use of color is amazing.The story was well illustrated, with showing you the message clearly, they sometimes straight up tell you things, but those things are well explained in the context.The real world part didn't stick to its own rules, sometimes it was complete fantasy when it needed to be, and sometimes it was supposed to be ""harsh reality"" which therefore just didn't work. Cliché's and tropes were sometimes a bit too much, but I didn't really expect something else than that. The end-conversation was a bit pretentious, and a bit weaker than it tried to be for me. I could understand that it hit all the right spots for somebody else. The jokes were great, and I laughed a lot. Loved how it looked like the lego movie sometimes.8,2/10
Well done. Now Im gonna watch Oppenheimer."
"Barbie was a big surprise for me, I enjoyed every sip of this delicious pink drink that teleports you to a bright world where imagination is real and reality is just a tiny dreamland nowhere and everywhere. The production design was out of this world and the casting of this movie was perfect, every frame was shot and directed beautifully, in general, the technical aspect was brilliant. Still what impressed me the most was the writing! Greta and Noah wrote a masterpiece film that explores while criticizing the good, the bad, and the ugly in the flaws of human nature in the eyes of Barbie and Kent in their fun adventure in the real world and the imaginary one. What was outstanding in this fun ride is the ability to combine all these meaningful feelings and emotions in one movie in a light sarcastic theme and not forget to present the real issues in our world nowadays and the conflict while analyzing the diverse ideologies that clash in this mess, all of this was done through an objective talented lens."
I liked the movie and really enjoyed myself watching it. I did think the feminism was a little too 'on the nose' sometimes. But it's difficult to make a film that caters to all audiences. Overall it was a job well done. The set was beautiful and everything expected from a Barbie movie. Simu Liu and Ryan Gosling were showstealers as rivalling Kens and Margot Robbie was perfectly cast. I was also really surprised that the slogan 'a movie for people who love Barbie and people who hate Barbie' caught the essence. They didn't shy away addressing the controversies surrounding some of the Barbie dolls and Mattel as a company.
"As someone said, this is a bittersweet pill. A film that intends to be entertainment and toy marketing, but somehow, it brought tears out of my eyes.I love it. I love everything about it. I love everything it represents: identity crisis, toxic masculinity, and glorifying the value of dolls. Greta Gerwig took an idea that seemed outdated, like ""Barbie,"" to tell a vivid contemporary story. At the very same time, the film also teases itself and all sorts of pop culture. And all the productions-oh my, they are all very pleasing to my eyes and ears.Some that I'm stuck on are the half-jokes/half-seriously tone, which makes the final act not as powerful as it should be. The overexplaining of characters, when they said everything they thought but didn't really show it in another way, and Ken's arc are not completely closure to me.In the end, Billie Eilish's song is the key to winning my heart. Man, that song and that scene are so beautiful."
"The plot is interesting enough to make you feel interested and intrigued even if you're not a barbie fan or just not a fan of cliches, it has a beautiful meaning behind it and it's the best movie for you to watch if you're a woman . This movie is great , i usually don't watch movies with high hopes but i did with this one and still it surprised me . The marketing crew did an insanely perfect job , the hole mall was wearing pink and it helped people on building the hype for the movie. The whole thing is genius, the performances ( specially ryan and margot ) are outstanding and genuinely really good , the direction is great and the whole soundtrack is fantastic. Final consideration : GO WATCH BARBIE , it's worth it."
"I take it the sales of Barbie and Ken have plummeted over the last few years. This isn't a movie, it's an advertising campaign. Fair play to all involved, the movie actors and producers and the manufacturer will make a fortune. But as a movie, this is utter garbage, no real substance to the plot and the way the film has been written is a shambles. If the writers are on strike in Hollywood we should all be grateful for the respite. Hopefully whilst they are on strike they can come up with some substantial plots and decent writing. When the unjustified hype calms down this will be remembered for being awful."
"Film story line is GREAT! You can totally understand what does director and writer they create a UNBELIVABLE FILM...If You Like BARBIE you must watch! But if you hate BARBIE you must barely GO TO WATCH THIS!!!Im never expect how can casting can be so professional to let Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling being Barbie & Ken, Im barely enjoy their acting fun and enjoy their characther in this film... Like the Acting coach said""Make believe.""Moral of the stories, In The Critical World we are living in a terrible world, we always hope we had an wonderful life, But if we really live in a freedom and peaceful world, we may be not having a perfect life in ourself, GO ENJOY YOUR LIFE LIKE A BARBIE!!!"
"More could you want from a movie? How about Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, and Hari Nef all playing Barbie variations, like Weird Barbie, President Barbie, and Doctor Barbie. Plus, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Simu Liu, and Ncuti Gatwa are all playing Kens. Will Ferrell plays the CEO of Mattel, the company who first brought us Barbie and her Dreamhouse. The film focuses on what happens when the perfect doll has an existential crisis, and Mattel's pursuit to stop Barbie from changing the real world forever. Greta Gerwig ('Lady Bird') directs a script she co-wrote with partner and fellow filmmaker Noah Baumbach ('Marriage Story'). Drop by the Dreamhouse in your pink convertible when the movie premieres in July 2023."
"I saw it in a theater the day after I saw Oppenheimer and it was a fun movie.I honestly think Margot Robbie is perfect as barbie in this movie. Ryan Gosling as Ken is also good. I think that because of the movies PG-13 rating the movie doesn't target audience aren't kids and there were some violence scenes and Barbie really mentions a lot of death and she has thoughts of dying.The movie opened $155M and I think it's going to reach $1B at the worldwide box office.The things I really liked some of the soundtrack. The soundtrack features Billie Eilish, Ice Spice and Nicki Minaj, Dua Lipa, and so much more singers. I also really loved the song Just Ken by Ryan Gosling. I also loved the idea of making this movie and the director Greta Gerwig is just a great film director from movies such as Lady Bird and Little Women.Some scenes were very boring but I guess it's ok.I just think that you can't compare this movie to Oppenheimer because Oppenheimer is way better.It's a good movie.It's still a good movie and my expect."
"I really thought this would just be a cute movie, but it actually had a very deep message and I really hope people can take the messages away from this movie because there was a few. I think they did great with the Barbie movie. It was entertaining. The special effects were adorable, but the message was so HUGE in this movie.Watching these light fluffy cute reviews, I know most people missed it.First of all, Barbie was very empowering in her own world where she could be anything she wanted and looking her best while doing it AND the men were not needed, NOT IN CHARGE and all The Ken's cared about was whether or not, they received any attention from their Barbie
Sound familiar kept wives? Trophy Wives you have no other purpose except to look incredible for your stupid rich husband. That was Ken.The second she went into the real world. She was cat called had her ass slapped, got arrested for defending herself, and was treated with pretty privilege at the police station all while being treated like a blonde bimbo by people in the street. The complete opposite of Barbieland.I hope that people can take away from Barbie and Ken how the roles were reversed when they went from Barbieland to the real world and you could see Barbie becoming very anxious and self-conscious, while Ken became very self-confident, felt amazing he felt empowered immediately for the first time in his life, and you could almost see him go from proud to being a man to toxic masculinity within one scene.The teen angst was a good part too. Barbie was empowering to millions of girls but not to everybody. She has also given millions a very severe complex about body image, pretty privilege and society accepting them only if they look a certain way and Barbieland totally emphasizes that.Even the biggest Barbie was well done up. Dresses well hair done speaks delicately.Everyone there was picture perfect. Dainty and feminine. Even the Supreme Court were beauty pageant champions.This movie is actually deeper than I thought it would be. It was really good I really like Margot Robbie I think she's absolutely adorable as Barbie and I felt bad for her for most of the movie because she went from being a brilliant, beautiful and inspiring idol to some cat called bimbo with pretty privilege in the real world that they wanted to just put in a box."
"The Barbie movie is a such a sweet, fun movie. And absolutely hilarious. The whole theater was laughing. We laughed. We cried and we all danced. But we were lucky to have the best crowd at our showing which made the experience that much more enjoyable! So I highly recommend that you go to a good area to watch it. The people around can either make or break the sweet experience. It has been a long time since I've watched a movie that was actually clean and fun. The story is so entertaining. And the ending was absolutely amazing. The writers did an amazing job and the cast was absolute perfect in every way! God watch it. But get in your Barbie glam first!"
"Unfortunately this story is so bad the acting and sets can't save it .It is pretty to look at like a Barbie , but lacks a story that is worth the effort .I think small girls will like it but other than that it's a stupid movie idea that comes across as an advertisement for a toy company .Not sure you will want to spend your money on this wait for it to stream .Kids fell asleep after the first 30 minutes .Not sure who the audience is .The story is so bad it's like it was hobbled together by a bunch of tweens brainstorming .I think this could be the worst movie of the decade .There are much better kids movies out there."
"I absolutely loved it. Margot Robbie is the perfect stereotypical Barbie. Ryan Gosling gives an Oscar-worthy performance and has a true rock 'n' roll voice. The soundtrack is also very, very good. Subjects of patriarchy and cultural hegemony are approached with humour and historical references. Michael Cera is funnily adorable. Barbie is funny and surprisingly entertaining. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach wrote an enchanting script with genuine emotion. Barbie was brilliantly cast. I loved Ryan Gosling. He's terrific as Ken and delivers an Oscar-worthy performance. The ending is good and it's worth sticking around to watch the credits."
"Watched it twice and enjoyed it even more on the second watch. Definitely not the all-enlightening and god-saving movie to the feminist movement but it does touch on a lot of issues in such a beautiful, greta gerwig-esque way.The Barbie-Gloria, Gloria-Sasha, and Barbie-Ruth interactions are so impactful for mothers and daughters. Teared up a few times and would have definitely full on cried if I was home alone while watching the movie.Ryan Gosling was so good at playing Ken and making the audience laugh at him, laugh with him, feel bad for him, get mad at him, and understand him.Margot Robbie is just overall the perfect Barbie."
"As most are saying the casting was great. The costumes were awesome. Barbie land set design was on point. The story could have been so much better. It started out fine but dragged in the middle. It became preachy. We know, we live it everyday. Mention patriarchy and move on. I thought it would have been nice to show both sides working together equally in the end. It might not have been realistic but we would have left the theater with a smile. I was not alone leaving the theater thinking what was that all about. I did not see too many children in the theater which was good because it would have been way over their head."
"This one reminds me of why I love movies so much. Acting, dancing, visual arts, screenplay, plots, soundtracks, humor, moral, there are everything we need in a movie. What hit me the most is that I was only expecting the kind of adult humor in that Barbie song ""You can brush my hair undress me everywhere,"" but at some point I realize it's way more than that. The movie was hilarious that I remember my mouth was opened laughing the whole time you know, all the Barbie jokes. And it's so cute that just right at the beginning of the movie, I instantly fell back to my childhood memories and everything is pink it's so beautiful. Yet, it's such a deep movie that it told things we almost be numb to. It said it out loud to remind us who we are and what are our worth and where are we going and everything. It's a movie about love. I cried so hard and laughed so hard. It's a masterpiece."
"I didn't get emotional whilst watching the movie, but hours later when i looked back on how special this movie is for EVERYONE, especially young girls and women.I must have been 8 when i told my mum that i wanted to go on a diet. It's what i saw women doing online and i wanted to be as pretty as they were. Then i grew up and spent so many years being resentful of ""pretty girls"" who i saw daily because they had what i didn't. As a not-conventionally-attractive and disabled woman, i spent days feeling ugly and getting angry at other women and myself because i would never be them or be viewed by other people in the ways that they are. I avoided the mirror for months because i didn't want to see myself. I felt sick looking at my own complexion.It took me years to realise that every girl is a pretty girl. Men will put us down and hate this movie because they don't get it. This movie is a beautiful celebration of what it means to be a woman, to get old, to suffer at the hands of a society which forces us against each other.Gerwig is and incredible writer and director and seems to outdo her genius with every movie she does."
"Although the Barbie movie's funny bits were good for one viewing, and there were several funny bits throughout the film, I think the writer/director wrote herself into a corner so the ending just falls flat. The parodies were funny, and the contrasts with real life were funny, but the writers just didn't know where to go with the story in the end. A lot of Greta Gerwig's films are like that. Disappointing. I wouldn't see the Barbie movie more than once, which is sad, because I've seen Dial of Destiny four times, and I am going back for a fifth viewing. That film did not disappoint! This one could have been a lot better."
"This movie really is what I needed. The casting is perfect, Ryan Gosling as Ken nobody would've think it would be that good. I really had a fun time with a lot of laughs, yes there is a serious undertone in this movie about the diffference between women&men but it's given also in a fun way. America Ferrera is giving a bombing acting like she always does! Margot Robbie is just wauw, she is made for this role, i'm so glad she got the role and not Amy Schumer as previously requested. I would die to see the movie again for the first time, for now I will just wait for it to come on streaming and will stream it again! We are Kenough."
"I had high hopes for this film and have been looking forward to it for about a year. I was blown away by the level of humor, the emotion, the meaning, everything! Honestly, it should've been called Ken, as Ryan Gosling stole the show. I've always thought that he was underrated as a comedic actor. He was Ken. He owned it. He deserves awards for completely giving himself over to the character. Having said that, the entire cast was awesome. The music was incredible. The set design was perfect. I laughed and cried throughout. I didn't expect all of the feels, but there were so many messages that touched my heart. I look forward to many more viewings."
"Such a silly, beautiful, wonderful movie! This is truly a cinematic masterpiece. It has heart, soul, and lots of laughs. I've seen it twice so far and it honestly gets better with each watch. I'm looking forward to owning it when it comes out for purchase as well. This will definitely be one I watch a lot. Ryan Gosling's Ken is everything, and he's absolutely perfect. This entire movie is perfect. I don't want to say too much and spoil anything for those that haven't seen it yet, so just go ahead and do yourself a favor and go see it. What are you waiting for? P. S. Isn't not ""sexist"" it's making a point, and people that have a problem with what it's saying should probably ask themselves why and look inwards."
"This movie was not what I expected at first, but I loved it. It's been years since I watched a new big budget movie that was so bright and fun with its own sense of logic. Taika Waititi said in an interview that Hollywood (particularly superhero) movies have gotten so dark and when he was a kid he went to the cinema to escape the darkness of life. I feel like Barbie could be the start of the un-darkening of Hollywood movies.As a woman with some trauma, I love a good gritty woman-run movie that talks about how life feels as a woman in a man's world. Sometimes though, you just want some feel-good escapism that isn't forcing you to watch the female protagonist go through all sorts to get the message across.I've seen other reviews say that a lot of the movie didn't make sense. I feel like the way they executed it made sense for a Barbie movie. I've also seen other reviews say that the feminist message of the movie missed the mark since Kens aren't equal in Barbieland, I loved that part especially. In the same way that I don't like feminine trauma being graphically shoved in my face in a movie for the sake of a thinly veiled message, I think it also sucks when a movie takes *too* light of an approach because it's scared to actually say something. Of course the Kens aren't equal in Barbieland 1) Ken was literally invented as a boyfriend for Barbie because parents thought a single lady with a job was ""loose"" and 2) they are toys made by people, they are a product (lol) of their makers. So yes, Barbies are in charge, but Barbieland is just another world created by men and the ideology of misogyny (or any form of bigotry) states that someone can only be dominant if someone else is subservient.The audience in the theatre I was in seemed to feel the same way, because when the narrator said, ""Well, the Kens have to start somewhere. Eventually they'll have as much rights as women have in the real world."" I swear everyone was laughing. It really connected with the audience from what I saw. So many clever points were made in a nonsensical Barbie pink package and it was just perfect. If you made it this far on my review, you're going to have the best day ever today. And tomorrow. And the day after that. And every day from now until forever <3."
"The Barbie movie was unexpected. It was a colorful and clever ride in the cinema. I was not expecting all the deep emotions that the film gave. Life is not all about perfection, which a lot of people wants to constantly achieve these days, imperfections is what identifies us and that's okay.I'm a visual kind of cinema goer and I have the say that dance sequence (Dance the Night) and the scene where Barbie and Ken where traveling to the real world were AMAZING. Kudos to the creative team behind it, I absolutely adore the set.Greta Gerwig and her team delivered a visual spectacle with a heart."
"It's a satiric fantasy comedy based on the Barbie doll created in 1959. The film is set in a fantasy ""Barbieland"" and Southern California in the modern age.There are multiple Barbies and multiple Kens. Margot Robbie, Kate McKinnon, and Issa Rae are the most important Barbies. The most recognizable Kens are Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu. The plot, such as it is, initially features Stereotypical Barbie (Robbie) in a matriarchal Barbieland where Kens struggle for relevance and autonomy. However, Barbie begins to channel aspects of the ""real world"" of her original owner, and Weird Barbie (McKinnon) sends her to Southern California to engage her human connection. There she meets Gloria (America Ferrera) and her daughter, Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt). Barbie also encounters CEO (Will Ferrell) and Ruth (Rhea Perlman), the inventor of the Barbie doll.The film follows the adventures of Barbie (Robbie) and Ken (Gosling) in California and their response to the patriarchy they find in the real world. This patriarchy has implications for life in Barbieland when they return. Everything happily resolves in the end.I was frankly disappointed. There were genuinely amusing spots, but not the laugh-out-loud sequences mentioned by some reviewers. Robbie and Gosling are good with a thin script. ""Barbie"" is cotton candy feminism in support of a brand."
"From the get-go, Barbie hits hard with its spectacle and wit. The movie literally starts and ends itself in quips. But make no mistake, there is purpose and feeling to the film. It presents its core message boldly around its character's struggles, and subtly beneath its self-referential humor.I could best describe Barbie as the inaugural Marvel movie of Greta-Gerwig-involved projects. It has a fantastic ensemble all-star cast with added cameos you never saw coming. Dazzling VFX and detailed practical set pieces bring life to the most plastic aspects of Barbieland. At several points it not just breaks the fourth wall, but blows through it altogether. There is no moment where it won't reset your expectation about what will come next.There are definitely characters and relationships I would have liked to see explored more in-depth in the film. Regardless, Barbie will send you home with a profound motivation to re-explore who you are, where you're headed, who you want to be."
"Last year I was appointed to a department hiring committee for an important position. When a colleague asked me who else was on the committee, she scoffed at the gender composition. Even though our department is half women, the hiring committee was nearly all men. I hadn't noticed until she mentioned it. What else don't I notice?According to the philosopher Richard Rorty, art is better at changing minds than argument, because it allows the audience to see through someone else's eyes and empathize. In the Barbie movie, shortly after he arrives in the real world, Ken takes a walk through Century City in Los Angeles. Among the skyscrapers there are men in business suits, and a guy exiting a gym nods at him. A couple of guys jump out of a hummer, and policemen ride by on horses. A woman assistant is shushed by businessmen in important discussion. Finally there is a montage of men -- US presidents, movie stars, sports stars, stock traders, Mount Rushmore, and the portraits on US currency. Ken realizes that, unlike in Barbie's world, men hold the power in the real world. Ken learns to sing the 1996 Matchbox 20 hit Push, featuring the lyrics, ""I want to push your around, and I will, and I will."" When the song came out, it was my freshman year in high school. I must have heard it hundreds of times, but I never noticed that the lyrics hinted at violence against the singer's love interest. The film made me notice specific parts of American culture which I had absorbed growing up without thinking, and which reinforced the idea that men have the power in society.The film will work best for an American audience. Not only would it had hit less hard if I hadn't been forced to reevaluate the messages underlying parts of the culture I grew up with, but another wonderful aspect of the film was its send-ups of American films and popular music. The opening to 2001 is ported into the wonderful first minutes of the film. A bit later, a character makes Barbie choose between continuing her fantasy life (represented by a stilleto) and learning the truth (a birkenstock sandel). There is a great musical tribute to Take on Me (I know, a-ha is Norwegian, but it was a US hit!), and a power ballad that reminded me of Free Bird. Later in the film, Ken wears a faux mink coat that I'm sure I've seen on Logan Paul. I must have missed many more.It is surprising that Mattel signed off on the film, since it does a good job of presenting the good, the bad, and the weird of Barbie over the years. While she started out in a swimsuit, Barbies were sold in the getup of just about every profession. Girls could play with Barbie the surgeon, Barbie the scientist, or Barbie the politician, and maybe imagine themselves in those traditionally male roles. On the other hand, a teenage character points out that Barbie has given unrealistic body and beauty ideals to generations of women, and that Barbie promotes unhealthy consumer culture with all of her outfits and accessories. If nothing else, the color profile of Barbie is pink and glittery. The weird are all the discontinued barbies -- including ""Growing Up Skipper"", a doll with inflatable breasts.I nicked one star because of the constant product placement and the milquetoast feel-good ending. That said, the movie is worth your time. After years of copy-paste superhero movies and CGI spectacles, the Barbie movie gives me hope for a future of more thoughtful Hollywood blockbusters."
Interesting look at barbies world but maybe not enough pink 😂. Loved the musical numbers and the star studded cast who did not falter on their delivery. The unfortunate truth of the real world's Patriarchal society is laid out perfectly. Sound track was awesome especially Lizzo. Have to say fun to see all the pink outfits rolling into the cinemas not many icons can have this effect. Sex and the city excluded. Doesn't take itself too seriously and deffinetly falls into the comedy genre comfortably. Will Ferrell is a great addition although I word have liked to have seen more of him. In the end it is Barbie's world.
"The Barbie movie had a very easy going start with parties, colors, and making fun of stereotypes. It's all very musical-like untill Barbie asks the question about dying which can be seen in trailer.The movie slowly starts to take itself more seriously and when Barbie goes to the ""Real World"" she faces problems that modern woman has. Ken also has to face the ""Real World"" but does it in his own way. It was very cool seeing two characters detached from reality and having completely different view on the world face the ""reality"" and carry themselves with it. It makes the characters more fleshed out which the movie does well, as i've got a feeling that Barbie and Ken in particular are behaving just how they were imagined to since they were first made.Time and Change are factors that are actually displayed through small cameos and at the ending itself, but have a very important meaning and are factors that should be thought about after you watch the movie.Ultimately, the ""agenda"" goes from funny jokes to actual rants towards the end of the movie but it all comes a full circle and sends a strong message.The music and cinematography are very cartoonish and nice, so is the dialogue. The references to other media are very cleverly put throughout the movie as well. The dialogue at the beginning is made to look like kids actually playing with those dolls but facing the reality is actually a very good space for character development, and Barbie used that very good. Even tho some ""agendas"" are pushed throughout the movie, it ultimately sends a good message, and does what Barbie is supposed to do : to inspire girls and make them feel strong for who they are."
"The most fun I've had at the cinema in a long time. The jokes are meta and hilarious. The performances all through spectacular. This was like a fever dream and I can't wait to take all my friends to the cinema to watch this movie again and again. I did not expect to be so entertained but also shedding tears. A movie everyone should go and watch. And how beautiful that Billie Eilish song was! We will definitely hear it live next year at the Academy Awards, where I hope Greta and the whole team will get recognition for creating this (already) iconic film. Production design, script, directing, acting (especially Ryan bodied that role) and Best original song I would want to see awarded."
"The movie's first 30 minutes were amazing. It all goes downhill from there, with such a weak plot full of holes and contradicting characters. It could have been such a fun, light hearted movie and it did have a few good laughs but the movie was dark and confusing with characters like Will Ferrel and a teenaged girl that brought nothing to the film. America Ferrera's speech was depressing, not empowering and whatever the message was from this movie was muddled and lost on many, including on Barbie herself. There were definitely some people in the audience having a great time while the other half remained quiet and confused including the Moms with their little girls who were duped by the amazing marketing campaign which said this movie was for EVERYONE. The Barbie film is not for kids which is an oxymoron considering this is a kids' doll and Mattel even released a Barbie toy line to go with the film. The movie is also not for women like me who loved playing Barbies. All I could think of while watching Will Ferrell in a dumb superfluous role was why couldn't they make a solid movie like the Lego movie with the amazing set of Barbieland and the great actors they hired? And why did they make Ken the star of the Barbie movie? He really saved the film even if I was falling asleep by the time we got to his musical number. I honestly don't know who the target audience is for this movie, maybe overgrown children in their 20s and 30s who find 2 hour long movies about the patriarchy and matriarchy fun and interesting? I don't know but I was happy when it ended and then confused when the credits rolled and showed pictures of Moms and their little girls because this movie was NOT made for them."
"When I watched the trailer for the first time, I wasn't sure if I would want to watch the movie, but all the great marketing and internet hype made me excited so I watched it, and I couldn't be happier! I have to say that at least every girl should watch this movie!!!The representation of girls ""in a man's world"" and the difference between a fantasy and the reality are shown greatly, but apart from that, the movie and the script just carry such a powerful message towards women that should be heard. When I went out of the cinema, I felt so empowered and self-confident!Kudos to Greta Gerwig and her entire team for creating such a vital movie for women.Another important fact is that the actors and actresses absolutely nailed it!!! Margot Robbie played her role so well, I was actually convinced she was Barbie, and Ryan Gosling had the absolute best facial expressions. I enjoyed watching them sooo much. Worthy to mention is also the awesome work of the other actors and actresses: THEY WERE ALL AMAZING!!! Whoever did the casting for this movie should get a raise. Everybody managed to portray their characters so well!!!One of my favorite scenes was the fight between the Kens because of how realistic the actors played it!And the costumes and decorations/houses should also be acknowledged. I watched the Dreamhouse Tour on YouTube and I appreciated all the detail so much! Barbie's cowboy costume was the banger, I think that was my favourite fit from the entire movie.And the music!!! ""I'm just Ken"" is still stuck in my head, and whenever it comes on shuffle, I scream to it dramatically. :) But it's not only this song, I keep listening to the Barbie Album on Spotify because all the songs are so catchy!!!I really want to rewatch this movie!!! It's a solid 10/10 from me. :) (I'm a girl, btw, if you couldn't tell xD.)"
"Firstly, whoever rates this movie below 10 is an empty man or a woman without sense of sensitivity and beauty. This film depicts the harsh truth women must live with, which is that this is "" a man's world"". Not a very pleasant fact when your nature gravitates towards unity, happiness, femininity, not war and power. However, the ending is inspiring and masking the saddening patriarchal reality we are trapped into, therefore you don't leave the cinema being depressed.Thank you Greta Gerwig, how much the little girl in me needed the comfort this masterpiece offers, i cannot put into words. Being a woman can be ""very Barbie"" with the right mindset and sanity but in this life's busyness you need a reminder sometimes.Thank you to every person who put an effort into creating this 2 hour lesson."
"I am not a huge Barbie fan. I want to say that right out of the gate. My mom, however, has a massive collection. She was at just the right age when the dolls came out that Barbie was a huge part of her life. Knowing that, I took her to see Barbie yesterday morning.Parents of young children, there's nothing majorly inappropriate going on but you may want to wait on this one. While it's visually stunning, I wouldn't call it a kids movie. There are lots of complex themes woven into it that younger kids may not understand.Production design is stellar! In scenes where some of the infamous Barbie dream house is involved, the props behave just like Barbie toys do. It's a subtle reminder that the team understood the assignment & did not disappoint.The costume design is also amazing. There are joking references to costumes that were discontinued that fans of the toy line will enjoy. The end credits also do a great job of referencing deep cuts in the Barbie lineup.Diversity is on full display here & it works to the film's advantage. Girls & women watching this film will find a Barbie that looks like them. And gents, they didn't forget you either. There are also diverse Kens in Barbieland. In fact, I'm going to have trouble watching Kingsley Ben-Adir in Secret Invasion as Gravik, because he makes a great Ken. The whole point is representation. Barbie can be anything. The movie does a great job of driving that home.The marketing mentioned if you loved Barbie or hated Barbie, this is the movie for you. It doesn't shy away from Barbie's detractors. Gloria's daughter delivers a scathing referendum on Barbie's impact on society. But later on Gloria delivers a monologue that had my whole theater cheering when she finished. As a middle aged woman, I related to everything she said. I didn't find it preachy as some have said. It felt heartfelt & reflective of what most women deal with every single day.It's fun. At times, it's plain old goofy. The dance numbers are on point. I don't know what I was expecting but I walked out of the theater still chuckling.It's okay to revel in the fun of it. It's okay to dive into the deeper themes. There were tons of ""Barbies"" & ""Kens"" in my theater, wearing their favorite shade of pink, be it subtle or neon. The fans are all in & even a reluctant movie goer like me can get on board. Lots of laughs with enough real world to make it relatable. One of the better movies I've seen in a very long time.No post credits sequences."
"Iconic. The set, the outfits, the decor, the styling was iconic. I loved that the words and tones they used were as if a child was playing with them, but the topics were more serious and meaningful. They gave such a creative and fun spin to everything. I had many moments where I thought ""how did they even come up with all of this"". I like to be positively surprised in a movie and the conversations and jokes were so fun and fitting to the movie and the vibe, everything was well thought of and I could not help but smile every time. It's very extravagant and light and fun. It's not a movie for people who like deep dialogues and dramatic emotions in films. It is meant to be easy to digest, fun, extra and make you smile. I find it a brilliant concept and a refreshing, lightweight movie. I loved it. Very Girly and fun.In one word: iconic."
"The barbie movie is AMAZING. Like perfect cast, amazing references. Like Taylor swift level of references and Easter eggs. It's so clear that it's been made by women (or majority women) all departments, everywhere I hope it wins awards. I've never felt this way for a movie before but it defs was hyped up for a reason. It's a barbie movie made for everyone but it's not like a typical barbie movie (which I still love) it's so much more, once I heard Billie eilishes new song I knew it was gonna be GOOD and in depth with its story line and it was. The whole team and makers of this movie hit the nail on the head. It's genuinely become my favourite movie."
"This film has certainly grabbed the headlines and produced some very positive reviews which encouraged us to see for ourselves. We were a little disapointed in the end. Whilst it was watchable and had it's humerous moments, we somehow expected more from it. It's very much in the mould of a Hollywood film with lots of obvious cliches. There were quite a few teenage girls in the cinema with their mothers, which could be the ones who enjoy this film the most. It's been described as a 'fun' film by many, which I can understand. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling play their parts well and add to the charm of the film. I would hesitate to recommend this, other than to youngsters or 'young at hearts' who love Barbie dolls and want see a fun film with lots of pink sparkle."
"I had high expextations for this Movie: Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, Perfect Casting, Ryan Gosling and then the First Trailer: Our hopes for this beeing something special were high. Yesterday, I saw the movie. It was so great, just so great, My God. Ken is just it. He is just it. Kenough said. You Just Need to buy a ticket, or two and go See it. Some people might Not understand the Movie, maybe your friends or family sitting next to you dont like it. But that is okay. Because you Just wittnessed something special, a historic moment in movie history and you felt it. You know it for sure. And then Barbie ends and all you want to do is Watch it again. Thank you for Making this movie. I will treasure it forever. Thank you, it was so much fun. This is the kend of My Review."
"This movie is nothing like I expected AND I LOVE IT. Greta strikes again with the best combo of comedy and drama. I laughed, I almost cried and it was just the best experience.Having moments when I just loved seeing the interpretation of the Barbie world, moments that shocked me of how well they described the patriarchy even through jokes, the moments showing the women maturing and growing up that almost made me cry. There was nothing I didn't love about this movie and I can't stress this enough.Overall, this movie made me fell more empowered and confident than ever and I wish that everyone could have the same experience that I did."
"Every one - man and woman, should watch this movie with an open-mind and introspection about current society. Barbie was one of the most real, complex, insightful, trippiest, thoughtful, and educational videos I've watched in a long time. This movie is not for everyone and is definitely not designed for kids due to the much deeper meaning. To get the full experience of the art of the movie, you have to ready to focus and peel all the symbolic layers.I came in expecting a lighthearted, fun, and silly movie like how you expect the stereotypical Barbie brand. But the movie brought so much more depth and substance. Be ready for a rollercoaster of emotions!"
"The Barbie movie was a fun movie that lacked a little bit in plot, but was overall a hilarious movie to watch. While many people out there seem to hate this movie for empowering women and taking down men, they are looking at it the wrong way, they movie gave an in depth tour into all the common stereotypes set on women and men and intensified them to show their true meanings and how people can become affected by them, all while keeping the Barbie theme at the heart of the plot. It addressed and took down many of the common stereotypes and truly exposed the reality of society for what it really is, a patriarchy, which isn't necessarily a bad thing however the movie is sure to make clear that women should and can have a more equal presence in ""powerful"" positions in society."
"Went to the Wednesday Barbie Blow Out showing - I went into it thinking it was going to be a cute charming movie. It wasn't anything I expected, I've never seen a movie like this before, on all levels from writing, the sets. Every actor has such amazing range. The way each scene transformed your mind set, having you want more. This movie was so good It was written with current, real issues while also being nostalgic and filled with Easter eggs, while giving ode to the past and so self aware. The writers and actors perfectly put into a scene the struggles, heartache, dissonance into everyday life, while making you cry of both laughter and sadness."
"In Barbieland, Stereotypical Barbie, played by Margot Robbie, experiences changes both mentally and physically, much to the surprise of the other Barbies. To find the answers she is looking for, Stereotypical Barbie must venture out into the real world, accompanied by her Ken, played by Ryan Gosling. On the plus side, the production design is striking. Barbieland is visually interesting, managing to feel fake, but lived in at the same time. The actors seem to have fun in the roles they are playing, Ryan Gosling's Ken being a stand out, making the best of the material he has. Margot Robbie also fulfills the role at playing a believable Barbie. Unfortunately, the overall execution of the film was disappointing. Most of the humor didn't land for me, though it did have its moments. Then there is the mixed messaging regarding gender roles. The film clearly states what it is trying to say (not subtle at all), but at the same time, undermines it through poor writing and characterization. Likewise, other attempts for the story to get deep end up falling flat by getting in its own way. While Barbie has its moments, it ends up getting held back by poorly executed ideas. Final verdict: 5/10."
""" Barbie "", fulfilling the expectations of our childhood dreams.This is the first live-action Barbie movie adaptation based on Mattel's Barbie fashion doll. Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, who go on a journey of self-discovery following an existential crisis.Shimmery pink in the dream world while Barbie and her friends placed lovingly. Barbie Land features detailed replicas at a specific scale to look like life-size toy dolls. The clothes, furnitures, dream house, and background of the movie set are all designed to look like the original toy. Barbie Land's construction almost entirely uses an enchanting pink colour.Greta Gerwig as a director neatly wraps up the complex issues faced by women in society in a fun and easily accessible way.Barbie itself is a representation of all women's hopes and desires to be anything they want, including the right to live free from violence and discrimination, to be educated, to own property, and to vote. In Barbie Land, women rule the worlds.Barbie's casting choices have a specific quality. Barbie's Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling obviously looks perfect. Margot Robbie is a living doll, her face and posture are perfect to play the role of Barbie. Although, Ryan Gosling steals the whole show. Ken looks fun to hang out with.The entire soundtrack of the Barbie movie is very meaningful and upbeat."
"As expected ""Barbie"" is A lot of happy fun! 💕 Greta Gerwig is a director I've really come to appreciate & LOVE. Greta is one of the most wholesome filmmakers working today. ""Lady bird"" is my favourite coming of age story in film and similarly, I have to say right off the bat-this film is ridiculously hilarious. Tongue and cheek? Sure. Just exceptionally written characters also. The quirks between Margot Robbie (Barbie) & Ryan Gosling (Ken) are just magic together on screen.Margot is probably the only person to have played ""Barbie"" as she is so perfect in the role with everything she does. Mr Gosling (KEN) is eating up all the screen time and will also have you gasping for air at some of his one liners and facial expressions.I should mention that Issa Rae & America Ferrera are just so awesome a-swell in this world. Now! Having grown up in the 90s and seeing how popular the toys were, I was apart of the ""Barbie"" crazed era in primary school. It's really cool knowing everyone has another summer blockbuster coming that they can be truely excited about. Really hope that everyone can give ""Barbie"" a chance, because it has a lot of HEART.Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" is nothing more then a delightful trip down memory lane, filled with what felt like a stellar cast and production value. Furthermore this film was filled with outstanding characters, dance choreography and musical numbers."
"So hilarious and intelligently written. The writers sincerely can't be credited enough with how smart and funny this movie is. It's the kind of movie you can watch over and over and find new jokes, there's just so many! If you're uptight about the way many women feel how they ""fit into"" society, then this movie may not be for you. But, you're missing out. I hope the academy finally starts recognizing comedies. It's so much more difficult to write something funny and be an actor that can pull of true comedy than drama. It just is. You have to be new, creative and intelligent. Dramas, you can just play things that people automatically get emotional about, It's so hard to figure out what many will find funny, yet alone hilarious. The Academy should nominate Gosling (sp?) for best actor, Robbie for best actress, the move for best screen play and movie. It was just so creative and funny. Loved it, and honestly, I thought I'd hate it."
"This movie is absolutely amazing! It totally makes you think about the current society and what we really do prioritise and favour. Went into it without knowing what sort of angle they would take, and I was so extremely surprised and pleased with how Greta has done this. I can truthfully say I had a smile on my face for most of the movie, however there was times where tears were also shed due to the meaning of the film. Casting was a brilliant choice, Margot was the perfect fit for Barbie and Ryan a great Ken. Also want to mention that America and Kate did awesome jobs with their characters. A must watch, possibly best movie of the year!"
"Barbie movie is a comedy which is based on absurd plot twists and things which happen throughout the film. It offers many laughs and has a lot of hidden jokes which add up to a great movie. I was worried there would be much too many musical scenes, but after watching it I believe they were put there with good reason and in just the right places. The whole scene nearing the end of the film (I won't spoil anyhting, don't worry) was just so well done, I loved that the play on women-male dynamics was very lighthearted, but just serious enough. There is apsolutely no men-bashing.The Ken's were put in the women's places from the Real World and men in the theatres watching saying that the movie is 'too feminist' and is 'men-bashing' are failing to see their hypocrisy."
"A confused, misfiring, tedious and pretentious affair. I was expecting much better, yet ultimately disappointed. Margot Robbie (and to a lesser extent, Ryan Gosling) is very good, but otherwise even she can't save this twaddle. Don't listen to the critics - it is crap!Pros: the opening scene apeing '2001 a Space Odyssey' was funny.Cons:
It needed better editing to create a more coherent structure
It had very dull patches (despite the pink)
The emphasis on the 'patriarchy' was definitely laid on too thick
Will Ferrell was not funny in this. He needs to really understand that whatever comes out of his mouth is not necessarily instant comedy gold.Avoid!!!!!"
"With movies like Everything Everywhere All At Once and Beau Is Afraid having come out recently, Barbie is the next in a line of a clearly developing trend of absurdism, meta commentary, and surrealism to create a wacky, funny, beautiful, and touching film about some type of social commentary. With Barbie, we get commentary on feminism, consumerism, and existentialism. It leans perfectly into its brightly colored world and plasticky fakeness to help elevate its commentary and rich cast. The costume, makeup, and set design are lavishly created and I wouldn't be surprised if it won Oscars for all of these categories. The cast does a fantastic job, and I don't think there could have been a better Ken or Barbie. Greta Gerwig was always going to make this more than just a family movie. It's a feminist masterpiece chock full of over the top pop culture nods, perfectly timed comedic quips, and genuine emotional moments that make you think."
"The movie is entertaining, funny and it does touches on more serious topics, there is times that it feels that those topics are too on the face and can ruin the passing but is rarely noticeable.The way that the characters evolution is natural and interesting and I can sympathise with a lot of the characters.Is a fun movie and making a Barbie movie a pg13 is a really risky but innovative way of representing this iconic character
Is also really important to notice that the movie because of its nature is going to cause a lot of polarisation and hate, I think that the movie could have been more subtle on delivering the ideology but I understand why they didn't do it."
"Barbie it's not just a movie about some dolls and perfection. This movie says a lot about everything. In the first seconds of it I thought there wouldn't be something meaningful. I thought it would be some fun movie just to chill while you're watching it. But this movie is a lot more than just fun. With this movie we can see ourselves in it. It shows how powerful women are. But also how hard it is to be a woman. And not just that. Also our childhood. The barbieland is our childhood. Peaceful, enjoying life. But when it's our time to leave it, it's scary and new because that's the adult life. The finale scene shows us that to live is the most beautiful thing we can experience. And some people are stereotypical barbies who don't know how to live their life in the most human way. We are here to smile, cry and improve ourselves. But sometimes we get lost and need to find ourselves again. It's a cycle that we need to go through. This movie represents a lot of things not just one. And I think everyone who watches that film can find a different meaning."
"This is the kind of movie I want my teenage daughter to grow up watching. To get to know and appreciate the flaws, strengths, and weaknesses that come with being a woman, whatever it is, 'Because Barbie can be anything, WE can be anything'.I expected the movie Barbie to be about the origin of Barbie or about Barbie's adventures like most other Barbie animated movies, but it turned out to be much more than that. It really explores the value of empowering women, which is typical of Greta Gerwig.I really enjoyed the first half of the film, mainly because of the beautiful scenery, colorful colors, and Barbieland. I was also surprised by how gorgeous Margot Robbie looks as Barbie, and the costumes and set designs are so beautiful. As the movie progresses, I realized that this movie will become more profound and emotional, and Ryan Gosling is fantastic as Ken, handsome, funny, and energetic. Even though Ken is ""Kenough,"" the film does not ignore the role of men, and we love Allan. The movie is a bit dull at times, and some of the jokes are cringey, but it's still enjoyable to watch to the end.I think the best part of the movie is the ending, when Barbie talks to Ruth in a really meaningful way. It's really touching and uplifting, with a really thoughtful message about womanhood and self-love.Barbie (2023) might not be perfect and it might not be everyone's favorite, but hey, nothing's perfect, right?-@fineapplespov."
"A pink lovers dream really,I sat down at this film with nothing but open mindedness and a slight sense of uncomfortableness as being one of the few men in seated at the showing.However leaving this film I was filled with a great sense of joy, a near two hour course of fun, laughter and adult themes to make this a great film. Could a child watch this for the sake of it purely being Barbie? Yes. Could an adult enjoy this and understand the true meanings of the film? Yes!Without giving any spoilers away Greta Gerwig delivers a fun filled adventure with mature enough themes to open the eyes of many film goers to see what is really out there happening in todays world and this a pure reflection of that formatted in a way that all can enjoy.A seemingly fully invested enable cast bring the life and soul to this film, Gosling seemingly carrying this film on his back and Margot's performance was also good enough.The cinematography and stage design for this was exactly how you would imagine and provide a great backdrop to this film, The musical numbers and art style were in complete sync boosting the film to wild heights.Some tough, touching and some frankly weird scenes (The very end) left me feeling great overall and its certainly a film I would see again and one I would recommend."
"This movie is a feminist fever dream that teaches young girls that they will never be successful in the world as long as men exist, and that men are horrible, ironically Ken played by Ryan Gosling is the best part of this movie, bringing more laughs than anything else.The movie gets upset at the real world because women don't choose to take on more physical or stressful jobs, and then says that the reason they don't take these jobs is because of men, Men are this men are that, men publicly grope women, every single one, and every woman is perfect no matter how obese or weird they are. It's a waste of time for anyone not watching the movie Ironically, go watch Oppenheimer instead."
"Very good movie Ryan acting is very nice also Margarot . I haven't totally watched this movie but anyway it's good upto I saw this.greta gerwig movies always good movies this film is also not exceptional from that she maintained her touch.coming to talk about screenplay gerwig and her husband Noah their combo both are legendary directors their combo is good not only his personal life but also in silver screen.ryan gosling is rarely do these type characters most of his movies he delivers same expression, thinking about his acting I am not fan for him but I like Margarot I am a big fan for her role Harley Quinn."
"This movie made me laugh, and cry. It was a beautiful commentary on sexism and the patriarchy and how it affects little girls, while still poking fun at it all. It also spreads a really inspiring message about mothers. I personally wouldn't show this movie to a child TOO young as there are a few jokes about how barbie's don't have genitals, one bleeped f word, and a few mentions of beer. It was a LITTLE depressing, but overall very inspirational. Despite, of course, the discussion of misogyny, I laughed through the whole thing. It was hilarious. It addressed also how adult women/mothers feel self conscious about not being perfect. It was beautiful and I'd watch again."
"I watched this movie expecting something else, but after the movie was finished I was not expecting so much humor, emotional rollercoasters, and a lot of Barbies with Kens. The last scene where Barbie wants to be a human had me almost in tears. I felt different in the heart as well. The soundtrack was also amazing as well. I just wish that there could be more Barbies for like everyday life that we go through and maybe it can get more sales. If not ""Blame Mattel"" lol. The Mattel jokes had me laughing every time they were brought up. I couldn't have asked for a better comedy movie for the summer."
"I went into Barbie with no expectations, only hopes that it would be entertaining, even if the intended audience is pretty young. Well, I was wrong about the age of the intended audience because obviously the intended audience is me and my fellow 80's babies/90's teens! I absolutely loved it and definitely entertained. I laughed, got teary eyed, and even cheered at times. Margot Robbie shined, Ryan Gosling gave me a new perspective on Ken, and the costumes dazzled. The themes, jokes, and one-liners were actually pretty insightful. Barbie Movie is not all pretty fluff and makeup. It's the MOMENT."
I LOVED THE BARBIE MOVIE. It was very empowering and encouraging to young girls then ending is unexpected and kind of sad but the movie did not disappoint I was worried it wasn't gonna live up to the expectations but it exceed the expectations I want to watch it again and again I also love the marketing for this movie it deserves a higher rating. I hope there's a part 2 going into more detail so we get even more context about the choices and decisions or a continuation of the ending I also loved how they put the original barbie creator and inspiration for barbie that was a nice touch But it needed nicki minaj.
"Barbie is a film with undeniably gorgeous production design and distinct visual charm, and it's at its best when it embraces its surreal absurdist humor and runs with it. This has some of the funniest sequences of the year.Robbie, Gosling, and most of the rest of the cast have impeccable comedic timing. The line delivery is somehow both dry and full of energy.The world that the story presents is gleefully ridiculous and when it fully leans into this tone, it's wonderful.The problems arise when the script fluctuates wildly (and frequently) between goofy dumb comedy and heavy-handed social messaging. It's jarring and often seems to be treating us, the audience, like we're stupid.The script is so heavy-handed in presenting a shallow view of the world and reductionist view of both men and women, yet is seemingly so convinced of its intelligence and wit.A caricatured world is all good and fun, but it's not exactly conducive to making a commentary on incredibly nuanced issues.Thankfully, the film sort of figures out how to balance all of this by its final minutes, and it really does have a knockout ending.There's a lot to love here. It's just kinda messy in delivering the good stuff."
"In Greta's ""Barbie,"" the iconic doll takes on real-world problems in this comedy-meets-existential film, transforming from a seemingly superficial figure to a multi-dimensional character. Through physical and emotional challenges, Barbie discovers the true strength that comes from within, while the movie skillfully balances humor with deeper existential questions. As her journey unfolds, Barbie's exploration of empathy and self-discovery resonates profoundly with audiences, reminding them of the significance of creative freedom in cinema. The film's portrayal of Barbie's evolution from a controversial symbol to a beacon of empowerment becomes a captivating exploration of womanhood and the enduring spirit of femininity."
So good but the only part I don't like is the scene when the boys take over the town apart from that it's perfect. Barbie is a heartwarming family movie with great actors and a great freaking plot. Its my favorite movie and its highly recommended for a family but there some bad words like vagina and penis. I think it should be recommended for 12 and over. The rating 12A (12 adult ) and it is 1h and 54m. If u don't like comedy movies ( I'm sure u like comedy's) than this movie is not for u. Thank u all for reading this review and I hope u read my other reviews. (By the way my reviews have spoilers)
"Like I said, this movie is just chef's kiss. It's funny, airy but also has a deep meaning when us women can relate to. I have never felt so understood watching the movie and I hope that men will learn to understand it as well. Honestly the movie brought me to tears, especially the end. The music, cast, script and the acting were perfection.Also the character Alan is so underrated. Alan represents all the men that don't take part of the problem. He stands with Barbie even though all the Ken's stood against her.When I saw this movie I could feel all of us were united. This movie represents us, what it's like being a women and how it feels to be a women.Thank you for showing everyone how this world works."
"First of all, please can we all hail Ryan Gosling for the stellar performance of Beach Ken. I had reservations as he is older than I would have picked for that role but hot damn does he give it his all and it pays off. Genuinely Oscar worthy stuff. Also can we also all appreciate how good the song ""I'm Just Ken"" is!The first half of the film is absolute Barbie magic in all of its glory. Second half wasn't quit as strong but as a 20's female that has struggled a little with deciding who/what I want to be, this hit a surprising emotional spot for me. I think behind all the glitter and silly fun, it has quite a good message. I must admit that it was cleverly done.My only real criticism is the film appears mostly targeted at a young audience when anyone under 10 probably wouldn't grasp the plot and messaging of the movie.For anyone not really vibing with the marketing for this movie, definitely give it a chance! It's better than expected."
"This movie was so emotionally moving in a way that I didn't expect at all. I loved how critically it evolves around the Barbie and Ken figure and questions everything you ever took for granted in a very nice and intelligent way. I absolutely loved this movie and would watch it again any time.I sobbed for most half of the movie, at the end it comes down to why it's important to be a human and not trying to be perfect.The cast was also amazing. Great acting. Almost all of the cast of sex education is in it which was really cool to see. I would totally recommend this movie to anyone, even if you don't like or didn't play with Barbie."
"Greta Gerwig has had a hit or miss career. Her film Little Women was fairly entertaining, but I found her film Lady Bird to be completely obnoxious. Same goes for Margot Robbie. I enjoyed her in Wolf Of Wall Street and Once Upon a Time In Hollywood, but really disliked I Tonya and Birds of Prey.Now comes Barbie, based on the long running series of dolls from Mattel. Now as a guy, I never played with Barbies prefering to play video games over dolls, however my sisters enjoyed playing them and that's the question about this film. Who is the target audience for this film? Because on one hand it looked like a film designed for sixty year old women who never got over playing with their dolls and on another hand, its advertising is aimed at little girls even though some of the material maybe offensive to a lot of families.The plotline, which is extremely thin, involves Barbie living the perfect life in Barbieland where Barbie dolls of all types live and where all the Kens hang out at the beach, Then all of a sudden Barbie escapes to the real world where she is treated like a dog really hammering home Greta Gerwig's misandry.I can see this film having a decent opening weekend but expect it to drop like a rock in the following weeks when people realize this film is really just a one trick pony. The pink sets look nice but the screenplay and the annoying script are definitely going to divide audiences and this film really doens't have mainstream appeal at all. Most of all Will Farrel as the CEO of Mattel is about as annoying as ever and the misanderyt stereotypes are about entertaining as watching paint dry.A one on a scale of 1-10. Save yourself the headache and see the much better Oppenheimer instead!"
"For sure would be better rated if there weren't so many insecure men missing the entire point of the movie, or rejecting it because it is not the same old narrative that has favoured only them until now. I don't think is ""too preachy"" as other comments say. Is an important message that needs to be tackled more to have a more fair society maybe one day. Even ignoring the message, it had a good comedic approach to not just be depressed by the reality it shows, had great music, good acting, creativity, good visuals, all in all great movie. I like that it didn't have a typical love story ending, which would have ruined the whole point of the movie. A fresh movie that is needed."
"We saw a pre-screening of the Barbie movie last night. I loved the walk down memory lane and some new facts about the history of Barbie scattered through the film. There were great messages around what feminism really is but also how when one gender holds all the power it's not a good balance. The actors were brilliant and Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken was just perfection. Margot Robbie made the perfect ""stereotypical"" Barbie but took us on an emotional ride of discovery. All in all it was an enjoyable movie with a great script. Great for Barbie fans and anyone who has a connection to Barbie from their childhoods!"
"I think Greta Gerwig perfectly threaded the needle between astute social commentary on Barbie, and a love letter to the doll that shaped America. It is a campy oasis in the midst of an industry that seems to increasingly worship somber realism. It has all the charm of an 80s cult classic, on a 2023 budget. Alongside hilarious writing that made my cheeks hurt by the end, is incredible set and costume design, and standout acting performances from a remarkably cohesive cast. There are also subtle details I really appreciated like Barbie's car being a 1959 corvette, the same year the doll was released. I'll knock one star off because in a few moments towards the end, the plot gets lost in itself, and it feels like they are speaking in riddles."
"Actually incredible!!This film made me laugh, smile & cry.It has an amazing deeper meaning that many people overlook
& The cast in this film are sooo talented!!It has an amazing soundtrack featuring artists like Charlie xcx, tame impala & lizzo!I would recommend this film for tweens+ since anyone younger wouldn't probably understand the concept of the film.Here are a few of my fav moments (spoilers)weird barbieAllanthe cellulite jokeswhen the Barbies got their power backI'm just Ken & all the other songsbarbie & Ruththe (real) home videosthe jokes against the patriarchyThat's all :)"
"For a movie about a line of plastic dolls, it managed to be the most deeply human movie to come out in a while. I've don't think that I've walked out of theater at the end of a movie with the feeling of so much solidarity with the folks around me and I'm already trying to make a plan for seeing it again in theaters.From the huge amount of artists work that went into making intricate sets that had the feeling of big Broadway ensemble stage pieces to the soundtrack, I can't say enough good things about this movie. Go see it, take your teenagers or your mom, but Greta Gerwig went and made something really special."
"I went to see this knowing nothing and exspecting nothing. I was confused with the reference to 1001 Space Odyssey at the beginning but was thrilled with our introduction to the Barbie World. It was a feast for the eyes and a blast from the past. It brought back my childhood make believe adventures with the dolls. Margot Robbie was perfect casting for Barbie. She believably naive without being stupid. I was laughing out loud. I was thrilled with the music and dance numbers. Ryan Gosling's Ken was also adorable. It's when they enter ""the real world"" that things go terribly wrong. Every character outside Barbieland is portrayed in a juvenile manner that made it hard to watch. Then the story just fell apart. It reminded me of a bad SNL sketch where the writers had a great idea but didn't know how to land the punch line or end the skit. I really felt that having the Barbies manipulate the men into going to war to regain control of Barbieland reeked of misogyny. If this had been a play I would have walked out at intermission. I'm really shocked that Mattel let their named be used. If this movie had just stayed in Barbieland and explored more of how the dolls ""live"" I would have given this a 10."
"I went to see Barbie with the highest of expectations and it did not disappoint.At times the whole movie theatre was laughing out loud. It was a beautiful experience to share. And there was even clapping at the end.It does not matter if you are young or old, a man or a woman, this is a movie you will enjoy.Do yourself a favor: leave your judgements aside and go watch it.Brief disclaimer: it is Barbie. It does touch on some controversial issues; considering Barbie always has been a female stereotype. It touches on the place of the woman in the world, the patriarchy, etcetera. I was not prepared for that and I do have some strong personal opinions on the topic itself. That being said: everything was so beautifully done and told and funny I seriously cannot complain about it. I honestly really enjoyed it."
"The first 5 min 👌🏽!!!Not a second of the movie looses your attention, it makes you think, laugh and even got a little tear out. It's full of irony and sarcasm, visually amazing. The level of detail on the toys, clothes, etc!!If you think it's just a feminist movie, give it a chance, if your smart enough to understand and read into the details, it will make you se a different perspective on what's feminism actually mean.I don't think it's inappropriate for kids however, they have to be certain age to understand the movie!This is already pop culture icon, hopefully opening minds in every generation!"
"You will experience vast emotions during this film. It's a thrill to watch, funny and fresh comedy. If I had any critiques for the film, I'd put them, but I enjoyed watching and will rewatch it. I felt like a little kid again at the movies. Totally absorbed with the story. It's a fictional land, while the film is so raw. Margot Robbie is a joy to watch and showed an impressive performance. I believed she was Barbie. The movie is played out as if the characters are dolls being played with. I imagined being a kid with my dolls, thinking of similar outrageous plots, dialogue, and wardrobe changes. Anyone can enjoy this film."
"I went into this movie thinking it would be a mature twist on the classical Barbie figure and the 'ideal' life of Barbie & Ken, as Barbie related content is usually known for.I was however quite surprised with the depth of the themes in this movie. The themes of gender equality and femininity were touched on in a very observant and interesting fashion, not necessarily pushing any agenda but instead giving the viewer their own opportunity to make their mind up and think a bit. Despite the serieus themes, the movie is very funny and gives a lot of big and small nudges to the Barbie franchise and history. It's remarkably weird at times, but in a good way.The acting by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is great, as well as by a lot of the side characters. The set designs are also amazingly done and give the movie a nice feel. The audience was very hyped up and clapped or screamed on multiple occasions, improving the cinema experience on our visit at the opening night as well.Would definitely recommend a cinema viewing!"
"I saw Barbie yesterday with four women friends. We didn't know what to expect, but we all loved the movie! The writing was amazing. The acting was perfect. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were a great team. The music and dancing was truly entertaining. I actually cared about the characters, all the Barbies, all the Kens, as well as the mother and daughter in the ""real"" world. Will Ferrell was at his peak comedically. I also appreciated the overlay of politics, for those who are so inclined. I plan to see it again. I think more men should see it, as it treats men with compassion, humor and hope."
"I was thinking that Barbie was going to be a light hearted family movie.....it is not. You don't want to take the kids to this movie. I mean that was probably obvious from the trailer, casting and vibe. But if you were looking for a fun movie to take you away from the everyday heaviness...this is not that movie. If you want eye candy and lots of posturing and narrative sequences, then this movie is for you....otherwise I'd say don't go. Greta Gerwigs third directorial outing could have been so much more....sadly it does not live up to the hype. I just don't understand why they can't seem to make enjoyable movies that transport you away anymore."
"I was VERY excited to see Barbie and I expected SO much. I feel like I got more of the unexpected, and less of what I expected, though I don't really know what I expected.Songs...
I loved the mix of already existing songs and customed songs for this movie. I adored Billie Eilishs song What Was I Made For, it was so touching.The fighting scene with all the Kens at the beach was ridiculously amazing, and Ryan Gosling has never looked better, hehe. I loved the choreography in that big space with blue and pink, Ken Can. Music was 10/10.Emotion...
When Barbie saw what the real world was like I felt tears running down my face, I was so hurt by the truth. I mean, not even in this Barbie movie, we can forget about the unfair world for women. But without it, the movie wouldn't be as great.A big part of the movie was emotional and I thought that was great. When they talked about death, I really felt it.Overall, the movie was way more than I thought it would be and I definitely recommend it. The humor isn't hilarious but I chuckled when jokes were relatable."
"I'm sorry if there are some mistakes in this, english isn't my first language. This is seriously one of the funniest movies i've ever watched. I laughed everytime Ryan Gosling was on screen, he was my favorite in this movie. The only thing i would say wasn't the absolute best was the storyline. I felt like it was like 3 stories all in one movie and they shifted to those stories really fast. I did like the feminist vibe because it was all without hating on men. I think this would be a perfect movie for everyone. In my theater it was mostly young females tho, but i don't think it's made only for them!"
"First of all its Barbie , it's fun and pink .And I loved how they portrayed Ken, because I have to admit i had lots of Barbies but only one Ken and was always the bad guy . Kind of feel sorry for himAnyway the movie , it hits different right into my feelings. Especially the song what was I made for.It's a fun movie with some fun musical numbers ( I am just Ken ) and its nostalgic all those different Barbies , in there Barbieland with there dreamhouses.The costume design was great , simple but also retro like Barbies gingam dress with the 50's shapeThe 80's roller skating outfitsIt's all great."
"Barbie movies have always been an embodiment of women empowerment and creativity in the Barbie beautifully continues this tradition. With its captivating storyline and empowering messages, this animated gem is a delightful treat for both kids and adults alike.The film follows Barbie, a strong and determined young woman who embarks on a magical journey. What sets this movie apart is how it showcases Barbie's resilience and intelligence, proving that women can be brave leaders and problem-solvers. Throughout the adventure, Barbie's creativity shines, as she devises innovative solutions to challenges, challenging the stereotype of her being just a fashion icon.The movie is a visual feast, with vibrant colors and mesmerizing landscapes that transport the audience into the enchanting world of Barbie. Each character is thoughtfully designed, presenting diverse personalities that encourage individuality and self-expression.Beyond the captivating visuals, ""Babie"" also excels in its empowering themes. The film emphasizes the importance of teamwork and friendship, highlighting that by supporting each other, individuals can achieve great feats. This uplifting message resonates with young audiences, teaching them the significance of cooperation and unity in the face of adversity.Furthermore, the movie challenges traditional gender roles, showcasing male and female characters working together as equals, dismantling stereotypes and promoting gender inclusivity. Barbie herself serves as an exemplary role model, demonstrating that women can be both compassionate and assertive, nurturing and strong, and capable of being leaders in their own right.Overall, ""Barbie"" triumphs in promoting women empowerment and creativity within the Barbie universe. It inspires its audience to believe in themselves, embrace their uniqueness, and pursue their dreams fearlessly. The film's positive representation of strong, diverse female characters serves as a beacon of hope, setting an excellent example for young viewers and reinforcing the idea that everyone has the power to make a difference. It's a must-watch for anyone seeking an uplifting and enchanting cinematic experience that celebrates the strength and creativity of women in a captivating world of magic and adventure."
"I can't believe it. Humans have made a good movie. How is this metaphysically possible? Isn't badness defined as the quality uniting things that humans love?Let's start from the beginning to see where I got it wrong. In the beginning, the good God creates the universe. Ialdabaoth then creates humans in his image. Humans then excrete the civilization they love today. But somewhere in the middle of that rancid dumpster fire, there's a good movie created to sell dolls to little girls.This can mean only one thing. We were wrong when we thought intelligence is the solution to our problems. Maybe we should lobotomize the geniuses and start over."
"This film is filled with cheap cinematic and comedic tricks dying for attention and relevance. In the end, the moments are stale and require as sense of ""I guess I should laugh or chuckle a little, poor things.""The film preys solely upon the desperate desire permeating American culture for something, anything, please. (Nope still don't have anything original or high-quality in this Era of film-making).Most sequences of the film are a collection of ""unbelievable!"" instagram-like moments strung together with a lazy unity that affirms one thing: confusion.This film grossly underestimates the IQ of its audience or lacks the subtly and nuance to pursue the complex arguments regarding its central socio-political themes. It says only so much, afraid at every step to be cancelled but also trying to stand firm in some desperation for truth, to help stand up to that mean Mattel! The same Mattel that Warner Bros (who produced the Barbie film) is partnered with.Margot Robbie tries to give it her all (she can open one eye tear stream with the best of them) but her performance lacks the quiet composure of all struggling with identity issues. It is surely a barbie-rific film! Although even the fake smiles of the actors seem fake, almost as if they are saying, ""I can't believe I am doing this."" They almost solemnly predict the end of the film before a single ounce of real joy can be seen/had. The entire film is depressing, even where it is supposed to be joyful.There is no great sense of play. It appears everyone is outstandingly self-conscious and hyper aware. Weirdly hyper aware. These aren't artists (with perhaps the exception of Gosling). These are everyday men and women pretending to be actors and absurdly conscious of it. One can only get along with color palettes, explosions, and circus jokes / ""provocative"" one liners for so long. The real attempt at story was shaky at best. Amazingly studios allow Gerwig to direct a high school film project with a 150 million dollar budget and a volunteer casting call of beginning drama students and a few pretty people who always wanted to be in a movie.The long wait gets longer. When will art take a step forward? We have an American culture of business people (all greedy for more money, money, money)-very well, we lack artists!"
"Barbie is a very good start movie-try to popularize the feminism idea to normal people. Many people just lack a point or we can say a chance to touch such idea. After watching this movie, I realized that men all over the world love to be fathers and love to preach. Women, as the party being objectified, are always in the status of the object being stared at. When I saw ""Let me show you"" in the movie theater, all the girls laughed, and this kind of resonance for a long time was very exciting lol. The biggest surprise was the tribute to 2001 at the beginning of the film, which I loved. It is a good moral that civilization evolves when all women wake up."
"The movie did something that has never been done before. The details, the music, comedy, and my favourite.... the outifts!!! I could have never imagined that a movie with such entertaining characters and plot could be made based on a Barbie. I truly reccomend you warching this film, not only it is entertaining, but it reminds you how great it is to be independed and how to stay true to yourself. The movie also highlits the importance of talking about your emotions and how holding them im might lead to something worse.I have no doubt that this is the best Greta Gerwig's movie yet and I hope in the future she will spoil us with more fascinating stuff."
"Got free tickets for a preview and to be honest I was more than a little embarrassed to go. I did not tell a soul. As a cool middle aged gentleman if word got out this could have really affected my street cred.Anyway, I embraced the journey and I'm glad that I did. Here is my review written as a prententious critic that I aspire to be in my next life:In Greta Gerwig's latest directorial venture, ""Barbie,"" the esteemed filmmaker takes on the monumental task of unraveling the enigma that is Barbie, the iconic doll that has fascinated and polarized society for decades.With Margot Robbie as the eponymous character and Ryan Gosling as Ken, Gerwig's live-action rendition delves into the complex world of Barbie, attempting to extract deeper meaning from this cultural phenomenon.Gerwig masterfully navigates the treacherous waters of branded material, infusing the narrative with a blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. The result is a thought-provoking exploration of Barbie's role as a feminist symbol, challenging societal perceptions of femininity and girlhood.Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals?Gerwig compels the audience to contemplate this question, weaving it throughout the fabric of the film.In reality Margot Robbie dominated the film as expected and has developed into a true cinematic icon. The flm was fun and far above my expectations hence I'm giving it an 8 and boasting I watched Barbie."
"Margot Robbie is perfect as Barbie
John Cena and America Ferrera deliver hilarious performances
The movie tackles feminism and patriarchy in a funny and unsubtle way.Barbie movie is an inventive comedy that works both as a love letter and deconstruction of Barbie as a concept
The movie is fun, creative, and goes in unexpected directions
It has clever messages about manhood and redemption
Ken's character is redeemed and Barbie apologizes to him for ignoring him before
The movie portrays how isolating manhood can be and ends with the Ken's finding fulfillment in being their own people
The song 'I'm just Ken' is catchy and perfectly integrated into the final battle.Barbie is a movie that explores the struggles and joy of womanhood
Click to collapse
Seek out female perspectives on this movie to understand its message about womanhood
The movie is extremely funny, well-directed, and has wonderful sets and costumes."
"Hilarious, great comedic timing. Loved it. Welldone Margot and Ryan! Hilarious, tear jerking, heart warming. Ticked all the boxes.A great empowering film for our girls.I thought this film was for my daughters, but it was very much for me also.Loved the colourful setting. All the characters were just spot on.The film thoroughly captivated, enchanted, and spellbound me.The film rated a perfect 10 out of 10 rating! It had scope to be corny or a rght duff, but it completely surpassed my expectations.I totally plan to download this film when it comes out. One for all the girls out there."
"Alas, my high hopes were crushed. When i heard about this project, I saw the opportunity, and expected, rather hoped for, an utterly ridiculous over the top comedy where dollified actors could come up with some novel situations. I wanted to see what kind of comedic chops Gosling would trot out. Instead, after a razzmatazz showbiz intro, dancing dolls and high energy, the sad, busy, and quizzical plot unfolds as a very sorry melodrama. An emotionally vulnerable and beautiful but pitiful Barbie, and a truly oafish Ken, have passed through a ""Dimensional Membrane"" onto the earth plane, into a reality just as bizarre and unrealistic as the Barbie-Dimension, and the two doll-humanoids find themselves maladaptive and disliked, even persecuted. And they have come looking for a solution to an unpleasant sort of problem. This just isn't funny. It's pretty much a reworking of Judy Garland in OZ, way out of her element, trying to find the Ruby Slippers. In fact, it was a deformation of her feet as a Doll in Barbieland, that kicks off this whole sorry setup. Now I have to ask myself why I was expecting a comedy? Well, because the advertising suggested something ludicrous. When you see Will Ferrell doing pratfalls and the entire surreal pink Landscape of Barbie Land, Gosling with idiotic facial expressions and gestures, and Barbie presented as a very sexualized Super-Bimbo, sort of a witless Mae West, (who was very witty), I thought some very funny stuff was coming down the pike. Nope. I wouldn't say avoid it, but I would say it never really finds it's tone, and doesn't live up to its advertised premise. The crowd around me wanted to laugh, that was clear, and was struggling to find something funny in things that just weren't. This must have cost a fortune to produce. The money could have been better spent."
"This movie made me so proud to be a woman and really appreciate the human experience! It's amazing that a film centered around a toy managed to shed light on the genuine highs and lows of being human, making it a refreshing watch! It was funny, visually stunning, emotionally resonant and engaging. I'm not sure why some have labeled it as ""preachy"" or ""agenda-driven,"" because it merely highlighted the realities faced by women today. If these aspects were challenging to watch, that might have been the film's intent - to resonate with its target audience. I appreciate that the movie reminds us what Barbie's original purpose was, to empower girls around the world! So to everyone who feels that this movie was a personal attack, it might be best for you to stop over analyzing every little thing because you weren't the target audience anyway. Highly recommend!!"
"The Barbie movie is fun, ridiculous, and surprisingly dense. The production design for Barbieland is a spectacle that must be seen on the big screen to be appreciated. If you like or have nostalgia for ""movie magic,"" go see this film, because the people who made it really handled the production with care. Hollywood went hard here, and it pays off.Besides the spectacle, the script is pretty much nonstop jokes. I'm a middle-age guy, so my expectation going in was that I would have to cringe through some kids humor, but get to enjoy some more adult puns or double entendres a la ""I'll beach you off."" However, I was surprised by a very smart, fast paced, dense dialogue that matched my comedic sensibilities perfectly. I did notice, however, my fiancé and I were sometimes the only people in the theater laughing. So, your mileage may vary if this movie is not your type of funny.Yes, the movie has something to say about feminism, patriarchy, and motherhood, but I appreciate it for that. It seems so many movies recently with beloved characters, like super Mario Bros, are safe and boring, and the stories go nowhere. So, for the Barbie movie to dig into these social topics, I think will make it iconic. Is it too meta and fast paced for kids to understand? Probably, but I think they'll find that appreciation for it 10 years from now when they rewatch it in college.Finally, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are an absolute treat here. Both of them treat these silly roles as the most important work they've ever done. Their commitment here is insane. Any guy out there criticizing this movie because it's ""anti-men"" can learn a lot from Gosling about what it means to be secure with your masculinity."
"Never have i seen a film on the silver screen as loud and as proud of its feminist message as Barbie. Most movies half ass it, you can put the same recycled messages that are surface level in meaning and still pander to the male audience, cause no one's gotten the guts to actually give us a film with a story and characters that's truly for women. But that's just what Greta Gerwig does. This film wonderfully balances comedy and emotion, you'll be laughing as much as you'll be crying, especially if the message of this film speaks to you. A colorful set design devoted to capture the accuracy of playing with barbie dolls, a beautiful collaboration between several female artists, empowering the film's core of exploring one's identity as a woman in a male dominated society, and the talent of the film's lead actress, Margot Robbie along with the rest of the cast ties this film together into Movie of The Century.My one critique on the film is that i find by that end of the film it was a bit too apologetic to its male characters. While it didn't diminish the film's core, I felt Barbie's message could've been amplified far more if they were less forgiving as the film shines light on the double standard placed on women, barbie doll or human.Nonetheless, this movie is simply excellent. I found myself as a trans person who has went through his own existential crisis and struggle with identity coming out the theaters extremely happy with my barbie dolls from my childhood with me. Never would i thought i would find a film that spoke to me on such a personal level as many have."
"I never had high expectations for the film due to the number of just-okay films that have come out this past year, but Greta never disappoints- Lady Bird, Little Women, and now Barbie! The movie is surely a Gerwig classic. It is amazing how the outright un-serious, campy film is able to tackle such serious and complicated real-world issues. Naturally, there is a satirical exaggeration of society to convey the point of the story but was executed with a conceptually clever approach. The writing carried witty humor, strong character development, and heartfelt experiences- all shined ever so brightly with the array of superb performances. Margot Robbie's performance throughout the film revealed the depth of such a character that can often be seen as superficial. The same can be said for Ryan Gosling's Ken. (SPOILERS) It is clear that everything Ken has done to Barbieland (""bringing patriarchy"") was in a way to shape his own sense of identity and self worth, what he feels he often lacks in Barbieland. The film features a multitude of well-known actors that portray a great deal of what a Barbie can be. The set and costumes bring viewers the nostalgia of their childhoods and how this life in a Barbie dream house (and her clothes) were extremely coveted by young girls. On the other hand, it shows how Barbieland is not all it is thought out to be. I was pleasantly surprised at how the dance numbers were reminiscent of old Hollywood sound-stage musicals that we never really see anymore. This film review would not be complete without an honorable mention to America Ferrera's performance. Her monologue's feminist themes are reminiscent of Saorise Ronan's monologue from Little Women. It was delivered at just the right pacing and intensity, resonating with audiences. While the message is not at all new, many women especially feel heard. The film does a wonderful job of blending the inclusive comedy with previous or subsequent scenes that make viewers tear up- the simultaneous laughing and crying sort. Overall, ""Barbie"" is a fun, glittery, social commentary satire about female identity; the feminism of hyperfemininity, authenticity, and community; and what it means to be human in our messed-up, chaotic world. For the Gerwig fans, Barbie lovers, Barbie haters, and everyone else, go watch Barbie."
"I swear to god this movie is one of the best i've seen this year. My expectations were high BUT NOT THAT HIGH. I'm not sure if this movie is good for small kids, they may not understand the problems this film addresses. I'm really happy that this movie was created because we should talk more about this problem (I don't wanna say what is this problem coz it would be a spoiler and i want you guys to have a surprise). And seeing Ryan Gosling in this role is something i would never expect to see. We know Ryan from all those mysterious and dark action films so seeing him dancing in colorful clothes and doing all these crazy stuff is incredible. I love this man and I love him even more now, i'm so grateful that he took part in such a great project that addresses such a huge problems. If you're still wondering if you should go or not the answer is YOU DEFINITELY HAVE TO GO."
"I love greta's movies and I was enjoying Barbie until 3/4 of the movie. The last 1/4 was BAD. I'm giving it a 5, which I feel generous.The trama was ""funny"" but honestly not good enough.I do love all the actors and America Ferrera is awesome.I was looking forward to like it but the last part was so bad that I can't recommend anyone to watch it. And is not like the twist was bad, it was more like the trama wasn't good so there wasn't any ending that could improve it.Summarizing, if you are not a Barbie or pink movies fan, don't watch it. Not even if you are bored.If you like pink movies with no trama, watch it."
"The theatre was filled to the brim with 99% women and girls wearing pink, we felt united in the moment of watching such a beautiful film. It's a comedy but it also offers a glimpse into the real world and what it's like for girls and women daily. It was beautiful and i can only wish for more people to go and see it. The laughs and the jokes were only a small portion of the emotions we felt we could just let out, it was emotional in the best way possible and was a moment that i am thankful i could share with my bestfriend. Directors like Greta Gerwig are what we need in this world for it to be complete."
"A great film that shows both the hardship of real life and the beauty of life. Great film and unexpected .I would highly recommend for any viewer , I felt the corny dancing and the meaningful actions made for a great cocktail.I went with a mixed group of different ages and everyone enjoyed the film. Some found it meaningful and some found it comedic and slapstick.The cast was one hundred percent perfect and I can't imagine a different Ken or Barbie. Ryan gosling played his part superbly and you could at times relate to his character and other times laugh at his mid fortune and dance routines.Overall a great film."
"Barbie, with a surprising amount of political undertones, will probably be one of the most surprising releases of 2023.The movie showcases both sides of the coin, hyper-femininity and hyper-masculinity, with subtle jabs and character realisations throughout the entire film without becoming exhausting.It's undeniable that Barbie is a female empowerment movie but it's one that everyone can get behind.My only disappointments is that Micheal Cera got a marginal amount of screen time despite being the comedic punching bag, and it would of been nice to spend a little more time in Barbieland.Everyone will have their own take on this screenplay, and it might take a few viewings to understand the messages that the film is trying to provide to the viewer, but by no means is this movie bad."
"This was a great movie, far more moving than I expected it to be.Barbie starts with a bang, paying homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey. It also has a bit of a Truman Show feel but quickly goes in a different direction. Barbie has an existential crisis, incepted by a mother-daughter duo, and has to journey to the real world to restore the balance. Oh, and Ken (a marvelously complex character) tags along.Our Barbie is optimistic, smart, kind, and just a touch naïve. She asks big questions. She's comfortable saying ""I don't know."" And yet as stereotypical Barbie, she self-identifies as *not* the most talented of the whole crew. This makes for some lovely dialogue in the hands of Gloria's character about what it means for a woman to be ""good enough."" As Barbie discovers this, we too discover a curious inversion. Barbieland---materially vacuous (no tea in the teacups, no ocean in the waves) yet substantively rich---feels like home. The real, messed up world feels so aseptically alien.And the costumes and props are fantastically detailed. Great soundtrack."
"I think the significance of Barbie wasn't the fact that it was a fun, joyous, all around well movie. I felt everything. From the point being that women to this day hold such little power. You can't want to be skinny you need to want to be healthy. You need to show off but not too much. Nothing you'll ever do will be perfect to anyone in power. But along with this it brings up the fact that emotions are something everyone can experience and that it's okay, you can be emotional and logical at the same time. It's okay to not know if what you're doing is right. I won't ever know if I was made to do what I want to do. Am I supposed to be an astronaut? Is that what my purpose is? I feel lazy when I see that everyone is out having amazing times and I'm stuck in the same continuous loop. Literally, everything that can make me me isn't actually me at all and the thought scares me. In our world, we want and fight for power yet nothing ever comes of it. And this movie is the most beautiful way to showcase all of the world and what women truly do go through."
"The movie started on the light side and fun, but the longer it went on the more preachy it became. It seemed the movie could not make up its mind if it was going to be a light and a fun movie or a heavy teaching a life lesson movie. This gives the viewer a roller coaster type viewing, where you are laughing a little (not a lot), but then the movie goes into a long, life lesson on how men are bad, and not very smart, but somehow they run the real world. Women are the real smart ones and the real world needs to change to match Barbie world. This changes the whole movie from just a fun time to head beating lesson, which takes a lot of the fun out of it. Too bad."
"A breath of fresh air from almost all movies made in the past 10 years. Great acting, amazing set designs and a wonderfully interesting story with a few twists! I've been so turned off with many of the movies made in the past 10 years due to poor storylines, and an extreme over abundance of CGI, which I'm guessing most people like because that's the bulk of movies nowadays. This movie had me smiling or laughing most of the time, with a few heartfelt moments which brought a tear or two to my eyes. Congratulations to the writer, producer, Director and cast as it was an amazing movie all around - loved it."
"Didn't know what to expect... was pleasantly surprised. Clean humor that honored the struggles of women internally as well as those who feel displaced culturally in the US. Liked that it spoke the the variety of people and our roles in society. Was a reminder those thatsuffer struggle, sticking together, through intelligence, compassion and communication can make the world a better place and can be an amazing support structure. It encouraged acceptance of people with differences, people that don't look like you and challenged the battles over ""what's feminine"" or ""what's masculine"" (after all Barbie and Ken have no genitals)."
"Greta Gerwig brings the fun to the well known toy of generations, Barbie. Based on the trailers and interviews my hopes were high that it was going to be a fun and campy ride in the Barbie mobile. I would say it hit a few speed bumps. Women empowerment and understanding Barbie was spot on. Bringing in the discontinued dolls and ideas was brilliant. I feel the Kens' storyline was were the potholes were. Why can't it be Barbie's world and not so strong on a beating over the head that Ken is nothing. That Ken's only recourse is to take over? That Ken in the end, still isn't supporting Barbie as it should be. That might be controversial and some might say I missed the point, but I want my son to see it and come away with equality not that he should be diminished. If we want equality we need to model what a supportive boy/man should be. Partnership anybody?"
"Storyline: 8.5- Great story, could've been fleshed out more in some areas to have an even better overall connection; nonetheless, it still has a great plot, conflict, climax, etc. A little silly at times; but, it is a movie about Barbie. Pacing was good and easy to follow. It is, in my opinion, just about the perfect movie length at an hour and 54 minutes.Cinematography: 8.75- There are some really great cinematic shots throughout the film. Clear distinction between ""Barbie Land"" and ""The Real World"". Good angling on all characters.Acting & Costumes/Makeup- 9.75- The acting was wonderful. Every actor pulled their weight and shined. Many comedic moments that will have you laughing nearly to tears. Also, very serious moments that are executed well in such a way that may bring you to tears. The costumes & makeup were beautiful.Music Soundtrack: 9.5- Overall, extremely strong movie soundtrack. All of the songs align with the theme of what is happening during the current scenes & the storyline. The weakest song (and I mean from a vocal standpoint) is the one sung by Ryan Gosling.Choreography- 9- There is a fair amount of choreography in the film, and there is an all-ken dancing scene that is phenomenal.Overall: 9.1/10. This movie is PG-13 for a reason. There are lots of mature references. It is a movie made for adults, not kids. Definitely worth a watch, though, so go see it!"
"This movie definitely wasn't what I expected it to be. Although it was funny, it also had me question a lot of things in life. It hit the heart, it made me cry, and it really shows what the reality of the real world was and how we can all discover ourselves and not be making ourselves into someone we aren't. I walked into the theater thinking it would be all fun and like any other Barbie animation made in the past, but it definitely stood out and all the actors did great. Most women will definitely feel a sense of courage to do what they want in life and maybe also the men.This was a 10/10 movie. Definitely recommend to watch."
"Started well, had some great moments and acting was good.However, the point of turning Kenland back to Barbieland...what was supposed to convey? That Barbies aka women actually want to live looking like Barbies in their almost identical Barbiehouses? That it's women against men and men their dreams are stupid?I found the Mattel team going to Barbieland totally out of context and it didn't add anything either to idea or humor of the movie. Men leading the patriarchy in real world were made to look silly and idiotic, which didn't add anything to the ideas, but felt embarrassing rather than funny.I found the movie weird, confusing and not empowering at all."
"This movie was amazing both in the commentary it set out to say and the jokes. I'm not gonna beat around the Malbui dream house, the casting was on point and the references to some of the more obscure Barbie lore was appreciated. Ken also has some pretty fun scenes as well.Now listen I've already seen reviews about how some people aren't happy about the commentary in the movie. Well guess what maybe that's the issue then. We have movies about war but that doesn't mean we are saying war is good. Overall I think there are alot of people who wanted this to be a comedy so bad that they missed the very obvious signs in the trailer that it was going to be more then that. The comedy is there to soften the slap of reality that yes women are still objectified and they aren't going to sugar coat it.If this movie pisses you off because you think the plot is ""men bad, women good"" then you missed the point of Ken's story line and how he grew as a person. Grow up and learn to see beyond your 'Barbieland' where everything it's perfect for you cause it's not."
"This movie is the definition of camp and fun cinema that also makes you think. I don't think I've ever laughed as much and for so long as I did when I was in the theater watching this movie. This movie is one of them where before you've even finished watching it the first time around you know you are gonna be coming back to watch it again and again. I remember watching all of the trailers and teasers and being so excited for this movie but also scared, because this could have either be the greatest movie ever or the worst movie ever. And of course it was the greatest movie ever. I highly recommend to anyone who wants to just have fun and laugh for the 2-hour run time (that flew by super quick)."
"Barbie directed by Greta Gerwig is one of the most anticipated movies of 2023. From the first photos on set to the huge marketing, barbie promised a colourful set and dreamy background where the pastel aesthetic is a fundamental factor. It delivers amazing performances from the whole cast, Robbie and Gosling with unmatched chemistry, Ferrera's monologue and everybody else.The message is clear, how it is to be a woman in this reality, a mother, a daughter.. feminism seems superficial but it gives a powerful insight on the matter. Greta managed to tell us how impactful Barbie has been to little girls who dream of being whatever they want but she also criticises how damaging the doll can be to self-conscious girls.She exploits the famous figure to make fun of the patriarchy. At first it can be interpreted as a product of capitalism and stereotypes but you'll understand that the same Barbie is criticised in the movie for these same themes. This judgment is already solved in the message of the movie, Greta flips this concept using it to tell the story and its moral.It's camp, it's fun and it's pop.The script is smart and well written, it makes you laugh and sing and dance but all of it is balanced with profound conversation, Barbie and Ruth Handler, and with the amazingly and hurtfully sincere monologue by Gloria (Ferrera). There's a handful of cinema references, from Kubrick's 2001: space odyssey to The Wizard of Oz, there are jokes on movies that aren't to be taken to seriously, you'll find them funny.Jokes on fascism that are culturally genius and a rupture of the fourth wall that you'll absolutely agree with.It's not only a feminist message but Barbie expands its themes to Ken's character. The difficulty to found his own identity, to be someone outside of his shadow (his barbie).This film is demential and intelligent, an adaptation of the loveable doll, you can have fun with it but also write a whole essay about its moral and heart."
"I was positively surprise. I never write reviews, but I loved the movie. Was funny, the acting was amazing and it kept me so entertained ! Thank you Barbie! I really recommend everyone to watch it, I am happy I did.The movie was moving, funny, deep, refreshing. The acting of Ryan Gosling was impeccable. But the whole cast did such an amazing job too.The movie has comedy and touches of musical. Its a complete surprise. I would definitely watch it again.If you are undecided and you think this is a kid movie. It is not. And it is worth the tome. You will leave happy.Its Barbie and Its Ken !"
"The story in Barbie isn't about a doll. It's about reconciling the imperfect world we live in with the idealized stories we tell and create. We use our dolls, toys, and play to create those stories. We internalize the ideals shared through those stories. Sometimes they are good ideals that empower us. Sometimes they are toxic ideals that disempower us. Ultimately they are created by us and we are influenced by them.We created them, and we can change them. We can make them what ever we want them to be. We can make ourselves what ever we want to be. The tag line for the barbie doll is ""You can be anything."" That in the point of the movie. You can be anything."
"First, I can't believe I went to this movie. My 18 year old daughter wanted to go so I said ok. I watched the first 20 minutes in disbelief - with my internal voice asking, ""How did this movie ever get made?"" The story is stupid. The acting is bad. The movie tries to be a cross between The Wizard of Oz, La La Land, Being John Malkovich and The Truman Show but fails on all attempts. Is it a musical, comedy, drama, spoof? Yes to all. But again, it fails miserably on all attempts. Oh - and have I mentioned how we women are supposed to be superior to men? Like the Woo Girls in HIMYM, it's just sad. I'll never get my time or money back, so I recommend you just save your money and go see something else. I just can't believe this film has good reviews. It must me a new way to market films - pay a whole bunch of people to talk it up and write good reviews on social media, and then you'll get the crowds on opening weekend. You've been warned."
"Its fully a feel good movie with standard comedies, fantasy and adventure.People who are seeing movies for entertainment they will definitely enjoy the movie.Because this movie is full of entertainment.Don't expect anything other than entertainment comedy.People who are interested watching any other genres except this feels boring and waste of time.In the fashion part the movie crew made a excellent work .The outfits are too cool both men and women.The movie is enjoyable for all the age.And the famous toy Barbie is shown in very impressive way that never disappoints any single Barbie lover."
"Just amazing and a spectacular film for everyone of all ages. The cast and direction of the film were amazing! The set pieces and art direction was inspired. Additionally, the script was air tight and very funny. I cried and laughed throughout the film. I truly believe the movie will become a classic. The only reason it lost a star was because of some of the loose ends of the plot in the film. Overall the film was a great movie going event and extremely rewarding. I think Gerwig is very good at subverting audience expectations which makes the film more engaging. I would recommend this movie for everyone."
"I laughed and cried all the way through this movie as my 80's child heart healed and my midlife heart felt reassured that how I have felt through all these years is has been seen. Greta Gerwig is a genius and I'm sorry for all those who thought this was going to be some plastic-fantastic fun ride and were stuck with the deep existentialism and down with the patriarchy messaging - but this was a masterpiece! My only hope is this movie becomes part of the school curriculum and is studied for years to come. Bravo - you are changing the world Greta! And Margo, Ryan and the cast were absolute perfection!!! 10/10 all day every day!"
"When I'm going to see a movie I don't do research beforehand. I like to make up my own mind and hate spoilers. I didn't even have a look at the trailer in this case so I really didn't know what to expect from Barbie.But it's a gorgeous masterpiece, clever, surprisingly deep. People who say it's not just don't get it. For real.The full message is round up at the very end.I laughed, I cried, it truly hit me right in the feels.The set was out of this world. The costume designs were awesome.Performances by Margot, Ryan, America were fantastic. The rest was great too.Can't wait to see it again <3."
"Yes, this film receives my seal of being a yes film, passing all enjoyment factors. It has a) entertained me, b) made me laugh or cry and c) did not cause me to break the cycle of evolution and retract back into an amoeba. Factor c) may be triggered by rather an overload of cringe, a failure of the Bechdel test, a lack of overall slay, bad child acting or the most important, the inclusion of slander of any of the gorlz (Margot Robbie, Jennifer Lawrence, Taylor Swift, Florence Pugh, Kristen Stewart, Meryl Streep, Paul Mescal, Greta Gerwig, Stanley Tucci, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jamie Lee Curtis, *)*The list of gorlz is ever growing and may only be influenced by my opinion."
"With all the hype around this film, my expectations were high and were initially met. The film begins as a self-aware, lighthearted critique of its own legacy but, as Barbie steps her flattened foot into the real world, transcends into a clumsy story on gender inequalities. Whilst funny and original at first, it doesn't take long to notice the repetition of the same jokes that were introduced in the initial minutes of the script, as the film transitions into a full-blown battle of the sexes. Despite these flaws, the casting is well-executed, with Ryan Gosling delivering a brilliant performance as Ken. Unfortunately, even his portrayal is unable to compensate for the deficient plot."
"It was funny, gorgeously done and challenged people's view points which is a lot done for a movie made by a toy company. I found myself laughing and tearing up at certain points. I was in awe while watching it in the theaters for the attention to detail on props. It's insane how well made it is.SPOILERS ISH ?? My only critique is the ending for the kens. We sympathise with them throughout the movie and the message is about equal rights for women. But feminism is about equal rights for everyone! Ken's deserve their freedom too. However it definitely did the job of making men step out of their comfort zone and understanding what it's really like to be a woman."
"First of all, this film is not for everybody. Tho it should be, if we follow the principle this film is trying to teach us.I loved the funny segments in this. They are always introducing some new gimmicky ways to make me laugh. The comedic timing in this is very well done and hits my spots exactly. It is right between ""we make a whole big sketch setup for the next scene, just wait one scene!"" and ""this is my catchphrase, laugh at it!"". Somehow they managed to pack that into every little part and dialogue. So props to that.The overall message of this movie seems a bit preachy and too much. I can not describe how, it just did not catch me. It basically was the right tone and meaning for today, but the delivery is somehow a bit too 1990 for me. Basically I did not really felt the struggle of the main Barbie, but more of the support cast. They made the story feel more alive. Maybe that was the meaning of all of this. Eitherway it started a thought process in me, so I guess they hit the spot also in this regard.I was not pleased with the song intermissions, which gave this film a less meaningfull tone than it could have been. Performances were great along the board.So defintely a watchable experience with little laughs and moments to reflect. But not too much, so do not expect a lifechanging lecture on humans."
Amazing to watch and delved into womanhood using incredible references. Weird Barbie was such a humorous touch but every part of humour managed to add to the true meaning of the film. Even weird barbie highlighted how barbie was exploited by some users for their enjoyment using her ridiculing and yet she's seen as ugly despite the true fun and amusement she's brought to the world. Amazing soundtrack aswell though I felt some songs couldn't be heard very well at all. Amazing performance from Margot Robbie but as Helen Mirren said she was the wrong person to cast for sympathy during that scene where she calls herself ugly!
"I know that Barbie is for Toy Story 2 3 and 4 but this Barbie is something else like a doctor, a sports girl, a cow girl in the city. Barbie is being used as a toy. From the beginning of the movie the kids started to break tea cups, tables and baby dolls. Barbie went to ugly Barbie to go to the real world to find her kid. I surprised that Barbie had a memory of her kid who used to play with her that she doesn't n't like anymore. So Ken takes over Barbie island while Barbie lies down on the floor like a toy. Barbie and the other girls makes the boys go to war. The old lady and Barbie thought about a little girl who loved playing with Barbie so much."
"Hilarious, fun, poignant, smart, and satirical. As a middle-aged mother of 4, I related to Gloria SO MUCH. And I cried. Boy did I cry. Much like Everyone Everywhere All At Once, I felt SEEN. For all the critics of the movie, my response is, 1. (Quoting Jack Nicholson) YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH, and 2. ITS SATIRE, FOLKS! But like most satire, it flies over the heads of many. Many stereotypes are addressed in an obvious way, but others are subtle. Not going because you don't want to support what you've heard is a political ""side"", well, that's just ridiculous. Give yourself more credit than that."
"Firstly I'll say that I'm the movie's target audience: a female in her 20s. Even though the movie touched some subjects like the fact that a lot of girls grew up with Barbies and felt very insecure about their bodies (which I 100% agree with), and the right to choose what you want to be in your life, it felt uncomfortable; it felt as if all men in the movie were emasculated. In the world of barbie all Kens were uncomfortably stupid and only served for comedic purposes. I won't give spoilers but in this ""perfect"" barbie world you would expect that they would achieve true gender equality since not only Barbie but the Ken dolls are also doctors, scientists, politicians etc etc.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling went above and beyond; I enjoyed their performances. Some scenes were also very funny but personally I did not like the ending."
"I just saw the barbie movie this day and in a few words I can say that it exceeded my expectations that I had about this movie.First of all, the performance of all the characters in general is more than decent, and I also feel that it had a perfectly planned plot, since I consider that no scene is out of context or just filler, which is something that happens very often in movies these days.Also another aspect to highlight is that the film in general is still entertaining for audiences of all ages, since it contains humorous phrases and references that make the film more attractive to people.Finally, the main reason why I liked this film so much was that it leaves you with a very deep message, since this film touches on very sensitive issues that represent the defects of the human being, and this film leaves us a message that we are all equally important and that we must not let ourselves be carried away by society's stereotypes."
"When I first walked into the cinema to watch this movie my first expectation is just for it to be funny and fun pink bling bling stuff but I should've expected a more deeper meaning to this movie when it's a Greta Gerwig movie.And what even more interesting about this movie is when you watch this at the first half you would think it is solely about woman empowerment and stuff but at the end it really does explain about man's feeling and insecurities as well. The introduction of patriarchy towards Ken is such an amazing and fun scene to watch. Ryan gosling is such a good actor to play the himbo role since you can enjoy his character despite how he portrayed the toxic masculinity role so well.But I wanna focus more on my point of view as a woman myself here. Watching this movie as someone who's childhood revolves around Barbie doll brings so much nostalgia and make me realize how it plays a huge part in my journey as a woman. The transitions from being a little girl to a woman is spot on. It touches about insecurities and the man's expectations of a woman and many more crucial problems.It is so woman empowering and the message is quite obvious and delivered pretty strongly and straight forward in the scripts. But I couldn't deny the scriptwriting really touches my heart and makes me wanna cry. But i still wish it was being potrayed and conveyed more subtly as it will be more fun for viewers to interpret the message itself but I understand that this Barbie movie's targeted audience could be from all range of age so the message should be crystal clear.It's just some people might think that this movie is solely forcing an agenda. Like as a woman I get this whole messages but for someone else it might be coming off to strong and seems pretty stereotypical feminism BS which is a hard pill to swallow but we all know certain people in our society will have that kind of opinion when they saw the movie. That's why I wish it comes more naturally, thats all. But I think the ending make up the whole strong message about feminism earlier with how its was not just about that.Like I said the movie also touches about the whole experience as a human no matter what their gender are and how we're flawed but that's just what life is."
"Everything was just so perfect. The cast, margot robbie is basically my fav person and ryan is also nice.. ig. I love how they added some actors from sex education like emma, connor and ncuti. The design was unbelievably perfect as well, the soundtrack, THE MESSAGE, EVERYTHING. I JUST LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH IT WAS SO FUN TO WATCH. It felt relatable, felt so many kinds of emotions at once which was an amazing and unique experience. LOVED IT GRETA AND MARGOT DID SO WELL!! I also loved how there were so many kinds of barbie's, like transgender barbie, allan which i think is non-binary and more."
"Go and see it with neutrality. It is not a movie exclusively for the female audience. I have fully appreciated the way in which certain topics are addressed, such as Capitalism and Patriarchy, the stereotypes of being an attractive Woman and the problem about the toxic masculinity. At the moment it is the film that most surprised me, positively, of 2023. There's a special chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie, since, when they appear together in the first scene till the last one, and when you note this detail you cannot think : ""Damn, they're so gorgeous!"".Would recommend it!!!!!!"
"Went into this movie knowing it'd be hilariously awkward. Robbie as Barbie and Gosling as Ken. Also a great supporting cast including Ferrell, Cena, Cera, Ferrera, Liu, McKinnon, just to name a few. It was thoroughly entertaining but a few segments were a bit too preachy on feminism, but that's to be expected when it's a Barbie movie. This film had great costume and set designs and will win Oscars for those two categories for sure. It will most likely be nominated in all the major categories. My only hope is that this destroys Mission Impossible at the box office so we can witness Barbie defeating Tom Cruise. Worth a watch and probably a re-watch once it goes up for rent digitally."
"The only good things about this movie were the actors. Felt like I was watching one big commercial for Barbie constantly plugging outfits and what Barbie really means for young girls, I guess it was produced by Mattel which says a lot.I was hoping for something smart and satirical like the Lego Movie but this was just a silly story with dumb humour.The nostalgia is the draw card for people (including me) I loved Barbie growing up but it wasn't enough for me to enjoy this.Dont waste your time, the producers spent more on the advertising and promo work than they did getting a good story together."
"I'll start with the issues, because overall this movie was enjoyable if you don't take it too seriously.The majority of the movie is a lighthearted comedy. The biggest tool a comedy has to use for conveying societal criticisms is satire. The beauty of satire is that you can make some really good points. When the movie used satire to make it's points it was great. But the 5% of the time that it forgot about the comedy altogether and tried to take itself too seriously (I'm not saying the subject itself matter wasn't serious) conflicted with it's own tone. You can make all the points you want to make with a biting satire without stomping on your own tone.The ending for Barbie was felt misguided. Without spoiling it, there's a point between when the final conflict is resolved and the very last scene of the movie where barbie experiences something. It looks like the scene is supposed to be deep and insightful, but it honestly felt like the writers got to that point in the movie and didn't know how to end it, so they just kinda piled on some abstract feelings and vague phrases for a transition. Sort of like a high schooler writing an essay and not knowing how to write a concluding paragraph.The middle school girl character is a 1 dimensional character, but writing young children characters seems to be a challenge for Hollywood so you can't blame them too much. And lastly the whole car chase scene was a blatant Chevy ad to the point that it was almost funny itself.Now the good:
The visuals and characters were all done really well, and not just Robbie and Reynolds but the rest of the cast. The movie itself was really entertaining and worth a watch."
"A few of my friends saw the movie and really liked it so I gave it a try tonight and was pleasantly surprised. This movie is one of a kind. I've had mixed feelings about Margot Robbie but she delivered a wonderful performance. She was perfect as a life-sized version of the iconic doll. Helen Mirren's narration was well-paced, not overly-intrusive, and she dryly delivered a line that resulted in the audience erupting into laughter as I am sure we were all thinking the same thing as Margot was delivering a touching monolog about 3/4 through the film. The entire cast clicked: Ryan Gosling can play just about any role and his portrayal of Ken is another notch on his belt of challenging, versatile, and memorable performances. Kate McKinnon nailed her part and if there is such a thing as perfect casting, she was perfectly cast. I wanted to present an Academy Award to. America Ferrera when she finished her heartfelt reflection of what it is like to be a woman these days. Finally, the music was brilliantly matched to the mood of the film. I didn't expect the music to be so wonderful and it went a long way to infusing an emotional essence into what otherwise may have come across as a technicolor cartoonish fantasy. I want to see this movie at least one more time in a theater. There was so much going on, I know I missed some things."
"Don't let people scare you away from watching this movie, especially if you're a woman. It's definitely more deep than I thought it would be, there were some issues I didn't 100% relate to, and some parts I felt were a tad exaggerated- however I loved it! To those people who say it hates on men, etc: you obviously didn't pay attention. In fact, you should have realized that the way they treat men in the movie is there to show how a lot of women were and still are treated in some ways today. Overall, just watch it with an open mind and take in all of the good messages it has- especially at the end."
"Acting is good, Margot did an amazing job at portraying Barbie even though Ryan as Ken absolutely stole the show to be honest. Humour wasn't amazing but it was still good enough to make me laugh a few times. Plot is slightly messy, not horrible, like I get it but the movie didn't really dive into anything too deep either in my opinion but at least it does mention some important subjects. Another thing that bothered me was the waste of Will Ferrell's character who could have been a better ""villain"" that simply an incapable clown. I still very much enjoyed this movie and think the movie still works because it's execution, cool idea and good acting but needed a bit more complexity and maybe a better written villain with actual motives in order to become a ""masterpiece""."
"As a man who has never touched a barbie in my life, I was definitely not the intended audience for this film. However, I absolutely enjoyed it. It's funny, entertaining, and poignant. I came in thinking it would be sort of silly and fun, which it was, but it also was about barbie, an always-positive ""person's"" journey into the real world and how messed up and unfair it is. She believes that the real world must be just like hers, where women are recognized for their achievements and always given the opportunity, respect, and tools to succeed in life. She is obviously very disappointed in our world when she actually experiences it. I think any guy tagging along to see this will enjoy it unless he's a misogynist and/or very insecure in his masculinity."
"I am just amazed how many good actors and actresses agreed to bein such a movie!!!! It's neither for kids nor for adults...its a movie withno identity..rubbish at its best.Whatever msg it is meant to send , is lost in the bad flick.....i wouldn'teven dare call it a movie.....wasted time .The names of the cast and the name of the flick promised so muchand delivered nil.Too bad that the most famous doll of all time be in such a flop.Watching the preview was the reason i went to see it . All the brilliant
colors reminded me of movies of the golden era of the 50s...Extremely Disappointed."
"The movie is amazing, Margot Robbie gives an amazing performance and the ending is unique and has somewhat of a Truman show vibe for me , Ryan Gosling is amazing as Ken and overall the cast is phenomenal in their roles. However, I feel like the plot is at some places a little bit weak and it feels as though this film sets out on a crusade to educate you on the injustices in the real world and does mainly focus on feminism and issues surrounding that topic but it does also cover topics that aren't specific to feminism. Overall, I do not mind the role of feminism in this story and the mother daughter relationship as well as the whole female focused parts of this movie because it is simply amazing and at the end of the day we have to consider this is a movie about Barbie so all those topics are perfectly acceptable in this movie. For example, if this was a movie about some traditionally boyhood toy you would expect it to embrace that in its narrative. In conclusion, I feel as though this deserves a much higher rating then 7.8 for me personally at least a 8.5 or higher therefore I have decided to put 10/10 so the average is higher and the movie is rated properly."
"I saw this movie opening night and my expectations were beyond met and exceeded the limitations of what I thought a good movie was. It was one of the best movies I've ever seen. I was moved completely and entirely. I laughed, I cried, and I left the movie changed. It is a masterpiece. For those who don't understand, I highly recommend watching the movie again. The writing, the characters, the set, and the outfits were so brilliantly curated. I do not even hesitate to say it is now one of my favorite movies and one of the best movies I have EVER seen. Greta Gerwig is nothing less than a genius and deserves ALL of the recognition. The casting was perfection. The meaning behind the movie holds a special place in my heart and EVERY SINGLE PERSON NEEDS to see this movie. My favorite part of the movie was not ONLY the movie itself but the effect it is having on the communities surrounding it. The collective unspoken rule of dressing up to go see this movie. Brilliant.The conversations surrounding this movie is essential to have.I recommend to every single person. Greta Gerwig is brilliant."
"After watching the trailers, promotional materials and interviews I had very high hopes for this film, especially when looking at Greta's other work. I was not disappointed.I went to see it at the cinema with my partner the first weekend of its release, and before I had even sat in my seat I was already impressed. Over half the audience were families with young children, dressed up and holding their own barbie dolls. The rest were couples, older people, groups of young lads, and friends. The majority of the audience were sporting pink, and there was a real buzz of excited chatter in the air that I can not recall ever experiencing to this extent before a film. I think this is a testament to the entire creative team, to manage to produce so much excitement among so many different types of people is a feat I have not personally witnessed accomplished in my entire adult life.The opening scenes were outstanding. The introduction to barbie struck me on an emotional level, and perfectly set up the characters of the film. The introduction to Barbie left me reminiscing of my own childhood experiences of playing with the dolls, and managed to perfectly capture the excitement that was to come.I really enjoyed how some things were left unsaid, and your imagination had to do the groundwork. In a film made to appeal to both children and adults, often most aspects are over explained and nothing is left up to interpretation, yet Barbie managed to ask questions it did not provide complete answers for, whilst still maintaining accessibility for its entire audience.It had some really imaginative sequences and routines that ensured the film had constant sparkle. The choreography and set design complimented these aspects beautifully.There were really touching moments on humanity, feminism, society and relationships, without villainizing Ken (Men), which would have been an easy cop out.It was also oozing with comedic value, Robbie and Reynolds were hilarious, and brought a youthful exuberance to their respective roles. None of the jokes fell flat, and there were many moments where I was laughing out loud in the cinema.I will say that the casting of the mother and daughter did not feel as strong, and that there were some scenes of product placement that felt really forced and did briefly take me out the film.Additionally, I felt the film did not really know how to finish its story, and the last 30 minuets were weak compared to the rest of the movie.Despite these criticisms, I absolutely adored the film. A more honest reflection would probably lead me to score it 8/10, however, personally, the relationship I had with Barbies in my own childhood strengthened my appreciation for the film.It was funny, touching, exciting all whilst being really quite sad. I laughed and I cried.I would recommend this film to anyone, as I feel that all people going to see it with an open mind will find that they authentically enjoy it.Thank you Greta, for taking me back to my own childhood, and capturing those big questions that begin in our youth on the big screen."
"While not seeing previous Greta Gerwig's movies might have been a mistake on my side, starting exploring her filmography with Barbie (2023) was surely quite an interesting choice. Honestly, I was a little scared and worried about finally seeing this film - after so much hype on Twitter and other social media it would be disappointing finding out that the movie is not a 10/10 masterpiece. Eventually, I decided that no matter how bad (or good) Barbie actually is, at least I will have the pleasure of seeing Ryan Gosling's astonishing face (and body) on the big screen. The first few scenes of the film absolutely captivated me with their doll-like, plastic pink aesthetic, showing Barbieland as a perfect, colorful paradise. I have to admit though, once our two main characters travelled to the real world, things got a little cheesy. Of course I didn't expect Barbie to be deep or dramatic, but for me it fell into the family toys-come-to-life movie cliche a little bit too much. However, I really liked the comedious aspect of the film, all the references to history of the Barbie doll and others. I might as well say that Barbie became my new comfort movie, something to watch with your best buds, or even a loved one."
"So good, the emotions, the reality and how it came together as a live action BARBIE film was perfect and outstanding which is good for adults as well as children. I am so impressed how well this was pulled off and the details from the outfits to the design of the sets was outstanding. There was laughing and crying in this film and which relates to everyday life and having all the different barbies was brilliant! My favourite has to be the weird BARBIE because I definitely relate to her more! I recommend watching this and giving it a go because you may think oh it's just a kids film but once you've watched it, it's not what you expect and I'm itchy to watch it again!"
"Definitely not understanding why this movie was over hyped. What age demographic is this movie for exactly? It's not a movie for little kids. Maybe pre teen girls? And I can't understand how they wouldn't be bored with this film. It's music every couple of mins and everything is way over the top. Actors were great but the script isn't entertaining at all. Honestly the trailer was more fun than the movie. My kids were bored and wanted to leave before the end. But after we made it through the first half of the movie, we might as well suck it up until the end. All in all, an amazing cast and set, but it falls short in actually entertaining the audience."
"Was absolutely amazing. Barbie came to life, it felt exactly like when I was a kid. It brings a deeper more meaningful message without being too harsh. I love how it brings the 2 worlds and perspectives together, it really got me thinking. When barbie goes to the real word, I truely felt like I could relate, as if it was speaking to me and probably most women out there. It's definitely a movie for those who love as well as hate barbie. Its a 10 out of 10 for me. Everyone must see this to gain perspective, a doll's world so completely mirroring our own. Also, the toys of this movie is amazing, a must see."
Im a barbie girl in a barbie world. Life is plastic and its fantastic. Really good. Meta. And a fun time with the family. There's a lot more i want to say. Ryan gosling was funny and good and its nice to see asian representation . It's not as funny as i thought it was going to be but it had a lot of meaning. Women empowerement. Greta Gerwig is always a good one and maerogt robbie definitely is perfet for the role of barbie. I cant think of anyone else. I was a little cringing at some people going and wearing pink but overall everyone had a good time and i think familys would enjoy it and its better than oppenheimer.
"I Love this one so much!! Movie of the year!!! Most men here will criticize and give it a bad grade, but you have no idea how much a film like this can touch the heart of every mother, daughter and girl who loves Barbie dolls in the whole world, it is moving to watch all of this, besides that final scene only serves to show the struggle that women have always suffered their whole lives and that their daughters and those who will come in the future will suffer. A film that sends such an important message is extremely important to us. I laughed and cried so much, was such a lovely experience, i wish i could watch again but this time with my mom."
"I must admit, growing up I've had complicated feelings toward Barbie. In the beginning she was fun (my favorite was one of the mermaid Barbies), but growing up I distanced myself from the pink toy. It was no surprise I wasn't excited about the movie until I heard Greta was involved.This movie is exactly what I would want from a Barbie movie. It's extremely campy throughout, but also recognizes that life is very much complicated. It's not easy being an adult woman or man. Do you want to laugh? Watch this movie. Do want to feel seen and have one of those cathartic cries? Then go and watch this movie!"
"This is the first movie I've ever watched that I cannot stop thinking about. The way that it perfectly describes how it is to grow up as a woman and lose your girlhood, while the weight of society comes down at you all at once is insane. Margot Robbie was quite literally the most perfect choice for this movie and I have never had such a sinking feeling in my chest while also loving a movie so so so much. The one problem is that it is so catered to women that the men watching literally just don't understand. The point of the movie, at least what I think is the point, is to show how women are still being put underneath men, but these men watching wont get the same reaction women do. They wont understand how true this movie is and how in a world full of Ken's, they should be an Allan."
"The Barbie Movie stars Ryan Gosling (Ken), Issa Rae (President Barbie), Margot Robbie (Barbie), Will Ferrell. (Matel CEO), Simu Liu (Ken), and Kingsley Ben-Adir (Ken).Directed by Greta Gerwig and written by; Noah Baumbach and Gerwig-the crisis in Barbie (2023) is that Barbie suffers a crisis that leads her to question her world and her existence.There are several highlights to the Barbie Movie. Ben-Adir (Ken) changed his voice to that of Ben-Adir in Secret Invasion as his Marvel Cinematic Universe Character named Gravik. Only several men in the cinema understood the MCU reference. Speaking of men-Barbie references male dominance in the real world as something that is concealed by men obtaining Phd degrees and certifications. Moreover, men are portrayed as fools in this movie. Gloria played by America Ferrera has a husband who struggles with the Spanish language and the Ken's think more with the head on their groin areas rather than their heads with a brain in it.All in all Barbie is a good movie for women empowerment, I give it a 5/10. Nonetheless, if a Barbie movie universe was created then I would most likely support it for the funny male depictions."
"With some of the greatest casting seen in a film (looking at you, Alan), this film was bound to be an enjoyable watch. Maggot Robbie plays her role with a sense of misplaced optimism, anxiety and true ennui. She questions her place in a world she no longer understands and brings us with her to find out. Ryan Gosling goes on his own journey of self discovery, understanding and empathy. Incredible costumes, sets, choreography and songs are a joy to behold on the screen. Great Gerwig expertly navigates complex topics with warmth and compassion, making us all wonder if the power of Barbie can truly help to heal the real world."
"This movie was wonderful. I went in with lowered expectations because I find the majority of big movies don't live up their hype. This was not the case here. Beautiful acting and message without being too pushy. It was very accessible; it didn't pander, and it didn't condescend. The dialogue felt very real and not scripted. SO much fun and tons of funny moments. The only thing I questioned was why the montage at the end didn't include some of the pain and sad moments of human existence. It sort of made Ruth saying ""I can't in good conscience..."" a strange thing to include. I'm hoping this will maybe make it into an expanded version?"
"At the beginning, it cleverly reflects social issues through gender reversal, but not merely as a reversal. Both gender groups retain their essence, and the ending isn't about one group's victory over the other, but about working together. It encompasses not only gender equality but also recognition and acceptance of others and oneself. It's not about feminism, patriarchy, or gender confrontation. It's not about stereotypes or perfectionism. It's about gender equality, embracing individuality, and mutual understanding. This movie isn't exclusively for women; it showcases the fierce presentation of chuunibyou (middle school syndrome) in both genders. Outstanding performances and dance sequences keep the entire film engaging without clichés."
I never have done a movie review because I have never seen one worth reviewing till Now!!!!!!!This movie went above my expectations. So rare to happen in the movie industry! Both main characters rocked the screen this is a must see for the whole family!!!!Go see it you won't regret it I promise!!!I loved so much from beginning to end! Like the trailer said it's for you if you love Barbie and it's for you if you hate Barbie. So many laugh out loud moments!So aesthetically pleasing!Beautiful sets!Beautiful story!I will definitely be buying it when it is available to own!! Its so good in so many different ways!!
"My girlfriend and I went to see this movie last night on the day of release because she was so excited for it. Going into it, I had my doubts... I was pleasantly surprised.The attention to detail was truly amazing, the colourful Barbie World, the way the dolls moved and interacted with objects, the references to less popular and discontinued Barbie dolls.I thought that the comedy in the movie was going to be completely cringe worthy. However, the movie was actually funny. There was not any point that I felt that they were trying too hard to make the movie funny or anything like that. There was just the right amount of humour for a movie like this.The adult humour was a bit of fun too, fair to say that I did get a good amount of laughs whilst watching.Allan (one of the discontinued Barbie Doll models) was my favourite character throughout the movie. Though his role was fairly small and he was there for a bit of comic relief, he was funny and also somewhat relatable.I appreciate that this movie is not for everyone, that being said, I do think that there will be many mixed reviews about this movie.I for one have nothing bad to say about the movie, my girl and I thoroughly enjoyed it, so much so that she walked out of that movie much happier than when we walked in."
"I genuinely had planned to give the movie a 5 because it wasn't bad but it wasn't good but then the longer I have had to think after the movie I still feel that way but also like the movie was a waste of time and money. I really had hoped it was going to be amazing!! It is Barbie for crying out loud. And while I have never been a huge fan of playing with them, they are iconic. I also felt they cast Ken and Barbie perfectly. However the movie made little sense, their are no really good amazing lines to quote, and the ending was blah. It wasn't very fun or funny either. So I decided it gets a 2 instead of a five."
"A breath of fresh air, what an inspirational film on so many levels. Gretta showing the world of screenwriting just how it's done. I can't wait to see what new wave this brings to our cinemas. And what stories it inspires in younger generations of female creatives. If you don't agree, you're missing the point. Watch it again and listen to the subtext. And look around you, how many people came wearing pink? Don't underestimate the pink pound!Coincidence that this came out with Oppenheimer? A juxtaposed way of telling a story, this film shows everything that's wrong with rom coms and drama and all genres. If you're a writer, producer, director, sit up and take note."
"I feel like I have never watched anything like this before. Its so original, witty, entertaining, satiric, while also dealing with some important and serious issues culturally. I would recommend everyone to watch it, and Im so happy that this exist for future generations to come, to grow up with. It hits so many issues spot on, and with so much humor at the same time. I've never seen these feminist issues being taking up, in such a good way and in such a popular big art piece.Ryan is amazing in this, and definitely steals the scenes!The only thing i missed, and why its not a 10 for me (but 9+) is because I would have loved to have seen more real-life struggles, when they are in the real world - or that it just be more real, tough, like what the real world can be, so we understand more why it can be hard to be a women in todays world, like they mention later in the film.But overall, loved it and love that this exists now. Thank you Greta and Margot, and the whole team!"
"This movie was so absurd and so fun! I laughed so hard my face hurt. I see people feeling like this movie concluded that women are better than men, but the lesson was to celebrate womanhood in all its forms, with the overarching message for everyone being to find who you are on your own. Barbie told ken he should stand in his own light and find out who he is outside of his relationship with her! He's kEnough!!! I think because this was such a big budget and highly publicized movie, people don't super know who greta gerwig is and how her past movies have really celebrated womanhood through all its phases, especially the messy parts. It was so fantastic and so nuanced and self aware, i'm grateful this movie exists! P.s. If ur mad that the barbies didn't give the kens true parity and just threw some lower level judge position at them, then wait until you find about what the supreme court in the real world does!!!!"
"Barbie lives in a perfect world.When she discovers the real world, she realises that people age, have depression, family issues, and do not see the world as a perfect place that they want to be in everyday.This theme of Barbie coming to terms with what it means to be a human, with both the lows and the highs, is what leads to some truly beautiful scenes that make the room freeze. I saw the movie in a packed venue, a couple hundred people all munching crisps and children rustling and asking questions.During these scenes, everything was silent. No one moved, ate, or talked.As for the rest of the movie, it was great. If you're just looking for a good movie, this is one. Plenty of humour and the soundtrack is amazing, an instant save on Spotify. The dance sequences, especially the ones with Ken, are a feast for the eyes. The movie touches on the idea that you dont have to be perfect or the best. You dont have to be a lawyer/doctor, or a celebrity, or a nobel prize winner. There is nothing worng with just being average.The only thing stopping me from rating higher is a personal itch with the movie - the main part of the movie is Barbie dealing with a male dominated society (patriarchy) and all the issues women face in that. I don't mind the concept, but after the movie I wished that wasn't the main focus. It would have been a masterpiece 10/10 of a movie if it had focused on the problems of the human soul (sadness, loss, regret) and the joys of human life (raising a child, friends, finding happiness in the worst places) instead of ""boys vs girls"".Lastly, I would recommend a word of caution for any parents taking children to see it - it is rated a 12+ (at least in the UK) and thats solely due to the sexual undertones and jokes thrown around. Nothing terrible, but could be slightly uncomfortable.The hype surrounding the movie paid off, I'm glad I watched it."
"As a huge Barbie fan I was first sceptic, but as the movie trailers came out I got more and more enthousiastic. The movie was a big 10 for me. The jokes, the costumes, the actors, the atmosfere, it is all there!!!! Even the music is so nice with all the extras!This movie definitely deserves Oscar's,If you are a big Barbie fan you will understand the jokes even better! Especially if you are older than 30. It's fantastic! It is not really a movie for childrens, they will love the dancing and clothes and so but will not understand everything I think.So if you want to have a good laugh! Go see this movie!"
"I had no idea what to expect but did not expect what I saw .I go to a few movies a week and always try to enjoy them based on their merits . I mean , not everything can The Godfather.I expected a movie that was just dumb fun, but it was not that .I thought the movie started ok and got interesting when Barbi went into the real world . I think the tried and true fish out of water concept would have been really worth exploring more in this movie .I thought casting was fine , Margot Robbie owns the screen and Gosling was ok . But you are only as good as the script you are given .The cinematography was fine. Barbiland was bright and colourful as you'd expect. No complaints there .I felt the agenda and messaging was way too heavy handed. A missed opportunity for nuance and balance . What the writers were trying to say was just super clunky and the victim of this was good story telling .I can't imagine children caring about what they were trying to say . What was advertised as a light hearted and breezy movie is really an attempt to be a social commentary. I think it's false marketing .Movie 4/10
Marketing 10/10."
"I finally had the chance to watch the wonderful Barbie movie, and I must say, it did not disappoint me at all. In fact, it surpassed my expectations! Barbie turned out to be much more than what I initially imagined-it's truly remarkable!One thing I really liked was how Greta addressed all the criticisms about Barbie while infusing a feminist twist into the doll (Barbie was the first doll which had power of chosing). Gerwig's take on childhood and the patriarchy and feminism and love and death resonated throughout the film, adding an extra layer of depth and thought-provoking themes. I found myself both shedding a few tears and laughing heartily. The movie was incredibly humorous and touched upon meaningful aspects of life.I took my 11-year-old niece to see it, and she loved it too (although I'm sure some of the social points might have gone over her head).The sets, hair, and costumes were absolutely outstanding. The cast delivered stunning performances: America Ferrera gave a deeply moving speech, and Ryan Gosling's performance stole the show, proving many, myself included, wrong about his suitability for the role.Lastly, I must mention Margot Robbie, who was simply stunning and the perfect fit for Barbie. She was naive, sweet, and camp, all wrapped up in a ""stereotypical Barbie"". Although Anne Hathaway and Amy Schumer were previously associated with the project, I am delighted that Margot Robbie made it happen.""This Barbie is far from plastic. It's fantastic""."
"I have seen a better movie than I expected. The cast was really good and also the dialogue helps a lot. There was not anything ridiculous, as I expected, and the actors did the best work in order to create a mix between comedy and drama. The story is ready to shock you and the lines are both funny and touching. The movie made me think about How Grinch stole the Christmas and The Truman Show.Again, Ryan Gosling show us that he is a master of musical and this time he is something like the bad guy.Margit Robbie was exceptional from beginning to the end.All the other actors did a great job.I really recommend this movie!"
"I really liked this film it is a pretty sensitive topic in a land of fun and rainbows I think it got the message through but had just the right amount of humor it also had a lot of great acting g from Ryan gosling and Margot Robbie I really like this film it's great for Adults and for kids even if the topic flies over their heads although I don't think the acting and the screenplay is all flawless I think there are some things they could've done to make it better for example in one scene when Barbie was in her car driving to the ""real world"" it was really glitch in choppy at least for my theater but I don't think that was intentional.-Great film overall 8.5/10."
"Pushing all of the serious reviews aside for a moment, this is a classic comedy of the thirties, updated for our times. Screwball comedies like ""Bombshell"" with Harlow and ""My Man Godfrey"" were wonderful satires. They centered around a battle of the sexes, with a female character dominant over the male lead. They were loaded with farcical situations and spoofing, as well as lots of physical comedy.And like ""Christmas in Connecticut"", they often had a gentle but serious 'message' at the end, and America loved it. The woman is always smarter, generally with a plan up her sleeve, the male lead (most of the men in the movie) are oblivious. The more self-important, the more obliviousness they are to what's really going on around them. I'd now love to see Ryan Gosling in a re-make of ""It Happened One Night"", he'd be terrific. Or Margot Robbie in a re-make of ""Some Like It Hot""."
"Barbie is fun, hilarious, emotional, musical, thought provoking, full of fantasy, sometimes over the top. It transfers us to whole new magical world and you will enjoy every single second of it while makes us relate to ourselves and our real world problems, emotions and situations. Filled with powerful performances and soundtracks. A instant classy, Must Watch. Margot Robbie owns the role Barbie. She lives the character. Ryan as Ken is so great. He does really steals the show sometimes. All the others supporting characters and human characters are so good and fun too.Barbie movie really respects it's roots and pays a beautiful tribute to all Barbie dolls and it's creators."
"Anyone who gives this movie above a 1 star has a vested financial interest in its success. This was basically just a mess of a movie. All over the place plot with nonsense scenes and situations. There were some funny scenes but at its core, it just had no depth, logic or meaning other than Barbie v. Ken. Let's present a fake world where either men rule and women are puppets or women rule and men are puppets. This reads like someone's thesis on the state of feminism in modern society. I feel bad for the families that took their children to see this expecting something lighthearted and fun. This was not it. Just silly..."
"I went in to this movie expecting a huge joke of a movie and came out with a smile on my face and a warm heart. So many things resonated with me, from the weird Barbie that I inherited from my older sister, to never really understanding where Ken lived or why he never went to work. Margot Robbie was the perfect Barbie. America Ferrera did a brilliant job of being a normal woman trying to explain how to be the 'perfect' woman to Barbie. Ryan Gosling STOLE THE MOVIE! His Ken was so insanely good and the 'I am just Ken' song and dance routine was insanely good! Thank you Greta Gerwig for writing this movie!"
"It definitely lived up to my expectations. Walking into the theater I was scared. Considering all the amazing marketing and promotion for this movie, it could've been easily disappointing, but it wasn't for me. The acting was amazing, the jokes and dialogue were funny, but most importantly, it had a message and they stick to it throughout the movie. I don't think the world is ready for a film centered around women, maybe it's too soon. I think some men will wrongly assume that it is an ""anti-men"" movie and they will hate it for it. It's far from that. My hope is that, with time, people will understand its message and realize that we're all Kenough."
"I thought the movie was fantastic, fun and a good time with a good message. The acting was great, the music, the colors, the cinematography, story. All ""A"" grade. Only 2 things really coulda been better and even with that I still highly recommend the movie!2 things that could be better include first putting less silliness and more useful messaging around the corporate heads. Though this could also have saved the movie from getting too deep for some, it could have been excited fun but more impactful.Second, if the ending wasn't just her going in the real world. I wish Barbie had a stronger ending as a character, a much more eloquent speech on what's wrong and even highlight the issues we had in the real world trying to fix patriarchy. Think it would be stronger if Barbie stayed in Barbie world and fixed it and then if they wanted to set up for a possible second film she is visited in consult."
"Barbie is a movie about Barbie having an existential crisis! Yeah, that's actually the movie. And it's GREATAll the Barbies in barbieland, believe that they helped woman and young girls be whatever they want to be and empowered them, but Margot Robbie's Barbie finds out that's not true, she completely looses it.Margot Robbie is fantastic and both sides of the spectrum, the stereotypical Barbie and portraying the existential crisis she is one. But at this point what can't Margot Robbie do, she's fantasticRyan Gosling is the real MVP, he puts in a performance of a life time. The ""Ken off""... ""Ken War""?... ""War of Ken's""? Whatever! That whole sequence is amazing, from the song, to the choreography. Ryan Goslings comedic timing is impeccable, and I love the journey he embarks in, and his ending, to finding out he doesn't live for Barbie, he is his own ""Ken""The production design is absolutely fantastic, every single detail is looked after, the costumes are beautiful everything in Barbieland is so colourful and so pretty to look at.There comes a disconnect when they reach the real world, that is a necessary evil. I say that because I didn't like many of the sequences there, but I thought every was necessary for the rest of the movie to work.Not every joke lands, but that's what happens when you take risks, the movie is hilarious nonetheless.It's a fantastic time and my only regret is that I didn't find a pink shirt to wear to the movie."
"This movie is set for what women experience it's a movie for the men who say ""What if the roles were reversed"" You can call this a feminist or political movie but if equality is that to you that says enough. This movie should be a reflection of men and women it's not a kid's movie they will not understand it but more for those who grew up watching it and playing with dolls as she was the first girl toy that went outside the mother role she is a role model to many young girls who are now women and a lesson to men who will never understand you can call me a feminist by truly women has it hard ""men hate women, women hate women"""
"The production and the costume design is absolutely wonderful, same goes to the most of the cast. With beautiful attention to detial, uncluding actual cars and houses that we played with.But the message of ""patriarchy is bad"" seemed to be shoved down your throat too aggressively, with the whole thing seeming a bit misguided and hateful toward men, and i dont believe in battling hate with hate. Dont understand me wrong i am a woman in engineering (world dominated by men), but the concept of feminism is not men vs women and what most feminists strive for is not matriarchal, which the barbie word is. Pinning us against each other is not helpful, as we should work together to reach equality, one cannot work without the other. What could be a wonderful message turned confusing and too strong in my taste."
Such a an amazing film! There was laughter and tears in the movie watching this made me realise how incredible us woman really are! It's so educational and it's definitely something that my little girls will be watching!I loved all the details of clothes to the houses and colours was so nostalgic.Margot played such an amazing barbie a Ryan played such a brilliant Ken I couldn't imagine better actors for such a role.I loved the tongue and cheek humour and sometimes how they would speak with random one word answers or it would come across silly as although they are real life they are supposed to be acting as if they are being played by kids so somethings was just so funny!10/10 film my all time favourite!
"The duality of being perfect and yet still not being enough is portrayed so well here. This movie is about being able to relate to the constant evolution of the human condition, specifically in a way that centers growing up from being a naive child to being aware of yourself and the judgement of others. This movie does center women, but any individual claiming this movie is a misandrist anthem has no idea of even a notion to what the point of this movie was.Hilarious, intelligent, beautiful, poignant, tasteful. This movie makes me warm to the knowledge of being a woman. I will be watching more Greta movies from now on if not all of them. I cried."
"I did not know what to expect from the Barbie movie when I went with my two adult daughters. I was very pleasantly surprised! The movie made me laugh and it sometimes brought a tear to my eye (but I mostly laughed through it). The sets are spectacular. I would not be surprised if the movie wins an Academy Award for at least the set design. Ryan Gosling is very funny as the underrated Ken and Margot Robbie is very well suited to play the iconic doll. A very good commentary on how, sometimes, the Real World works. The story was, at times, very touching, but it's mostly a really good time. I loved it!!"
"Barbie was by far one of the best movies i've watched in 2023. From the acting to the costumes, it was all just so amazing. I have no words to express how i feel after watching Barbie. It had to much emotion built into it. Margot Robbie had such a speechless performance. Greta Grewig is the writer and director that can make a movie that has so much emotional value and meaning. It gives you a look into being a woman and the struggles but also about finding who you are as a person. I enjoyed this movie like no other it was hilarious and an emotional rollercoaster. I hope we can see a sequel to Barbie. The movie deserves all the love. Go watch it now!!!"
"Barbie was an incredible movie and experience. There was a perfect balance between the replication of our own childhood experiences with the dolls, and the introduction of the hopeful changes for the current state of the world. The way the movie made our little imaginations come to life on the big screen was magical. It was great to see a movie about barbie, the stereotypical perfect doll , being so inclusive and aware of issues we still have today. It was emotional, funny, and a breath of fresh air. Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, and the rest of the cast... just bravo. It was truly so wonderful & I can't wait to watch it again."
"Okay, so I'm a 30 year old woman, feminist and cinephile. I left the theater feeling both confused and a bit disappointed. I really wanted to like this film. It's about damn time we have more female directors topping the box office. And I gotta say, the costume and set design of this film was incredible. But the entire plot of the story was all over the place, leaving me feeling little to no empathy for the characters, albeit Ken. Now Ryan Gosling MADE this movie. Though at times, I wasn't sure if he was supposed to be the antagonist or puppy dog we were supposed to sympathize with. What really got to me about this movie were the stereotypes, which just contradicted the entire message. Scenes that were meant to be moving fell flat. Characters had very little development. There was no real conflict or climax. The end was funny but switched the mood entirely too soon. And hey, I actually love The Godfather. I still love it more than Barbie. And I'm a chick...so there ya go."
"I am neither a Barbie lover nor hater but I am a fan of great sets and creative films so I was prepared to put up with a bad story line to see the visuals but I LOVED it! So, so funny, Ryan Gosling was amazing as was everyone really. Haven't laughed so consistently in a film for ages. The end was slightly weaker so I've knocked off a point but regardless it's one of the best films I've seen in ages. The sets were amazing as I had hoped. I could have lived without the Will Ferrel character as it felt a little bit spoofy whenever he was on screen, a bit overacted but that's just a minor criticism in a brilliant movie. Well done team!"
"I went and saw this with one of my best friends and it was a quite ride. We laughed, we cried, we had a great time! Barbie was definitely one of the best films we've seen all year! This was relatable on so many levels! I personally felt that there really is something in this movie for everybody! It pokes fun at the way society is but does it in a way that makes you really think about how you are living in this world. It has also made me decide to add more color into my everyday life as well! The entire cast was absolutely incredible in making this film both be true to what Barbie is to little girls and what it did for children growing up!"
"Haters can hate all they want. It's a brilliant movie. I could not have asked for anything more. In 2023, We live in a complex society with extreme sexism which has been brilliantly addressed by none other than Barbie! The last Product that one would expect to address this issue. Was it perfect, no- nothing is perfect today. It didn't cover many topics. But did it do an excellent job at covering the topic they decided to address - absolutely YES! They can take my money - again and again for creating content that is relevant and important and changes all our perspectives. The cast was brilliant. I can't believe how many people they roped in. And Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were AMAZING as Barbie and Ken."
"I think everybody should watch this movie. This movie will change someones perspective of the world. If someone hates on this movie is because they did not understand the message and meaning behind it. Margot Robbie did an excellent job portraying Barbie. Would totally rewatch this movie. This movie made me laugh, cry, and made me think about my childhood. Its such a beautiful movie. Greta Gerwig is one of the best directors of this generation. Truly the best movie released this year. She even broke box office record for female directors. LOVE BARBIE AND EVERYONE SHOULD WATCH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"This movie is not only an actually funny comedy with an amazing script and good jokes, but a seriously intense story of womanhood, girlhood and motherhood that portrayed how much the patriarchy affects everyone. As a girl, this movie resonated with me and every single line about being a girl in this world hit me hard, but it was so beautiful. I've seen men say that this movie was 'feminist garbage' or 'over-exaggerated' but it honest to god wasn't. Not only this, but while being a movie that accurately represents the feeling of not knowing who you are or what you are going to be (aka girlhood) it was pro-men and not in a bad way. Somehow, a movie so strongly empowering women also gave men feeling and hurt. This made the movie so honest and just good. I could go on for hours about how much this movie means to me, and that it's something with messages that will stick with me forever.With all this being said, it was funny as hell and my whole theater was dying at some of the jokes made 😭 they did not hold back."
"Barbie is a hot pink mess, that ironically sees world in two dimensional black and white. Aside from Margot and Ryan, all the characters are literal one dimensional bimbo.Yes, i'm aware of the over the top humour, and almost cartoonish art direction is intentional. Yes, there's supposedly more 'substance' , than the style's portrayed. But the message is so generic, and only on surface level that nothing that hasn't been done before.TO BE FAIR, some part of it is actually enjoyable, and i had a few laugh. Margot and Ryan are great, but the rest of the casts is awkard. And the ending is kinda nice. Overall it's ended up being a 'meh' for me.5/10
Puking rainbow."
"It was a literal cinematic master piece. It was comedic, touching, educational, ground breaking.It touches upon feminism, misogyny, patriarchy, women's relationship with themselves.It showed a utopia run by women, Barbie land wasn't perfect, the kens were ignored but not hated, undervalued but not sexualized.In a world meant to mirror patriarchy, we saw a difference in treatment that really opened people's eyes.It also highlighted how the patriarchy is toxic to all involved including men, it touched on the lack of emotional intelligence men have, it highlighted toxic masculinity and overall critique of how men and women have been interacting with each other since the beginning of time.The hardest thing about watching this movie is knowing that there will be a group of people who interpret this as ""hate"" when it couldn't be further from the truth and the audience who rejects the messages this film shows are the group of people who need this education the most.The best part of this movie was seeing women of all ages come to the movie theater to laugh, cry and wake up mentally, together.Overall this movie shows the struggle of women and girlhood in a patriarchal society and how it not only demeans women but strips men of their validity, forcing men to grow up disconnected from their emotions and experiences of others and how important it is to bridge the gap between genders to create a BETTER world not just for women but for men as well.This film is truly for everyone and powerful enough to change the trajectory of society. Fantastic film."
A story that explores Mattel that manufactured the barbie dolls Margot and Ryan Gosling steal the show and are phenomenal in this as well as the supporting cast having a satisfying amount of screen time which gives everyone a moment to shine the soundtrack is great and really adds to the world of barbie highlights was Will Ferrel he also shined in this and made some great moments as well as Alan played by Michael Cera who I haven't seen in anything for ages and it was good to see them again greta gerwig did an amazing job with this movie and hit out the summer blockbuster of the year with this I give this a solid 8.5/10.
"It's a good movie. Walking out of it I knew people wouldn't like it considering we rarely have a women's actual point of view in cinema. It's actually quite funny seeing people's reactions to it as if everything that we were showed in the 2 hours of the movie isn't true.In my viewing people were clapping, laughing and crying. It's touching and I'm sure many will relate wether people want to admit to it or not. (This movie isn't about a perfect doll)That being said if you don't like musicals you might not love this movie there are quite a few numbers in this film. Not bad ones just some are abit longer than I'd like.Overall I'd watch again and I've never actually owned a Barbie 👍🏼"
"Barbie movie had superb casting, writing, acting, and plot twists. It was a surprisingly cerebral movie with a poignant message on the perils of patriarchy in the real world and the exclusion of men in the Barbie land. At its heart, Barbie is a movie about self-discovery. The movie is much more insightful than I expected and takes a deep dive into the perils of minimizing the humanity of women and men be it in Barbie Land or the real world.Barbie Movie has some plot twists and it challenges stereotypes and preconceived notions of the roles of men and women in society. Barbie doesn't want to be put in a box in the real world and Ken wants to have value and a meaningfully existence in Barbie Land."
"We can be surprised at the bold feminist narrative of this film, which turned out to be a larger portion of the movie that most anticipated, but we should all learn from it. How urgent is an appreciation for women and their leadership if it takes a movie about literal toys in a fantasyland to see a female president? Barbie shows us what society would look like if women occupied ALL of the roles currently held by men, which quickly illustrates the alarming lack of representation. Barbie points out the irony in laughing an all-female Supreme Court, when the United States Supreme Court (for example) was all-male for its first 191 years. Barbie's achievements extend to business leadership, Nobel Prizes, and space travel.The film breaks down feminism for all ages and gender identities, taking female empowerment to levels so basic that young children will immediately recognizes real inequalities in our world. Gerwig and the wonderful cast explore feminism through mother-daughter relationships, the workplace, and even generational differences through a touching portrayal of Barbie's founder, Ruth Handler.A host of LGBTQ+ characters add to the strong community atmosphere of this film, in addition to physically disabled characters and other marginalized Barbies who effectively teach inclusion as a benchmark and not an ideal. The film wastes no time pandering to those who take issue with the narrative and by doing so, encourages women to unapologetically take up space.Mattel's willingness to confront the unrealistic body expectations and problematic pieces of Barbie's history head-on seriously validates the message of this film and the importance of doing better because you know better. Cheers for Barbie!"
I almost walked out but I was with my friends. I even wore a pink dress. I really wanted to like this movie but it was way too ridiculous for my liking. I should have known that it would be more for barbie fans but I was never really into Barbie.Ryan Gosling will look back someday and wonder why he did this nonsensical movie.Margot Robbie was excellent as Barbie and if you're a fan of Barbie then you'll like the movie.I came home and had to have a glass of wine.I'm looking forward to seeing the new Tom Cruise movie...way more my style. So it really depends on your taste in entertainment. Maybe I should have had a couple of glasses of wine before going...LOL.
"I love Greta Gerwig so I knew I'd love this. It, however, exceeded my expectations and was a movie so great it broke through my expectations and my version of the real world. I will see this again as many times and with as many people or by myself that I can. This is one of the greatest films not only of the year, but of the decade, if not the century. If I sound like I'm over exaggerating it, for me, I am completely serious. Please go watch it with your mom, your dad, your lover, your sister, your brother, your best friend, or your worst enemy. It's worth it, it really really is. Bravo!!!!!!!"
"This movie is charming and many people I know who also watched this absolutely loved it and recommended it to me. The movie was absolutely hilarious and we all had a laugh. Kids, parents, men and women (everyone) laughed and actually had fun. At the end of the movie I was left with wanting more. This movie is at least in the top 5 as it was something I really didnt expect to enjoy so much. I thought at first that it would mediocre but I was so wrong. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie did a fantastic job I would absolutely rewatch this as the movie was just better than expected. I highly recommend this movie. This Barbie movie got everybody wearing pink and it just did everything right. Hats off to all casts & crew."
"I wanted a girly movie with humor, amazing looks, and a feminist plot. A true show for the ladies. And this gave me that and more. So many profound moments, so many funny lines, such good acting, the cinematography was beautiful, the sets were perfect, the outfits were on point. First girls movie I love with no overt emphasis on a romantic relationship. Just a beautiful, complex, funny story about barbie. Everyone was perfectly casted. I was nervous about all the young children in the audience but there was no sexual scenes, little cursing, and most innuendo seemed to go over their heads. Loved the light this movie shed."
"As a teenager I kinda just went to this movie because of all the hype and jokes on Instagram, TikTok etc. But surprisingly this movie was actually really good. Unsurprisingly Margot Robbie was phenomenal, and was the PERFECT choice for Barbie.When the movie first started I really didn't know what it was going to be, I thought it would just be a girly movie about dolls and feminists, and everything wrong with Hollywood nowadays, but this quickly proved otherwise. It had the perfect amount of jokes, (which were surprisingly funny) the plot was simple but entertaining . Toward the end of the movie it got really serious, and it really had me thinking about life in a way where I just want to get my life together and be a better person. In conclusion this movie was great and Greta Gerwig did an amazing job with the cast and the movie as a whole!!!"
About reality. None of the nonsense of ask the Barbie Movies. In all honesty it was about patriarchy and feelings being human. It was also about the relationship between children as they grow up and their toys. It would not be something i would expect to bring someone under the age of 13 to and expect them to be entertained. Very much more silly adult stuff than kids in the sense of being to understand.I told my human it was pretty much Rocky Horror Picture Show without the sexuality and way more pink. Not really a movie to take serious but lighthearted and just a goofy movie to enjoy on some down time. If it wasn't so new then i would do an Episode on my podcast about it.
"Firstly, let's start with what was good about Barbie and move forward from there. The colourful palette, the set designs and costumes were perfect to bring you into a world that doesn't take itself too seriously. Barbie wasn't meant to get all philosophical and it wasn't necessarily supposed to provide us with a point. What it gave little girls is happiness and entertainment value. In the early stages of the movie it undoubtedly had potential to be a lot of fun with a comedic effect.This silly satire soon finds itself covering too much ground about how the world of Barbie is female dominant, alongside how the real world is male dominant. It evolves into a feminist movement film that is a little dated, then slowly back peddles and suggests everyone should be who they want to be. That all you have to do is find out who you are and what your purpose is. It almost becomes lost within its own thought pattern without really conveying anything meaningful. It feels like a load of thoughts with no conclusion or that somebody has thrown a pad of post-it notes in the air. The musical tone and lighthearted comedy that seemed set to propel this movie into box office glory, felt neglected to some extent, when real world themes were contemplated. What was working at first will slowly devour with over dramatic speeches of everything that is wrong with a male dominated world. As well as other complaints about having so much on your plate and being too god damn tired.Barbie finds herself wanting to leave Barbieland to feel real emotions rather than go through day to day life like everything is perfect. The cross-over between worlds worked to some degree, to me it was showing the girl leaving behind her dolls and becoming a woman to join the sometimes scary, but real world. (Margot Robbie) portrays Barbie very simplistic, her approach works as that seems to be what Greta Gerwig aimed to show. Greta Gerwig differentiates the worlds developing both Barbie and Ken as they learn from their experience interacting with the real world. There appeared to be references to the Matrix to me as Barbie is given a choice between staying in Barbie world or going to the real world to discover what's causing her malfunctions. Also the owner Ruth Marianna Handler gives off an Oracle vibe in the scene where she offers Barbie tea. One little girl blames Barbie claiming she set women back decades making them stereotypical girly girls without a purpose except looking pretty putting clothes on and off and doing house chores.(Ryan Gosling) gives Ken a lot of charisma and is purposely obnoxious at times creating an antagonist for Barbie. The Ken's are portrayed as weak little love puppies in Barbie world without a purpose juxtaposed with how women are received in the real world. Gosling reminds me of a wrestling villain that the crowd are wanting to hate on, he is a little over the top as he is turned against his fellow Ken's by Barbie manipulation. The poor performance of Gosling attempting to cry towards the climax added to the later half of the movie losing it way. It all becomes a little too silly leaving the audience flabbergasted at what absurdity they just witnessed."
"This Barbie script, IMHO, is packed on so many levels of thought - on were we are today and how we got there. To those who trash it, I say, ""Lighten up Francis.""Everyone plays their part uniquely and with verve. And the set alone should be considered for an Oscar. We needed this movie for the sake of sanity... too much politicking has clouded the atmosphere.To all those who grew up with Barbie, Ken, and G. I. Joe, I hope you remember that it was a time for childlike innocence to play and have fun.There is truth in comedy... just ask Aristophanes.Reflect on it.Note: The reference to Kubrick's 2001 (1968) is absolutely hysterical."
"""Barbie,"" the film, is an enchanting cinematic experience that is sure to entertain viewers of all ages. It's a vibrant and delightful exploration into the world of one of the most enduring and iconic dolls ever created. Its storyline is compelling and keeps you engaged throughout, making it a truly wonderful movie.What makes the movie stand out is its successful use of humor and adventure that ensures it isn't just another kids movie, but a family affair where adults can also derive enjoyment. Furthermore, the movie is brimming with fun characters that each add a unique flair to the narrative.A major highlight of the film is the character of Ken. He isn't merely a supporting role, but emerges as a real scene-stealer. Ken's charisma and witty dialogue delivery is splendid, adding a new layer to his character that audiences are sure to appreciate. His performance has a certain charm that makes you look forward to his scenes. Indeed, he truly stole the show.Despite the largely engaging narrative, the movie does come with a few plot holes. At times, the story lacks logic, and there are certain developments that seem a bit rushed or inadequately explained. However, considering that the movie is based on the universe of Barbie, where the rules of reality are often bent, these plot holes can be somewhat expected and forgivable.In conclusion, ""Barbie"" is an entertaining and heartwarming film that successfully captures the essence of its source material. Its flaws are minor and largely overshadowed by its vibrant characters, engaging narrative, and a particularly standout performance by Ken. Even with some plot holes, it's a cinematic treat that offers plenty of enjoyment for both kids and adults."
"I Will keep this as spoiler free as possible. When I heard Greta Gerwig was directing the Barbie movie. I was instantly excited to the fear of everyone around me. I would tell them ""Greta Gerwig wouldn't do a superficial Barbie movie it would be more, it would have message."" To my surprise it was all of that and more! It was funny and clever. It showed the problems with Barbie (the toy) but also the dreams for Barbie for young girls. It was campy in the best way. And America Ferrera's monologue deserved a standing ovation and I even teared up a few times. So please ignore the low dumb reviews and go see the movie and make up your own opinions. At least for me it was delight to be seen and I hope you feel the same."
"Barbie was so fun! I think some scenes were a bit hard to follow but I think that's a fun play on how girls play with dolls. I laughed a lot and felt a bit moved and touched. I wasn't really sure what to expect but it was fun to watch all the way through! I loved all of the vintage Barbie pieces and references to the many versions of the doll as well. The scenery was amazing, I think Barbie land gave off a technicolor vibe which was amazing. The scene I loved the most was when Barbie comments on how beautiful the old lady was and the older woman says she knows it! It's a fun film for women of all ages, my grandmother, mother, sisters and friends could all relate to this film! A true masterpiece on girlhood and womanhood."
"For a girl who grew up playing with Barbies wasn't at all what I thought it would be. I didn't think there would be a huge plot, and I was so wrong! The movie should be what every woman needs to see. Everyone in it was amazing and perfect (not Barbie perfect 😉). Had an amazing plot that made me really consider how far women have not come in life. I do love the line when a man has to ask for a job in the government and gets told he can have a much lesser job. I can not give it enough accolades. Everyone cast was perfect for their role. America Ferrera and Margot Robbie were perfection for each role!!!!Will watch again and again!"
"An film that tries to balance out humor and leaving social criticism in the minds of the viewers. Barbie falls flat with its criticism not only because it feels flat and out of place, but most importantly unnatural and unimportant.Why does a film about a female toy that kids play with need to comment on feminism. The use of feminism is to give a woman the right to choose for themselves and to be what they want, for example no woman nowadays should be a housewife if they do not want it to be. There are still current problems such as loans, the pay gap shouldn't be a thing, that is where gender equality is important, but Barbie gets it wrong and simply criticizes the mental state of being a woman and having it hard in its own life and still try to cover it up and being controlled by men. While I know that this is a problem in some cultures and countries, it is not the ones that people watch this film in. And Barbie definitely doesn't means it in that way.Ken plays the stereotypical men, he wants to rule and fulfill himself in his life, and he searches for meaning. His character development ends with him needing to let go of Barbie to truly find himself, and Barbie says that he wasn't created only to be Barbie's boyfriend, but truly, he was. No one bought a ken toy without a Barbie toy, so why can't we let the toys that girls play with, be toys they play with?Barbie sees the Real world as an issue because she thinks it only gets controlled by men, but she doesn't see that barbie land is a place which has a woman dictatorship.I was prepared for an fun time with laughs, but was rather left devastated by this film, because it tries to criticize how we treat feminism and gender equality, but then it gets it wrong, and finds problems where they is none. It rather comes across as the message, woman are good, men are bad. This is not the type of film that would inspire a little girl to be something special, this is the type of film she doesn't even understand or care for."
"I tried getting tickets for this movie for 3 days, and it was all sold out. But we didn't give up. The sun rose, and determination made me do the longest line at 2pm for a showtime at 9pm. Watching a movie in a third world country while on vacation is hard.Back to the main point, I cried. Don't watch this movie with your mom, because you will sob and try your hardest not to make a sound in a silent room.This movie captures girlhood in such a unique way, not a lot of people will get it. Barbie was my childhood-so when I sat down in the movie theater, it wasn't eighteen year old me that watched it, but little 4-13 year old me. It was such a beautiful experience; dressing up and being a girl. It made me really happy and I fully enjoyed it."
"I found this movie one of the more entertaining movies I have seen in some time. I didn't know what to expect and started out thinking when we were in Barbie Land how are they going to make this interesting for the next hour and 1/2. I found out and was pleasantly surprised by the twists and turns I didn't expect. When Barbie ends up in the 'real world' it goes from entertaining to interesting and unexpected. Margo is perfect as Barbie, Ryan as Ken is over the top and to be enjoyed. What I haven't read and am a little disappointed by is the failure to recognize how good America Ferrerra and Ariana Greenblatt were. Totally enjoyed their screen time as well. Don't event get me started on Kate McKinnon as 'weird' Barbie. I was one of those children that actually melted Barbie's hair in my bedroom closet and equally defaced and marked her with indelible markers. Didn't mean I didn't love her, was just precocious."
"I expected this to be a very good movie with some feminist undertones. It ended up being insanely funny, ridiculous, fun, and stupidly entertaining, yet highly topical and commentative. This movie hit on so many topics, patriarchy, capitalism, feminism, even misandry, yet managed to stay consistently funny and wild throughout. It never goes where you expect it to go but always defies expectations. The only reason I don't give this a 10 is for the small section of time where the feminism appears a bit too heavy-handed, and I can see where that would cause some male viewers to lose interest in the message. Other than that, this is the best movie I've seen in years and I can't see any topping it any time soon."
"I really enjoyed this movie and its message. I wish the underlying meaning to the story was a little more subtle, but it was good nonetheless.The soundtrack/songs were one of my favorite things about the film, and they fit really well into scenes. As someone who doesn't enjoy musical numbers in a movie that much, I like these a lot, because they were actually good songs.One of the final scenes of the movie, where Barbie and Ruth were standing together talking about being human was so pretty and well done. It actually got me a little emotional, which I didn't expect.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling really did their jobs well, along with others like Micheal Cera. Overall, the movie was pretty great, and the acting was fantastic."
"I haven't written a review on IMDb before but I felt like I need to for this film.Genuinely one of the most heartwarming yet emotionally poignant movies I've seen for a very long time, and honestly the first movie I've genuinely felt understood by.It made me laugh it made me cry, I never expected the Barbie movie of all things to stick like it did and strike a chord with me. This is a movie that links directly into my experiences as a woman and perfectly encapsulates what it feels like to be under the societal pressures of being a woman and the impossibilities we face every day. America Ferrera's monologue was incredible.Honestly, I'd recommend this film to anyone and feel like it's crucial that it gets the recognition it deserves. Greta Gerwig is a phenomenal director and I can't wait for her next project."
"I found this to be a mixed bag.First up, when I walked into the cinema I expected there to be lots of young Barbie fans - there weren't more than a handful. The audience was a real cross section. Probably the majority were females - just. People of all ages from a few young girls through to pensioners - with lots in the teeneager to late 20's group. Lots of people wearing pink.This is the first time I can remember since Terminator 2 where I couldn't go to the screening time I wanted as it was sold out for my two first choices (in the day time).I was expecting a high camp movie that works on both levels - young kids and something for the adults. Thats not really what we got. This is not a kids movie. The group of kids sat near us were visibly bored after the first half an hour. Its a 12A for a reason. There seems to be a perception that this movie is for little girls waving Barbies around - it isn't.The first half hour has all the camp stuff, setting the scene, adults acting as dolls, funny Barbie world-isms, etc.Then it changes when America Ferrera and her joy-sucking teenage daughter are introduced. It stops being so much fun. The central message of the film is then clumsily hammered home with no subtlety for the rest of the movie - taking the viewer out of Barbie world. Its message is also delivered inconsistently.The final joke of the movie does not hit home very well and seemed a bit unnecessary.With the above criticisms, heres the mixed bag bit - it was very funny in places. We laughed out loud lots, but seemed to be the only people in the 3/4 full theatre laughing. Its also very clever in places - like the discontinued Barbies.Ryan Gosling is excellent. Will Ferrell is hilarious. Michael Cera is good. Others are confusing (Rhea Perlman's character...). I expected more from Ncuti Gatwa - given he is the new Dr Who.Some very amusing musical numbers.It felt a little long. Would have made a nice 90 minute movie."
"I entered the cinema with high expectations, and they were massively outdone. The movie unfolds in a humorous manner, as lovable characters evolve in the most beautiful way they could. Margot Robbie is truly outstanding, and as a spectator I fully lived the experience thanks to her incontestable talent. As the experiences slowly unwrap, the issues and feelings that are contoured cut deeper and deeper, and the audience gets to experience these emotions in a sincere, beautiful way.The movie is about the simplicity and complexity of life, about humans and their emotions, about what we do and why we do it, and about how they all meet in a fulfilling and imperfectly beautiful point."
"I was amongst the people who thought they saw a majority of this film based on all of the filming stills posted on the bird app in 2022. I still wanted to see it. Something about their perfect neon rollerblading outfits. I saw one preview and wasn't sure what the plot was going to be, I didn't care, I still wanted to see it. I wasn't expecting it to be amazing, but amazing it was. Well done!! Margot really knocked it out of the dollhouse. Ryan I'll never look at the same way way again. This 1980s Barbie Superman is very pleased. It won't be long until the opening dance scene is all over the clock app. I haven't felt so compelled to learn choreography since Michael Jackson's Thriller. Also, girls rule. Sorry, Ken."
"Barbie (2023):Barbie (2023) is a clever political comedy, instilled with scenes of artfully-employed and often-touching drama, and rife with thinly, albeit comedically veiled commentaries on the woes and whims of patriarchal society, neo-feminism, republicanism, and, surprisingly given the film's main overarching themes, democrat beliefs. At a runtime of 1h 54m, the film was fantastic; I thoroughly enjoyed my viewing, particularly due to the performances of one of the strongest casts I've seen in any film released this year, with Robbie (as Barbie), Gosling (as 'beach' Ken), Ferrel (my favourite performance of the movie, as the Mattel CEO), Mckinnon (as 'weird' Barbie), and Cera (as Alan), amongst others, serving the film's witty, multi-faceted writing well. Each person felt perfect for their role, and I don't personally think it could have been cast any better. It was perfect.SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT.The story is simple, but well executed and easily palatable for a range of ages, largely in thanks to the near-scintillating writing of Gerwig and Baumbach, and the clever concealment of political messages, such that they either: fit in well with the story and serve pivotally to the plot (Ken introducing the patriarchy to the other Kens in Barbie Land, or, as it becomes, Kendom), or, are placed into a scene in which they cause no hindrance or clunkiness and simply convey a message (Ferrel's character, much like his President Business in the Lego Movie, wears an outfit analogous to that of Donald Trump, and Ken's whole newly-instated patriarchy is certainly designed to mimic many republican beliefs, along with perpetuating stereotypes like gorging on beers by day and engaging in superficial traditionalisms (horses!)). The comedy is, by all accounts, really funny. Multiple gags persist throughout, like the discontinuation of 'Pregnant Barbie', the lack of genitalia on Barbies and Kens, Weird Barbie (Mckinnon), and the callowness of the Mattel executives. There are great one-off jokes too, and many are clearly intended to cater towards adults, as well as children, like when Barbie sees a billboard for the 'Miss Universe' beauty pageant on the Venice Boardwalk, coming to the conclusion that they must be the Supreme Court (most political entities are conventionally attractive females in Barbie Land), 'depressed Barbie', along with other Barbies playing off body-image stereotypes, and a surprising innuendo spoken by Ferrel's character, in which, with no real context, he refers to the Mattel HQ as a 'long, phallic building'. Overall, the film is very funny, and knows when to, and when not to employ comedy in a scene for the best effect.The pacing is tight for the first half, and it manages to maintain good overall pace throughout, slowing slightly towards the end but still moving along nicely up until the credits roll.Now, the characters. I can't lie, there is not a lot to say, and that's not a bad thing. Each performance is marvellous, thanks largely in part to great casting, but for me, the characters didn't evolve all that much over the film's runtime. Sure, Barbie ends up a human (and gains genitalia somehow, implied by the final scene(?)), Ken becomes slightly more self-aware I guess, the Mattel execs just sort-of sway freely between Barbie-perpetuated matriarchy-proponents, and self-absorbed, blatant sexists, and Weird Barbie becomes de-ostracized, but apart from that, the rest serve as vessels for the film's message, simple and entertaining, but devoid of complexity. One character, Alan (played by Cera), did catch my attention, though I'll talk about him more in my criticisms down below. Another great thing I noticed was the movie's drama. I was actually surprised prior to watching, when I read, via Google, that its genres were Comedy/Drama, and upon watching, was pleasantly surprised. The film includes a few rather touching scenes, satisfying enough not to dull the tone, but serious enough to have impact on the viewer, and aren't plagued by cringy music, nor excessive jokes. They are raw, by all accounts. One such scene features Barbie sat on a public bench, shortly after realising that the world is not a matriarchal 'haven' like Barbie Land. As she cries (in a cowgirl-outfit, no-less), she notices an older woman sat across from her, and tearily declares her 'beautiful', playing on the film's themes of existence, ageing, and impending mortality. It serves as the heart of the movie, and was on-par with something one may expect to find in a more serious drama. Another includes Barbie's meeting with Ruth Handler's ghost(?) in the Mattel head-office, which is later complimented by another, which is laden with innocuous jokes about Ruth's tax-evasion scandals, and holds a more comedic tone.Now, earlier, I praised the film's use of veiled political undertones, but I also believe there were some that didn't quite work. Firstly, I am not sure what message the film was actually pedalling. It certainly wasn't feminism, as many seem to think. Sure, many scenes involve strong women, demonized men (we don't all catcall, sexually harass, or otherwise dominate women in our daily lives), and a somewhat functional matriarchy (only functional for the women), but the film also seems pretty critical of neo-feminist beliefs and ideals. It quite blatantly criticises the matriarchy, in that all of the men are oppressed and exist only to fawn over the women who don't want them, and shows that nonconventional Barbies (Weird Barbie) are ostracized and bullied for deformities which they can't help. Though, it also criticises the patriarchy, in that, nearly every man in the movie sexually objectifies women (to the degree of fetishising them by putting them in skimpy maid outfits), the women that support the patriarchy are all 'brainwashed', and must be 'reprogrammed' in order to have them rebel, and that the patriarchs are all somewhat stupid, or callow. What was the aim?Elsewise, the republicans are certainly minced throughout. Donald Trump symbology, criticism of traditionalist ideals, and the emphasis on cast-diversity certainly sees to this (the cast has multiple black people, latin-americans, and a lesbian, in Kate Mckinnon, amongst other represented minorities). Though, the character I mentioned earlier, Alan, seems to criticise those who are democrats (Left-wing works), in that he is ostracized by the Kens, largely ignored by the Barbies, and seeks to escape, stating that no-one will care if an Alan gets into the real world. He is one of those 'no other character likes them' characters, and overall, manages to throw the film's message into disarray. There is no steadfast, discernable message as far as I can see, and all agendae are both furthered and criticised, with none that stick. As in the end, Barbie Land is still ruled matriarchally, and the Kens are still held in lower esteem by the Barbies, though, the real world is unchanged, and Mattel shows no signs of incorporating female leadership. Furthermore, the Kens never seem to gain any purpose, which was their whole goal. As far as I can tell, they get no dreamhouses, no equality, no horses, no jobs, and no love (</3). This didn't ruin the film for me, by any means, and I still herald it as the best one I've watched this year so far (I am to watch Oppenheimer soon), but it does make me wonder what Gerwig and Baumbach really had in mind.Overall, the film was great, and I would recommend it for all, as long as they can take a joke, don't hate women, don't hate men, and aren't perturbed by politics. It is witty, fun, touching, and hilarious, sated with fantastic performances and easily palatable characters. I give this film an 8/10, and will definitely watch it again."
"I love that this movie is as others put it ""preachy"". I feel that with the current climate and so many young ladies losing freedoms and not realizing how far women have come in the past 60 years we need reminding how quickly it can all go away, lest young ladies today get too comfortable.There is a lot in this movie about mother/daughter relationships, women's roles in society and how hard it is to be a woman in a society that expects perfection. It is also fun, some great jokes, and Rhea Pearlman really made such a wonderful appearance. When Barbie first came out, it was a time when women didn't have as many options as they do now, women couldn't even have credit! I feel like this movie is a nod to what Barbie is supposed to stand for but also for the ways Barbie has fallen short."
"Great film which has a good balance between politics, feminism and film making. It was funny, sad and exciting, with great acting to pull it off. The set was incredible and the dances were amazing which really added to the story line. The ending was perfect and showed how barbie has impacted audiences positively and negatively. Mattel really own the so called bad barbies that they discontinued and it is clear either why they were discontinued but also maybe why they weren't necessary to be discontinued. Overall a great film and good to see with the family, it would be really recommended if you have younger children! They should love it."
"The Barbie movie is an okay movie for kids and adults alike. The first half of the movie is somewhat engaging and entertaining. However, the later half of the movie after Barbieland is not as good as the first half. The story becomes less interesting and the characters are not as well developed. The cinematography is still great but the plot becomes predictable and less engaging. Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves Barbie and wants to see a fun and entertaining movie. If you are looking for a movie with a great story and characters, then you might be disappointed with the later half of the movie."
"A good movie with an important message that is delivered in a way that makes it easy to understand and can resonate with alot of people. Hopefully the way they delivered the message leads people to see the issues they depict in the movie.I truly recomend this movie to everyone who likes ""kids"" movies that also has a good message. The way that the Barbie world was created leads the viewer to be sucked into the world of Barbie. Also the references and homages to other movies and also Barbie sets and movies really sets the cake.A bonus point is that all of Kens lines in the movie is comedy gold and made the whole theater giggle a few times."
"I didn't expect this! Saddest movie of all times told with Barbie dolls, jokes and a lot of pink!Cleverest movie ever made. I see how they made this movie to lock up in the cinemas huge numbers of people of all ages and genders and to forcefully OPEN THE EYES of those who still have them closed 😢EXTREMELY funny, beautiful, direct, but deeply sad movie 😢😢😢.Haters who rate this movie low are the mysoginists that would HATE for people of both genders to ever smarten up!People who say that the message was too direct, obviously don't know anything about art. You can't make a movie with BARBIE dolls and tell a SUBTLE message, you cannot, any artisticly inclined person knows this. I would have rated very low this movie if the message had been more subtle!!!!!!!"
"Wife forced me to see it with her. I had my doubts naturally, and really, a plastic toy movie for girls? I wouldnt watch He man either. I came in with very low expectations and came out thinking this was the best movie of the year thus far(havent seen Oppenheimer yet).Just a fantastic fun movie with a great soundtrack and honestly great moral story. This is dispite thinking what the Kens did to the Barbies was completely fair and not unprovoced with the end game of the movie being a bit puzzling as everything went back to the same as before with no lesson learned?I have 27 characters left to fill..Great movie though, worth a watch."
Gets you a typical Hollywood movie which feels good to watch but provokes you to think it helps you decide whether you want to be just influenced by the world around you the media the news and the industry which is grabbing your attention or do you want to accept that you are a human being with needs and wants and not just a piece of toy to be manipulated by the media.It begins with a simile of everybody's life that is Barbie land it is kind of our own sweet world which every human being prefers to live into rather than entering into the race of humans into the workforce and do the society etc and their Barbie and can reflect upon how different the real world can be from the world they're used to kind of like what happens to people of every kind I think this is a super movie too provoking people to think are they living to please the world around them or are they just living to live.
"Honestly, this is the best movie I've ever seen. The roles are so perfectly played and everyone did such a good job on this movie. I love it so much, came with a bunch of friends, my mom, their moms, and my little sister. Everyone said that they lived the movie. The ending made me cry but in such a good way, like how Barbie was when she experienced sadness for the first time. Seeing a movie that doesn't have the patriarchy spreader all over it is so refreshing, and honestly, if you're mad at this movie, you might be part of the problem. Seeing Ruth appear and give Barbie a talk was so amazing and such an emotional experience. I loved it so much I can't even explain. Seeing women even in movies come together and address problems is so refreshing.When the mom gave the speech about being a mom and a woman was so amazing and it had such a good message written into it.And can we talk about how well Will Ferrell played his role? And don't even get me started on Margot's acting. Literally amazing, she played her role so wellThis movie was a cinematic masterpiece to say nothing more. At the end when Barbie said her name (Barbara) was so amazing because she was originally named after Ruth's daughter, I loved that so much.And honestly I think that everybody needs to see this movie, no matter what your standpoint on life is, everyone needs to see this movie.And seeing a movie describe and mention how harmful the patriarchy is in such a funny way was absolutely amazing. I could go on and on about how good this movie made me feel but I would be here all day.It was such a good movie and I would definitely watch it again. Such a good watch."
"I thought the first half of the movie was hilarious and well done, but the last act of the movie is where it lost me. Instead of trying to communicate a message, it really felt like it was preaching way too much. Instead of showing, it tells you what to think in the last act of the movie.The only thing it has going for it is the set desing, wardrobe and music.Aside from tha the movie is plastic like the eponymous doll.The characters have no plot development, literal cliches.If you write characteres as abstractions , at least try to make into characters that are relatable to the viewer.Do not waste your time with this movie."
"(let me apologize for my english beforehand)
Oh my gosh... I don't even know where to start. I was very exited to watch this movie, and I decided to go see it for the first time with my best friend with whom I used to play barbies. However, I did not expected the movie to be so emotional: I cried in four different moments. In particular, the scene with the eldery woman on the bench makes me cry everytime I think about it! This movie touches a lot of parts about womanhood that we rearly get to see on the big screen, it critizes and in someways explains the patriarchy in a vey obvious way, whitch makes me think that the (mostly) men who are complaining about it have probably seen the movie with their eyes closed.Please, girls, go watch it with a woman you love, that makes you feel safe and let you be you, because this is an experience that needs to be shared with other women.It's one of the saddest movie I've ever seen, but somehow it filled me with hope. Now I'll go back crying about this movie while listening to ""what was i made for"" lol."
"Yes it was a bit preachy at times (the feminist speech that the mom/America Ferrera gave in the middle of the movie was out of place) but overall the message was ok and the movie was cute. I had some doubts about casting but Ryan Gosling killed it and Margot Robbie is obviously the closest to a real life Barbie you could get in the modern day.I'm not really sure the target age demographic either. I'm 17 and saw it with my mom and we both liked it, but idk it might not be great for super little kids. It's not overly vulgar or anything but at times it seems more focused on appealing to teenage girls and grown women.Also, Michael Cera is rad and probably the best part of the movie for me. His role is super fitting and it's fun to see him dressed all in pastel and pink, being a relatively normal dude in scenes full of Barbies."
"This thought-provoking movie is definitely not geared towards children or exclusively for girls; it's a must-watch for audiences of all backgrounds. It addresses delicate and fragile topics with precision. It was surprising and totally unexpected. Admittedly, the first half an hour is hard to get through, but you really get into it once you get the idea and you're totally consumed in it and already questioning yourself and the society before you realise. However, they could have concluded it better by finding a middle ground or presenting a solution to the problems addressed. Nevertheless, its overall impact makes it a must-see for everyone."
"At first. I had no interests in watching this movie. But my friends dragged me along. I do not regret using 1 hour and 54 minutes of my life on this movieSpoileralertThe filmmakers are luring us in with great actors and comedy. And then we get the real message hidden behind all that. Barbies world is gender opposite from the real world. Here are all barbies winners, leaders and the important. They are main characters in life and in the movie. In the real world it's mostly men instead. The Ken's (men) are presented as stupid, sexy, and not so important characters. Just they way women mostly are presented as in the most movies. As in the real world. When women realize how the difference in gender views affect their life. They take action. The Ken's does that in movie too. The Ken's went overboard and did not hesitate to downgrade the barbies to sexy women who only can grab a beer for them and even took their homes, positions and jobs. The barbie movie are really about genders, and showing us a world where the gender roles and vision are completely switched. The Ken's are the women of real world.I think barbie is an legendary movie who really shows how many women experience the world. And as every comedy it is a hidden message there. But in barbie it is much stronger. So for some people who don't enjoy lessons. The movie is might not for you. But for thoose who are open minded and enjoy something new. This is the movie for you.The only thing I did not enjoy about the movie is that the leaders in the board of barbie organization was made way too stupid. It would actually be better if they were in normal intelligence state. Ofc with normal intelligence they would still try to make barbie go in the box, and not think too much about Ken on the loose."
"I thought all the jokes were really funny and I felt a bit sorry for Ken while all the barbies rule barbie world all ken (Ryan gosling) wants is to be noticed by barbie (Margot Robbie) and when he goes to the real world and discovers that it's all about men and horses and he freaks out . I also loved the fact that all the barbies were not all skinny and blonde . I also thought that it was really sweet the way barbie met Ruth and Ruth was kind off like a mother to her and she helped her along the way in the movie . Everything was pink I can see how there was a shortage of pink paint . And it was really funny when the narrator was giving her opinion throughout the movie . So to all the cast, directors , producers and people involved well done . It was amazing. And it will give girls a lot off confidence for a long time .👏👏👏👏👏"
"It's a Barbie movie. It is as saccharine as Treacle and as empty as Barbie's head. A pink spectacle, and much like the doll, you can try to attach some accessories or throw on a doctor's coat or any array of add-ons you want. However, at the end of the day, it's a cheap children's toy, that any sane adult should ignore or only look upon as some bitter-sweet memento of a childhood that they will never regain.Throughout the build-up to the release of this film, I was led to believe that behind the gloss there was a deeper meaning to it. Greta Gerwig is regarded as an auteur, and the script was said to be too good to pass up. In the end, the message was too shallow to be impactful, the story too 'meta' to be taken seriously, and the dialogue as stiff as the plastic that Barbie is cast from for it to be any good. At least we know who the Real Barbie is for, but when I left the theatre I had no idea who the film is for or what it was really trying to say. It's not exactly a kids' film. It's not an intelligent art house film. It's not a summer action-packed blockbuster, it's not an interesting take on modern-day feminism, nor does it provide any sort of interesting commentary on any social or political issue. It is just a boring pink distraction."
"So many positive messages for women and men alike! Barbie has an existential crisis and Ken embraces the worst of the patriarchy. Both just seeking deeper meaning - what were they made for? Meaningful subtext while being wildly entertaining!All the acting was just delightful! Ryan Gosling even steals the show - though every performance was spot on. Thanks to Greta Gerwig and Mattel for an innovative, thought provoking, gloriously vibrant extravagant movie watching experience. It is destined to be a classic.Even better, it has stirred up controversy that hopefully can lead to discourse on the themes embedded in something with such great entertainment value."
"Barbie is a really refreshing movie! Directed with a truly unique style that brings the Barbie universe to life, it tackles deep topics (gender issues, consumerism...) with a lot of humor. It opens a lot of interesting conversations in a very new way, switching perspectives to let the viewer experience the irony of the world we live in today.The only downside is that you have to close those doors, and that leads to a more cliche/expected wrap up of the story that takes away some of the uniqueness brought by the movie.Overall, a very recommended watch and a guilty pleasure for years to come!"
"This movie was everything that was expected of it. It was funny, feministic, cute, beautiful and everything plastic. It was probably expected by many that the movie would be very superficial and focus more on the fun side of barbie, but it surprised us. This movie took a deep dive into what it is to be a girl and a woman in today's society and in the patriarchal world we live in today. It also brought into daylight the problematic history surrounding the plastic doll with many humorous elements. The only thing that brought this film down from a 10/10 was that it was everything we expected, and was missing a surprising plot twist. All in all I really recommend to watch this movie, it was a wonderful experience in the cinema!"
"I believe that everyone who said it was preachy just doesn't get it, the joy and pain this movie brought me makes it such a wonderful piece of art. The pacing of the movie was excellent as well. I never found myself checking the time waiting for it to end, i was engaged throughout. The comedy in the movie is very well done it felt fresh and not coming across as trying to hard. For me the best part was the end, that beautiful montage of women the cast and crew submitted to remind us that these women are all around us everyday and that we need to love eachother most of all. I will definitely watch it again."
"I never would have gone to see this movie if it weren't for a friend showing up to a party and telling me that it was a masterpiece. She described it as high art, which to me is high praise. After seeing it, I agree. It has all of the qualities of high art in that it is bound to be confusing to some, interpreted differently, and will inspire great feelings positive and negative depending on the viewer.Barbie gives you every opportunity to come in thinking you will be getting the silly quirky female equivalent of the Marvel universe. Vapid problems, absurdity, boys, and a classical formulaic movie arc. And it some ways it does keep to that.But all of those things are overshadowed by the philosophical discussion taking place. The director shows two worlds in juxtaposition: The Barbie Universe and the real world in present day. Matriarchy and Patriarchy.By removing a sense of consequence from the lives and decisions of the characters from the Barbie universe, it instead is able to engage on the philosophical level. A good comparison is 'The Good Place.' Characters don't have to act or respond realistically, instead characters respond thoughtfully and in accordance with the philosophical archetypes they represent.The Barbie universe is made to be perfect for the women that run that society, the Kens are riddled with need for validation. They hold no power of their own and Barbies have no incentive to share it.Through some plot vehicles, Barbie and Ken come to the real world. In one of the most important scenes of the film, Barbie and Ken walk down Venice Beach arriving from their strange plastic universe. For the first time the ultimately empowered Barbie is ogled and cat-called and made to feel unsafe, and the ultimately disempowered Ken is made to feel respected just for being alive.I think this specific scene is really important because it's at the center of understanding the context for modern feminism. The simple difference between navigating walking down the street as a woman vs a man. Our world feels qualitatively different depending on who we are. Our feelings of safety and security in the public can differ wildly depending on what body we inhabit.Cheekily, the film is made for the female gaze. All men in the film are shown as being vapid and thoughtless both in the Barbie universe and the real world. I feel that this was an intentional decision to cause feelings of discomfort in men that watch. It serves to both flip the standard movie script (that has been improving in recent years) where it has been normal for female characters to be accessories to a plot and eye-candy for the male viewer and not ends in themselves, and also to make similarities between male viewers and Ken sting a bit. As a male viewer and musician I felt a painful twinge when Ken says ""let me play music at you"" It caused me to wonder how much space I take up socially with my music, and aware of how playing music when it's not expressly desired can have a way of shutting down vulnerable conversation. Similarly the depictions of male to male empowerment felt familiar caricatures with a grain of truth to them.As the conflict ends and Barbie world returns to Matriarchy the film ends on a thoughtful tone. In both worlds the subjugated sex needs to fight for power being ungenerously allotted to them by the ruling sex. With a clear message that nobody wants either of these worlds, that in discarding the feelings of the unempowered denizens of our world we create a weak foundation, that true acceptance and understanding of these issues comes from letting in our full mortal nature and the realities that come with being human. That being messy, complex, and sexual beings is what gives meaning to this world and what is called for in any conversation on equality and class disparity.Despite our expectations, Barbie, isn't dumb. It reflects a lot of thought and understanding of the current moment. It uses archetypes and simple forms to discuss real issues in the zeitgeist today. It discusses the problems with Barbie as a brand, with some formulations of feminism, with patriarchical society and what is does to women's understandings of themselves.Barbie represents an awareness that far surpasses anybody's expectations of the intellectual property it represents, and is worth the uncomfortable and somewhat depressing nature of the film for the dialog it opens up."
"What can I say? I went into this expecting at least a few laughs. The trailers didn't even show or come close to reveal the heart of the plot. So here it is:
Everything is so horrible and wrong for women today, and most men hate women. Now, as a woman watching this movie, I felt as if I was supposedly being told how much my life as sucked, and how much men have stolen from me. Which is not at all the case. I've had the pleasure of working with men who respect me in a good career, and found the movie distastefully disrespectful of everything I've ever accomplished.I had a few laughs, but found the movie lacking a sense of real purpose and direction. It seemed as though it was seeking to inform everyone about this new agenda that women should be in charge of everything. Wow, sounds like sexism to me. I'd prefer equality, which is something that we currently have."
"This movie is an easy 10/10 for me, did not disappoint. The casting, the directing, the plot, the cinematography, the sets, the detail, the acting, the jokes, it was all perfect. I want to rewatch this movie already! I watched it with my family and it is definitely enjoyable for everyone, the kids might not understand the movie as much but my sibling still really enjoyed it. This movie made me laugh and cry, it focuses on womanhood and mother daughter relationships in both a light hearted and sad way. I have absolutely no complaints about this movie whatsoever, absolutely loved it and recommend."
"Barbie was an extremely fun movie that was entertaining and funny throughout the entire runtime of the movie. The jokes were witty, funny, well-written and did not impede on the tone of any serious moments. Barbie was for sure targeted for kids but made for adults to enjoy just as much as the little ones. The casting was phenomenal, every actor embodied their character, Margot Robbie is dynamite in her role delivering every line with sincerity and real feeling. Ryan Gosling was the epitome of Ken, fun, and lovable but he was also able to sublimely deliver emotions that one would not associate with Ken. With 2 powerful stars you would think that the secondary characters would be unnoteworthy, but Simu Liu, and Will Ferrell command the screen so remarkably, not to mention every other Barbie and Ken, and Allen too. All of this without even mention the cinematography and the breathtaking music which culminates into a delightful story that impressively tackles pretty serious issues."
"I went to see the movie with the feeling it was being hyped to much and with not so high expectations, -even though I admire Greta Gerwig a lot- but not even fifteen minutes into the movie I was already laughing and crying and hooked. It is definitely one of the funniest I've seen in at least 2 years, it has a simple storyline that works exactly as it suppose to without trying to be something else. The message is powerful and easy to understand, I found it refreshing and truthful, sometimes it may feel even a bit naive, but in the end it is what it is and I appreciated that. The performances are really delightful and full of small nuances that make them easy to connect with, even though the tone is satiric and farcical. Great movie, a lot more than I expected."
"Wow is all I can say. So many layers that had my daughter and I smiling, laughing, and sobbing all at the same time. Absolute perfection. So brilliantly written. Everyone should see this movie. It was amazing!!! Aspects for generations of women to submerge themselves in and was also full of a beautiful nostalgia for all the little girls inside of us, and those still growing up. I can not say enough good things about this movie. Though some may not enjoy the truths behind what this movie stands for it was a true testament to our current state of the world and what weve had to deal with for forever. Again just absolutely brilliant."
"This movie is amazing. It perfectly describes womanhood in a way few movies that I've seen has. It shows how different women and men are treated and also the feeling of growing up as a woman. I started to miss all my childhood Barbies that we gave to my little cousin now. It's also completely hilarious and the cast is absolutely perfect. Almost No one else could play Barbie and Ken as good as Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling has. Even though it's technically about Barbie's DOSENT MEAN that it's aimed for children. It's perfect for women of all ages, and for men to learn more about what it's like to simply grow up and simply exist as a woman."
"I've just taken 2 nieces, 9 and 14, to see Barbie. They both hated it... really, really hated it!! And, me: I'm just stunned. I've no idea what I've just seen.If Barbie is meant to be a dark satire, it's alright. If it's meant to be a kids movie, it's unconscionably bad. And, I'm totally confused which type of movie it's supposed to be. What the literal heck is going on!!If you're looking for a twenty first century dark cultural satire, you're at least in your twenties, you've an open mind, this is your movie... maybe. If you're looking for a movie to take your kids to, before getting ice cream, this is absolutely not the movie you're looking for. My advice: give Barbie a miss and go straight for the ice cream. You will be so much happier. I wish I had."
"It strikes generational emotional strings, the grace and charm reflected in honing in a clean performance. Delight to watch, and it will make you laugh and cry.The mystique of mixing cultures and making people laugh was phenomenal.The performances by Margot Robbie and new faces the supporting cast are all stunning. Support team Margot andthe extendable those who decided to play the other roles, in something so complex for the satisfaction of an entire world.The soundtrack should have been better articulated. Some of the songs are forgettable. Choreography is also a bit lacking and bad..."
"With a production by Mattel it self it's an amazing marketing idea to invite, the critical young thinkers of this generation, to the brand. With lots of self criticism, the movie give other vision about the atual demand of what the Barbie doll always should be.The movie jokes with the patriarch world we live and also shows a subtil criticism over it with the ""other side"". Almost like - Equilibrium should win this battle.Jokes about the masculinity and the critics themselves, showing a child who critic the old Barbie fans at the same time as she itself is a ""Barbie"" of the new era.At the same time brings us, the main public (early 90s under) all the nostalgic memories of playing dolls. That should be soft but people are always trying to be something else.Great deal."
"I am not kidding, the movie was hilarious, self aware, touching, camp, beautiful, it was everything. My friend told me it was rare to hear me laugh so much, next to us was a couple and the bf was also dying from laughter. The ""this movie is not for me"" means that you maybe are close minded, if you go to see anything with prejudice, you will more likely not enjoy it. I think it is fair if it isn't your cup of tea but don't review bomb the movie, there nany famous movies that are not for me but i don't think they are bad. Why can't women, mothers and daughters have something for them? All those 1 star reviews are disgusting. I recommend to put the pinkest thing you own and enjoy the movie, i am glad i watched her."
"I went to this movie without watching previews or expecting anything. This movie turned out to be everything a Barbie-loving thirty-something needed twenty years ago. Expertly cast, the Barbie movie is hilariously self-aware and has no dull moments. Though the Micheal is obviously mainly about Barbie, Ken has his own moment to shine that ends up being the subplot.The movie was beautiful visually and funny from beginning to end. The attention to detail was clear and the storyline had the theater crying happy tears by the end. Definitely see it if you are a parent and take your parent friends with you. Make sure you wear pink ;)We would see it again and again!"
"I definitely went in with doubts, as one does with the mass market films of day; but this was overwhelmingly more than good. It was the first actually great big box film I've seen in some time.I should've known. Greta Gerwig, with her smart indie-film whit, created something for everyone. Easy jokes. Clever jokes not everyone will latch onto. Even physical humor to get the kids cackling.All with a great message about finding the value in one's uniqueness at its core. Loved the self-poking Mattel allowed with that tax jokes.I will forever be saying ""Get in the box Jezebel."" Heck, it may even replace ""Get in losers. We're going shopping.""Mark of a real success."
"I felt the story was missing a lot. There were a lot of points but they all were poorly placed.I'm disappointed. But amazing outfits.The actors were very good.Ryan as always very good. Margot also amazing .They tried to be unpredictable, but they failed because there was at the end literally no point.I didn't understand the whole Ken tragedy. It was way too much.The feminist story was way too old, i mean women have passed these points and criticism. We are not fighting for how our body should be look anymore. The fight is bigger than that. The movie was way too superficial. The first half hour was amazing tho."
This movie is excellent. Funny & brilliant throughout.Margot Robbie is sensational. Ryan Gosling is excellent. The script is superb. The visuals are incredible. The outfits are spectacular. The music is fabulous. The dance scenes are fun! All the details from the pink slide through to the nods to all the retired Barbie friends are so wondrous & nostalgic. It's truly truly a brilliant movie.A week after seeing it I'm still thinking about it.When was the last time people dressed up to see a film?!It's a truly remarkable movie. And deserving of a multitude of Oscars.Stop reading reviews and just watch it.
"This is such a unique film! It was so much fun, and had its sweet moments as well! All the choreography was excellently done. The costumes were amazing! I also loved the take Greta had on barbie, and some real problems women and men face. I truly feel like this was such a special movie- and it does not feel like anything I have ever seen before. It was also very funny! (And that's coming from someone who does not like comedy's) I was giggling all the way through the movie. So sad that this gets so much hate, I just feel like it's such a fun movie that everyone should see. So much fun!! Greta Gerwig has done it again!"
Very good felt like it dragged a but at the end for me which brings the marks down. But overall a very good film with good and enjoyable characters and plot line. Good aspects of comedy in some moments with a good soundtrack to partner with the film. I enjoyed the scenes in barbie land the most but that's not to say the scenes in the real world weren't enjoyable. It wasn't what I expected it to be in a good way. It clearly didn't have a mainly child audience which made it a lot more enjoyable. I loved watching how barbie and Ken adapted to the real world compared to barbie land and how mainly reacted to things that she can't do in barbie land like drinking.
"The ""Barbie Movie"" brings to life the beloved doll in a delightful and empowering animated adventure that will enchant audiences of all ages. Directed by a talented team, the film embraces the essence of Barbie's timeless charm while weaving a heartwarming tale that inspires and entertains. From the opening scene, the film captures attention with its vibrant and enchanting animation. The world of Barbie is beautifully realized, boasting breathtaking landscapes, colorful settings, and meticulously designed characters. The attention to detail in every frame adds depth to the storytelling, immersing viewers into Barbie's fantastical universe."
"Wasn't sure how it would go however so much funnier then i expected, and definitely more of an adult film then i expected too, thought it was going to be aimed at the barbie loving 4 year olds however lots of laugh's throughout both jokes and other little subtle jokes like the CEO with his pink drum sticks and not being able to get through the locked gate with his swipe card as Barbie hops over the top and loved how it flipped between Barbie world and the normal world. Would highly recommend and would totally go back and see again and buy once out. Loved how everyone also gets in barbie theme and go dressed in pink."
"I was expecting so much maybe.The only thing I like is when Ruth appears and we felt the connection mother daughter and when we used to play together.The cast was good but the movie so randomly weird, non sense, nothing you would expect from such a cool director.Visuals ok, but come on, it is such a waste of time and money.The argument gets totally lost, there is no line to follow up.Without Gosling or Robbie this movie would be one of the worst in history.Pretty interesting you can see all the barbie types, all the Ken too but to be honest, in our times we need more content. This movie only reminded me why is so hard to be a woman and perfection expected."
"In this movie you can see deep meaning sense of live, you need to know just little things before or to be open mind and the whole univers will show appear for you. Most of scenes have a hidden or deep mening, i am not going to write too much about movie because i am here to sustain Greta Gerwing and i am very grateful for her because she had the creep to made it. Maybe more director will do movies for our souls not just for action,adventure,etc...For me it was the greatest movie who I saw it ever. Any people should see through rows and see the true meaning of the movie. All my best to the Greta Gerwig <3."
"My childhood was spent with Barbie, Barbie's films and dolls, bag, clothes and notebook...and now I'm so happy and grateful. Watching this movie tooks me back to my sweet childhood memories. Everything was that I expected. Pink world and lots of beautiful Barbie's and handsome Ken's gathered together. And it's interesting that just as we played with our dolls, the Barbies in the movie were also taken into play! Then one of my childhood dreams that was Barbie in the real world came true and it was interesting to me...
How wonderful it is that Margot Robbie was chosen to perform this role.. She did it perfectly."
"I really enjoyed the satirical approach that was employed in Barbie. It poked fun at Barbie World but, also delivers a message of empowerment and individuality. I laughed and was throughly entertained. It's a great movie for mothers and their tween, teen or adult daughters.I would recommend this movie to anyone that played with Barbies and Kens. It explored and poked fun at all aspects of the Barbie universe: Mattel, Barbie's perfect life and appreance, Barbie's many professions, Ken's dependency on Barbie, Patriarchy, Feminism, Barbie and Ken's clothes, their houses, cars, their fake food, pools, water, beaches, what happens to dolls that get mistreated. It's a great movie! Well done!"
"Because of some reviews I thought that the movie was bad and innapropriate. But when I saw it I got shocked with the important and deep subjects that the movie talked about, and at the same time, I enjoyed the way that they talked about those sensitive subjects. I liked the way that they the movie had sad partes but that were funny and I liked the way that even when things were serious, they put them in an hilarious way.I enjoyed the end, because it ended up well to Ken and to Barbie, and everyone got happy.I hope that Ken finds his person and I would really like a continuation of this movie."
"This movie captures the frustrating yet wonderful feeling of being a woman in this world more than any other film I feel so seen and acknowledged. I ended up crying as the credits rolled just because I felt like all the emotions I couldn't put into words and no one could ever understand were said in this film. This is a movie for everyone, not just women, it makes us reflect about power roles and how we should all work together towards a more equal world for all.Unlike what some people might believe it is not ""anti men"" the whole point of Ken's story line is how he learns toxic masculinity is dangerous, not only for women but for men as well and just end up causing harm. In the end he learns he is more than just a partner and must find meaning in his life being his own person. I don't understand in what world that message is ""anti men""."
"Barbie represents opression of women all around the world ruled by men. Ken represents manhood without capitalism or without a genital... blah blah blah...This movie should not have been a political satire. It should have been a fantasy romance comedy musical such as Entangled or Disney movies. I left the movie theater after its first 30 minutes so if this one didn't turn out to be a masterpiece in the remaining 1:30 hour of its runtime I had much more funtime wandering under hot sun than watching Barbie...Robbie and Gosling are as good as they could get with this absurd writing and directing.My rating is 3/10 only for the sake of its starting level production staff, PA, Gathering servants who worked for minumum union wage."
"One of the most affectionately crafted and truly hilarious films of all time!Usually, a slight exhale through my nose is enough for me to classify a movie as funny but 'Barbie' had me laughing loud enough to annoy the whole cinema. It was jam-packed with line after line after line of hilarity - I couldn't even get a chance to catch my breath! Greta Gerwig's script had me snorting and crying from laughter, especially when paired with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling's flawless delivery of it.'Barbie' was full of such in-touch and specific references that the whole audience could relate to. From the Kens mansplaining 'The Godfather' to the inclusion of Weird Barbie who'd been ""played with too hard"", Gerwig made the film feel highly personal, which is quite a feat considering the impersonal nature of the subject of the movie.But it was more than just a comedy; the film touched on much deeper themes of feminism and existentialism. When Barbie left the matriarchy of Barbie Land and entered the Real World, the film acted as a political and social commentary on issues surrounding misogyny and womanhood. With Gerwig's depiction of not only what it means to be a woman, but also what it means to be human, she beautifully and skillfully brought the humanity to a plastic doll.The set design, casting, acting, writing and directing were all executed phenomenally and came together to create a poignant, multifaceted and rollicking movie. In Ken's wise words, it absolutely was ""sublime""!"
"Initially I wasnt so sure about how this movie would be, and whether it would overly focus on the idea of a Barbie doll, stopping it from extending to a resonant deep meaning. However, I was quickly proven wromg as we see the procession of Barbies life going from 'perfect' to 'realistic' showing us that we really are similar, makimg the movie much more pleasurable (in my eyes) and allowimg us to connect with her, them going to the human world and Ken going back with new ideas further related the movie to the real world as we felt some level of pity for Ken as he had been forced to feel this way for so long but also felt anger and confuaion as to why he was ruining this perfecr world woth clearly dysfunctional ideas, given that he knew how it felt. The ending was very satisfying as it brought closure to the topic at hand and also taught audiences a true lesson about society and the world generally, elevating it from a simple childish movie, without sacrificing the barbie feel with the various, sprinkles whimsical and funny moments which acted as a reset for the tone, without causing you to forget what had happened! A very good movie with a strong, well delivered message."
"""Barbie (22023)"" takes Barbie on an awesome space adventure, set in the future. The movie has stunning visuals as Barbie faces cosmic challenges with bravery and smarts. It teaches us the importance of understanding others and being true to ourselves.The film gives a fresh twist to the classic Barbie story, with an exciting intergalactic journey. Barbie makes new alien friends and learns about empathy and unity, making strong bonds across time and space. The movie's message is heartwarming, encouraging us to be ourselves and embrace change as we follow Barbie's cosmic encounters.""Barbie (22023)"" reminds us why Barbie is a role model, inspiring people with her charm and never-give-up attitude. It's an inspiring adventure that stays with you, showing us the power of believing in ourselves and growing. Get ready for a fun and futuristic ride that brings back the magic of Barbie in an amazing new way, keeping the timeless spirit alive for generations to come."
"I agree that the film is contrary to the feminist narrative. So much so that in Barbieland women rule everything and Barbie didn't want to stay there at the end of the movie, preferring real life. The men of Barbilândia, built by women, were useless and bananas, without an 'I'. This is dealt with in one of the final scenes.I thought the film brought up very deep reflections that people didn't understand. According to the film, the world of patriarchy is imperfect and so is the feminist world.The scenes of Ken declaring himself to Barbie are reminiscent of poets and their muses. At no point does he make an apology for ideology...The film is intelligent with impeccable performances."
"Okay I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's funny, it's charming, and also manages to make you cry. It reminds me of the kind of movie that becomes a cult classic years later, like Napoleon Dynamite or Drop Dead Gorgeous. It's definitely not for everyone, but in my opinion the wacky bounce between spoof and serious makes it wildly entertaining. This isn't a movie to take seriously, but it is definitely thought provoking. It's take on feminism and the patriarchy is displayed in a way that is almost making fun of itself. And I think that's nice, because the movie displays a message that everyone should be equal, living a life in a patriarchal society isn't great, but neither is one designed for women. Like The Importance of Being Earnest, it nods to the problems of the world in a comedic way, making it easier to digest.My only annoyance about this film is a bit of a spoiler, so read no more if you don't want to be spoiled (I definitely recommend watching this movie btw)Ken was bashed in this movie. He was treated like garbage, and it makes me sad. The poor guy didn't know how to be happy without Barbie liking him. The guy needs a hug and a better girlfriend. Cause Barbie was kind of a jerk to him in this movie. It irked me because no one would like that aspect if the roles were reversed. Anyway, watch this movie if you want to be entertained by a wacky plot and great underlying message."
"In which Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach recycle their failed 30 minute Black Mirror idea and pad it out to a full two hour shaggy dog tale, of little or no consequence, whilst breaking the hearts of nine year old girls worldwide who flock in their millions to a movie that flies straight over their heads.To be fair the first three minutes are awesome when they pastiche 2001 A Space Odyssey (but we'd already seen it in the trailer). And Margot Robbie is breathtakingly beautiful from start to finish.Ryan Gosling's faye Ken is, by contrast, just a bit annoying, (and to be fair, so is Robbie) but neither are as gratingly garbage as Will Ferrell and his bunch of Mattel men.Other highlights include Billie Eillish's stunningly gorgeous closing music which gets all existential on us.The design is, to a point, quite fun but not consistently so and the morale of the story, or the political polemic about equal rights for women, does not fail to land, although it does so in a Groundhog sort of manner.This is not a good movie. Gerwig, Baumback, Robbie and Gosling have all done significantly superior work. This is quite simply a bunch of talented people having a laugh and getting away with it.Hats of to Mattel for allowing a lot of self deprecation on their part and to the profits it will have raised for their mighty corpioration.But is this good cinema? No, it is not."
"I thought the movie was amazing. Full of nuances.It is an incredible movie that goes in a completely different direction then I thought it would. I loved how they didn't shy from the perception of Barbie. Also, it was very well cast, the characters were all fantastic. This isn't just a ""girls"" movie, either! I absolutely loved it. I wouldn't change a thing. I laughed, I cried, I was entertained the entire movie. The jokes were intelligent and a bit edgy. It may look like a silly action adventure, but textured dialog and rapid-fire gags add important layers of meaning. Great actors - great way of portraying silly messages and wonderful way of getting the important messages out as well. The movie had a great combination of humor and message.As someone else wrote in an editorial ""superficial yet smart, caustic yet clever, and showcasing not just the very best but even the worst of all things Barbie. No stone is left unturned and no doll is left behind."""
"There is literally nothing to not love about this movie. Timing, perfect. Comedy, perfect. Ryan Gosling? Also perfect. Please do yourself a favor and go see this movie or purchase it when it comes out. It's rare to see something that synthesizes nostalgia, the societal journey of growing up (that extends generations) and balances this with comedy. There is a reason this debuted so highly at the box office and I am certain this will solidify itself as a cultural centerpiece for film schools in the future. Not only does it highlight long existing issues that half of the population has to endure, it does so in a way that you feel seen and can see others."
"Well barbie (2023) movie actually out of my expectation, i know barbie always been supporting feminist but this time barbie movie showing us how being feminist without even makes men feels underestimated. So, the whole plot was perfectly wrapped by good spices and well-written.And i'm so happy miss Gretta had chosen Margot Robbie as Barbie, her face and body just like living Barbie. Despite on that, we understand that barbie always been so perfect but in this movie barbie was written as ""just like us"" and Margot perfectly suit into this character also Ryan Gosling as Ken, His character is so funny and i really enjoyed it."
"Thank you for this movie ! It's beautiful by the décor, costumes and music, but so much more beautiful with the message. We do need that kind of movie in our world.People (men, lol) seems to be confused after seeing the Barbie movie. Maybe it's time to accept the world as it is now and understand how cruel it could be for the half of the world population. I think you are proving the point of the movie.We do need more movies like Barbie, that can keep the funny in important messages. In many movies, they need violence, rudeness and/or vulgarity to show how the female character is in pain. Thanks to Barbie, we don't have to see this to know, we don't have to be triggered to understand what kind of feelings she is going through. Barbie is like us. Barbie is for us. Thank you, Barbie !"
"The entire film I was thinking ""Literally me."" It is a perfect movie in every way, the choreography was absolutely stunning it was fantastic. This movie beats out Oppenheimer in every way possible, me and the boys pulled up to Barbie excited! Will Ferrell was pretty good too as well as all the actors. The Kens dancing as well as all the horses brought tears to my eyes. Also the best part I have to say is at the very end the Barbie song by Ice Spice it slapped I had to watch the credits just to listen to the song. 10/10 would recommend. This film was perfect in every way down to each and every frame."
"I honestly cannot understand those rating on here. The first half ot the movie is exactly what I expected from a barbie movie; it's fun, it's pink and it was just a great watch but then (oh lord) the second half started. Although I understand that the producers try to address certain issues in society but this has absolutely no place in a Barbie movie. I don't really enjoy it when a highly extravaganted issues is being shoved into my face. I honestly cannot understand how the producers thought that's the way to do it. It leaves a bitter taste behind and destroys the good vibes from the beginning of the movie. I'm extremely disappointed."
"When I heard that a ""Barbie"" movie was coming out, I had absolutely no intention of seeing it, never mind watching it in an actual movie theatre. I had every Barbie doll as a young girl in the 60's, even Allen. Barbie was definitely NOT my role model, and I am thankful for the live women who were. My daughter went to see it with friends last week and convinced me to see it, because it wasn't what I would expect. I am so glad that I did not wear mascara! I was in tears laughing yet totally moved by the message. A movie that is both inspiring and funny is truly rare. The cast and the message were perfect. Talk about ""Girl Power""!"
"Went with my friend to see Barbie for her birthday and now we're both having existential crises about being woman and growing up.I knew Barbie was going to be a laugh. I knew it was going to be a little emotional. But what i didn't expect was for it to completely rip my heart out and stick it back in my chest!Greta Gerwig has a truly beautiful soul and she has a very unique way of expressing that that really resonates with me and many other people especially women. She always knows how to pull off that intense third act monologue about being a woman that hits you right in your soul and causes you to rethink everything.I have never seen a movie that explains how exhausting it is to be a woman not only around men, but around other women. America Ferrera, who plays Gloria, has a insanely heartfelt beautiful monologue where she says ""i'm just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us"" and i have never felt something deeper in my heart.Never thought i'd say this but this movie absolutely changed my life and i will love it for life."
"In this unexpected cinematic journey, ""Barbie"" takes a seemingly simple premise-a movie based on a kids' toy-and ventures into surprisingly profound territory. As a casual viewer, I found myself immersed in a tapestry of classic movie references woven seamlessly throughout the film. While some nods might have eluded me, I couldn't help but appreciate the directorial finesse in incorporating influences from cinematic legend Stanley Kubrick. These nods operated on both an artistic and nostalgic level, striking a chord with audiences of different backgrounds.The film's narrative commences with a robust start, drawing viewers into its vibrant world. However, I must admit that the conclusion seemed to lose some of its initial impact. Nevertheless, the overall experience was enjoyable, taking me and my family on an entertaining ride. Speaking of family, watching it with my wife and two sons added an enriching dynamic to the experience.Interestingly, the film defies convention by tackling thought-provoking themes that resonate with older audiences. My eldest son, at the tender age of ten, astutely observed the movie's poignant reflection on the fragility of life, encapsulated in its exploration of anxiety, depression, and mental health. Such profound subjects might fly over the heads of younger viewers, leaving them with a cheerful and colorful impression of the film. However, those of us inclined to ponder deeper meanings will uncover layers beyond what we'd typically anticipate from a movie based on a kids' toy.The comedic elements, particularly those featuring the talented Will Ferrell, added to the film's overall charm, though I'd refrain from labeling them exceptional. For me, the true allure lay in the film's willingness to embrace darker themes, which lent it an intriguing edge. Comparing it to ""Rick and Morty"" instead of ""Super Mario Bros"" feels more apt, highlighting the movie's unexpected depth and complexity.In conclusion, ""Barbie"" is a fascinating cinematic endeavor that defies preconceived notions. While rooted in a kids' toy, the film boldly delves into thought-provoking subjects, inviting a diverse audience to partake in its unexpected layers. Whether you're in it for the nostalgic references, the comedic interludes, or the contemplative exploration of life's complexities, ""Barbie"" manages to leave an impression that's both delightful and introspective."
"This movie was a great way to redefine what Barbie stands for teenagers, and adults - as well. It was a great way to open up a thoughtful conversation with kids, and adults about common world problems.Nowadays, Barbie is held at a standard of just being pink, and girly, and frilly. But this movie did such a great job redefining it, showing how the barbie universe was so relatable in the most unlike of ways was mind-blowing.Aside from the movie addressing things like feminism, patriarchy, matriarchy, self-esteem, etc. Barbie brings up an array of positive character development traits throughout; one of the main, was how in the beginning of the movie - she was settled with her life and didn't want anything to change. And during the middle, didn't want to take any accountability or initiative when the Ken's took over. But, as the movie progressed, it didn't a great job of showing Barbie taking action, solving problems, AND making life changing decisions.There is so much good to address in the movie. For the people who didn't get the point of it, they HAVE to rewatch it with an open mind. Because there is so much to unpack in it; the cast, the music, the script."
"I absolutely adored this movie, without spoilers I can say it's truly fun and surprisingly a lot deeper than you would initially think going into it. Beyond that I thought the cinematography was fantastic and the color palette was perfect, and above all else the acting was amazing from everyone in it! Especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, I know people were hesitant to accept him as Ken but he really knocks it out of the park, and I honestly cannot believe they considered people other than Margot Robbie to be Barbie. It's like she was BORN for this role. Absolutely adored this movie and I hope no one listens to the review bombing, it really is a treat!!"
"Maybe I will be perceived as one of those insecure middle-aged men who is ""terrified"" of women, as labeled by another poster on here, but I assure you, I'm not.First of all, I'm gay, so I'm just here to provide a more unbiased and alternative look at the reality of what the world is nowadays when it comes to what I see between men and women. Just because I'm gay doesn't mean I don't have s lot of straight friends and I've stood on the sidelines watching their lives play out quite often. And as I've offered my observations, I've had many a ""Barbie"" say, 'Yeah, I never thought of that,' when explaining how men think, and see things.Because remember as we move forward in this discussion, for every Barbie out there, there is a Ken too. And it would indeed be interesting to see the movie, ""Ken,"" come out next. And have it written by a man. And not a man who is just trying be progressive and accepted by women. But a man who truly will give Ken's side of the story too.So let's begin with the patriarchal thing. A deep and rather complex discussion to be sure.Is there still a patriarchal mentality going on in this world? Of course. And there will continue to be for some time to come. The world doesn't just do a 180 because some movie called Barbie comes out and relegates men to some sort of inconsequential joke.Nor did it immediately do a 180 just because women were becoming more vocal about their rights some 50+ years ago (even more when you consider the right to vote).Just because we're living in a time when it's more acceptable, and cool for women to take jabs at men, doesn't mean change will be enacted overnight. Especially in light of the fact that there are still women out there who aren't ""terrified"" (to use that poster's word) of men and are perfectly fine letting them take the lead in a relationship, protect them when necessary, and do the things that men have done in relationships since the beginning of time. Remember, patriarchal societies have been around since the beginning of time, and you can't blame men for doing what they ALSO have seen as being expected of them. Many of these expectations coming from women themselves. Whether they'll admit to it or not.For those who don't subscribe to the latter though, and want to become independent, and change that patriarchal trajectory, there are indeed alternatives. And I say, go for it. We're living in an age when women don't need men. They can be pretty much anything they want to be nowadays. Are there still ""ceilings"" to be shattered? Yes. But life really isn't that bad.And what about the Barbie body image thing. For decades we've heard women complain about that impossible image that Barbie dolls have set for women. But the reality is that most men don't expect that in a woman. Not nearly as much as women might pretend or believe they do. That's more of a socialized, media construct that comes as a result of what the Barbie doll, and more generally, Hollywood and print media have set up. In the day to day world though, that's not how it is when it comes to what men expect in women.Sure, men talk about good-looking women. They ogle women. Sometimes make a catcall or two. But women talk about good-looking men too. And when a good-looking man walks in the room, there is no denying what the women in the room think of him. Hell, I saw Aladdin on Broadway and when he came out without his shirt on, muscles bulging, the women in the audience went nuts. And in the play Take Me Out during the shower scene with a bunch of hot young men naked in the shower scene, the women in the audience weren't exactly suppressing their murmurings and ""responses."" So come on!And to expand upon that, I worked at a major amusement park in Anaheim for almost ten years when I was younger. I was witness to thousands of couples. And I can tell you that I actually saw more couples where the man was better looking than the woman than I did where the woman was better looking than the man.So no, men don't expect perfection.Actually, from the observations I've made of women it would suggest that they do place a lot of importance on looks and physique when it comes to a man too. They can pretend that they don't, and that it's the men who have these impossible expectations of women, but it doesn't change the facts.In the movie, we see Barbie's perspective on things. So, this is how Ken sees it in the real world too: women want a man who is good looking, has a great body, has a full head of hair. And oh yeah, if he has a lot of money, even better.And add to that you have women who have special interests such as a man in uniform;. Or a younger man. I have female friends who will only date a guy in uniform. Etc.So do women really want to play that ""expectations"" card?I wouldn't suggest it. Because they are just as guilty as men. And any body self-image thing that women have is more Hollywood, and yes, Barbie-driven than what is the reality anyway. Because men are way more accepting than women claim them to be. Or I should say, straight men are. Gay men, not so much.I will even add that men are so accepting of women, that ageism isn't even the issue that women play it up to be. Women complain about men who only want a younger, hotter woman and that women ""age out"" and are not treated with the same respect. To that I say bull. Let's say my 50 year old female friend and I go out for dinner, and our waiter is some hot younger man. If my friend has a thing for younger men and hits on him, depending on the moment in time, that friend of mine might very well have a date for the night.I can tell you that as a gay male, that would not happen with that younger man if he was gay. If he played on my team and I made a play for him, there would only be a 5-10% chance I would have a chance at him. Because if you want to know what picky is, ask a gay man. Younger gay men won't hardly give the time of day to an older man.So straight women benefit from this as well. There is no such thing as becoming too old. There are plenty of younger men who are willing and I'll bet where I'd have a 5-10% with the dude if he played on my team, she'd have an 80-90% chance with him if he was straight. Older gay men will not see the same willingness in younger gay men that straight women do in younger straight men. And even if the younger guy wasn't interested in an older woman, he would treat her with respect. The younger gay man will very likely put the older man down.But I digress. Even though proven the point that women have nothing to complain about. Trust me.In closing, are there Ken dolls who only want Barbie? Sure. But that's not the majority.Do men appreciate a good looking woman with a nice body? Yes.But women appreciate the same in men too, so time to move on from that discussion. Both men AND women have expectations of the opposite sex.As to the patriarchal thing? Definitely a deeper and more complex subject.But still, things have changed a lot for women. I know that patriarchal societies have been around for a long time. They have been the ""norm"" so to speak. And again, a lot of women are actually still okay with that. They don't mind the man taking the lead in ther relationship, protecting them, etc.But for those who don't subscribe to that, women can now be the VP of the USA, or the prime minister or president of whole countries. We almost had a female president here in the States. Women can be CEOs, and even directors of movies. Some of the wealthiest people on this earth are women. All kinds of opportunities.Even the opportunity to get your degree, get a nice job, and find a husband who has a lot of money, is totally hot, wears a uniform, is younger, or whatever. If the latter are your things too.Women have nothing to complain about. Looks, age, none of it matters as much as you think it does. For women, the Barbie syndrome may exist, but reality would suggest otherwise.Now boo hoo for me, all of that really DOES matter when you're gay. LOL. Or COL (cry out loud). Whatever the case may be."
"I'm not a Barbie fan girl in the least, but I think this has become one of those movies I will cherish. Those who were offended that they stereotyped men and made so many of them ""weak"" or ""stupid"" in this movie are seriously missing the point. They stereotyped it all (women included) in a way that was very intentional and drove home some incredibly difficult aspects of the modern human condition. They took impossibly stressful expectations that society pushes on both sexes and made them light hearted and surprisingly emotional. As a woman, even though the situations with men in the movie were exaggerated and oversimplified, they were all incredibly reflective of so many of the experiences that I and countless other women have lived through. It was nice to be seen (and to be able to laugh and cry at how on point they were)... I very rarely feel that from a movie, much less from a movie about dolls that I hardly ever chose to play with as a kid. I think the only thing I was hoping for more of was a greater acknowledgment of some less binary identities. In my opinion there were so many opportunities to more than subtlety hint at diversity there. Either way I'm pleasantly surprised at the entertaining way they tackled serious issues, how they incorporated pop culture, and how they both gave homage to the history and aesthetic of Barbie without hiding from some of the dark aspects of Mattel's past."
"I have never seen a Barbie movie. My wife loves them and so I have heard some of the songs, but I have never actually watched one. Having seen some videos and commercials and things, I had a vague sense of what it was about.My wife and I went to go see this movie together, I was there more to support her than out of interest. I expected some silly, fun movie, something like the Lego Movie. I was wrong.The movie initially piqued my interest with its interesting depiction of cartoon behavior in live action. If you've seen the movie, you know what I mean. Interesting, for sure, but not groundbreaking. It slowly progressed and eventually had my full attention. It was something of a spiritual experience for me. The perfect humor drew me in, and the pure emotion portrayed at the end of the movie left me very touched and contemplative. It is an original masterpiece of a movie, sure to make you feel something.To sum it up: I came into the theater with low expectations, and I came out moved and impacted in a way that I have rarely felt."
"Loved it loved it loved it.It's so funny, i was clapping, shrieking, cheering the characters on several times. The movie is just after my own heart, as far as the actual theme and message is concerned. I sympathise wholeheartedly with women's cause and can't thank Greta Gerwig enough for bringing this fresh new take on worldview at least on silver screen.Will Ferrell is awesome here, his unique comedy gels so well with the funny theme that the movie has adopted. Simu Liu, Ryan Gosling were stars here. Loved what greta did with the narrative. It's so cool and unexpected and refreshing and did i mention Funny !?**I was only left wishing Kate McKinnon had a meatier role and more impactful presence. Barbie is awesome. Everyone of them.Would i watch it again? Yes, in a year's time. Great show ⭐ ⭐⭐⭐"
"I loved all the details and give major props to the director. I feel so happy that we have a movie that is so empowering and really well made. Their was a great balence between each scene and captured the childhood vibes I used to feel when I was young playing with barbies/especially adding the over-used barbie with the cut hair and marked face. I loved each character and the message sent is very powerful and I'm glad for it. Really if anyone has anything negitive to say, think first about all the patriarchal movie that exist first, and let us have one slightly feministic movie without starting ww3, thank yew :)"
"The Barbie movie CHANGED my life. It really flipped a switch in my brain that men DO really just want girls ! Nothing more. And you are worth more than that. You ARE all that, and a man's validation does not have to tell you so. Theyre right, barbie is everything and ken is just ken ! Who knew after everything everyone told me i'm worth more than i know, the barbie movie is what did it. I LOVE this movie.Although, i did expect the ending to be a rather more happy one, i dont know why but i imagined an ending where they were dancing just like the start of the movie wouldve been so great (i loved that scene!!!). And since its audience is more likely children, i visioned an alternate ending to the movie as it would've been a little easier for them to comprehend. But as a young adult i completely love the movie, all of the actors did a perfect job as their characters. Last but not least, i did almost manage to shed a tear :') (but i held it in because my mum was there haha)"
"Outstanding cast that tried to save a shortsighted and predictable storyline. Gosling once again shows that he's in a class of his own. Barbie started out fun but shortly into the film, the vibe changes and things take a turn for the worse. The room changes from lighthearted laughter, excitement, and anticipation to a tension one can sense easily. Our fun and bubbly Barbie soon begins to experience those all too cliche, hashed-out stereotypical mantras as she becomes an empowered woman. Sprinkled throughout are moments of goodness especially from Ryan Gosling and the soundtrack is killer as well. Seems like whoever made this movie had issues that they wanted us all to deal with instead of telling us a great story."
"At the beginning of the film, Barbieworld is run by women (Barbies), which reflects the real life Barbie dolls that have all sorts of jobs like doctor, scientist, etc.At the end of the film, the Barbies realise that matriarchy is wrong by getting a taste of their own medicine and so men (Kens) in Barbieworld start being allowed to have jobs and positions of power alongside the women.This is why the Barbie movie is a film about true gender equality. Heavy handed like many popular Hollywood films but great message. Anyone who doesn't believe that Barbie isn't a multifaceted woman hasn't been paying attention for the past few decades. Silly billies."
"I bought into the marketing hype and boy did this movie deliver! It was smart, funny, charismatic, visually pleasing and touching!It was both a perfect social commentary on the world today from a place of empathy and understanding for both men and women. From some haters online I thought it was going to be overly feminist (which I have no problem with) but I think it perfectly expressed how patriarchy is detrimental for men as well as women.But more importantly it was hilarious. Kate McKinnon stole the show, but the acting was solid all around. Really excited to see what Greta Gerwig does next-I heard this movie just surpassed $1Billion-the results speak for themselves."
"It exceeded my expectations. Truly an amazing film. Everything was gorgeous, the actors were perfect for their roles, the music was awesome (i'm just ken is top tier), the plot was super interesting, the outfits were amazing and truly connected with barbies through history, which leads me to say that is also a historical movie that shows the different barbies that existed or/and got cancelled through the decades.It think it's a movie that has a significant impact after watching, is highkey emotional and touch themes that probably a 7 year old will not understand. I recommend this movie mainly for adults because it is related to subjects that we experience everyday mixed with nostalgy (I cried twice during the film) and great sense of humor. But if you are a kid, you can also watch it, even though you will not undestand it a 100%, is visually pleasant!"
"After seeing the movie twice, I think that a solid 8/10 is a fair rating for it. Not going to lie, I was very hyped for this movie for a long time and it did not disappoint. I think all of the bad reviews are really just people who did not understand it LOL the movie is most definitely not anti-men. I don't want to spoil it but, if anything, the ultimate message is very wholesome. The movie is funny and, by far, my favorite parts included the Kens (couldn't get ""I'm Just Ken"" out of my head for days afterwards).With that being said, my main criticism comes from the fact that it is kind of ironic that the movie is basically a 1,5 hr long commercial (to those of you who have seen it, remember Sasha's rant). The message is still good and I enjoyed the movie but, ultimately, it is a commercial. I also really enjoyed the soundtrack but imo the song at the credits just did not fit in and honestly shouldn't have been made."
"BARBIE was the pink surprise everyone needed, it's empowering and humorous. I would watch it ten more times and laugh every time. I would change one direction or another for some characters, but even what I didn't like when seen together with these well-written plots and accurate jokes is almost invisible. It was fun, beautiful and very enjoyable at all times, the cast's performance is electrifying Ryan Gosling is a humorous and talented genius and Margot Robbie she is as nice and beautiful as Barbie should be. The soundtrack is beautiful and as compatible as it needs to be. Someone give an award to the visual and artistic director of this film he deserves it."
"I saw this movie expecting a bit of fun with perhaps some moral messages and a few jokes thrown in for the grown-ups. Perhaps pitched slightly older than the pixar films. What I got was a movie that had me laughing in some spots while other spots had me thinking, ""what on earth am I watching.""I know Barbie better than you're average middle age guy since I've been buying special edition Barbie dolls for years for my (now adult) daughter who collects them. The movie did a great job of showing some of the classic outfits and play sets that would have been recognised by the fans so the nostalgia fuel was definitely there. Cameos from unexpected stars were also a treat.There were some legitimately hilarious moments. Such as the quip about N Sync which gave me a smile - given Ryan Gosling and Justin Timberlake's shared history (they both starred in the Mickey Mouse club show - plus the long running rumours about Gosling almost becoming a member of rival band Backstreet Boys). A huge laugh in the cinema came from Narrator Helen Mirren's quip about casting. The casting itself was great, especially Robbie and Gosling who were both superb in their respective roles.Other than the humourous moments, there were also moments that were uncomfortable or downright depressing. It's not uncommon to have moments like that in comedy movies or kids movies. In this movie though, they out-weighed the lighter moments. The marketing certainly didn't lead me to expect a movie that would leave me feeling depressed afterward. Despite being based on one of the most popular toys of all time, it's definitely not a movie that was made for kids.There has always been controversy around Barbie's awkward relationship with feminism. The movie attempted to address equality by showing a Barbieland where females dominated and males like Ken were treated unfairly. Then contrasting that with the real world where men dominate and women are treated unfairly. It's a legitimate message and I expected it to build up to a conclusion showing that neither should be the case and everyone should be equal. They attempted that, but pretty much glossed over it before rushing on to the ending which was one of the film's biggest ??? Moments. The speeches about patriarchy were valid but were also dragged out repeatedly over the last half of the film in such a heavy handed manner that many would have tuned out from that message. Meanwhile, any attempt at promoting equality was undermined by every single man I remember in the film being portrayed as adorably failing at being macho, or completely stupid. In most cases both. Of course the barbies were barbies but the real world women were portrayed as being regular, intelligent women. Not cartoonish buffoons like all the men were.On balance, I can now understand all the comparisons between this movie an Oppenheimer. The difference is that your average viewer would watch Oppenheimer expecting a lot of it to feel oppressive and depressing."
"As someone who has been a fan of Barbie since I was a little girl, this movie was an incredible journey. The set was beautiful, the cast was great, and the soundtrack amazing. My favourite part though was its commentary on feminism and how the patriarchy effects both women and men negatively. It was achieved in a light hearted and caring way. The original hopes and dreams of Barbie's existence are brought to life, as she is a doll to inspire girls and young women to be whoever they wish. In a world which does not always cater to women's needs, this film does a great job of holding us all accountable. We now live in a post-Barbie movie era, and I'm so excited to see what the future holds."
"Barbie is a film that stands out by defying initial assumptions, proving that it is not just a silly or ironic production. On the contrary, it remarkably addresses important themes with a lightness and clarity that are truly impressive. The storyline delves into subjects such as self-esteem, the value of friendship, and the significance of persevering in the pursuit of one's dreams. Barbie, the main character, emerges as a role model of strength and determination for young viewers, encouraging them to believe in themselves and face challenges with a smile. Furthermore, the film's high-quality animations and captivating soundtrack contribute to a visually and musically gratifying experience. Barbie pleasantly surprises audiences with its positive message, conveyed in an accessible and enjoyable manner."
"No Spoilers:
I went for my daughter and a social 'ladies night' function our local cinema does for certain releases (missed them since COVID).My expectations were of a funny movie about dolls based in a 'barbie world'. Basically Live Action Toy Story Barbie.This movie was so much more than expected. It was thought provoking and gave a reflection of our society that women must endure and made way for conversations between mothers and daughters regarding how the world views women vs how they should see themselves. The idealistic Barbie world vs the real world was eye opening to young girls. The Barbie characters were diverse, intelligent and kind. The cameos, easter eggs and acting was fantastic too.Brilliant movie."
"I'm shocked at how many people have taken umbrage with the policitical messaging in this film. I can sympathise with this only on the basis that the film dialogue is for maturer audiences. Many younger children are going to see the film who I don't think will get as much out of it as the adults, I find that uncomfortable, because I don't think it's been marketed that way.'Barbie' is very funny, fun and a film which is very special visually. The acting is superb. Yes, Barbie is an unapologetically highly political film. That's the point. Many women are tired of feeling 'less than', while struggling with the contradictions of being female. Many of us live with it every second of our lives consciously and unconsciously! To really think about these ideas for the small length of time in this film (which has so much else to offer), is not too much to ask for. It should be of interest to all.The film is not 'anti-male'. We can all learn something here. The film is satire. Barbieland could be considered a heavily satirised alternate version of many Western societies not so long ago, when all the power *was* held by men. Many Western societies are still dealing with the fallout, yes we have come a long way, but not everything has changed. Change happens slowly, it is only fair that in the end this happens slowly in Barbieland as it has in the real world.The final message of Barbie may be simple, it may be cringey, but that does not mean it does not bear repeating. You are enough and as long as you are not harming others, and as long as you do what makes you happy then you will live a fulfilling life, regardless of your gender."
"I saw Barbie yesterday. It was surprisingly good. I think they did as well as they can with the source material. It's a little smarter than you expect they bring attention to a lot of societal issues still all surface level stuff though they were not discussed in a super meaningful way. However it's more than enough given the audience and kids should be learning a little bit about that stuff because it's important. It's full of a lot of emotion and great acting by Margot Robbie and Ryan Goslin. These two were great and probably the best I've ever seen them act. Movie also has a great message and lessons which is a plus these days when all movies are is just special effects, remakes, and franchises. It was enjoyable and entertaining. However it did not feature the song Barbie Girl by Aqua so 0/10."
"It has its great moments like the « Barbie Bizarre » one but it is so jammed with pre-thought ideas that I never really took of. The jokes, the references seem to me pretty « cerebral » except the first one used in the trailer and some of Ryan Gosling ones when as a character he really go for it trying to be the one ! Otherwise, I felt pretty left outside of it as if in some kind of populist political meeting where all the ideas of the moment are expressed. Ok why not, but I came for a story with emotions... and some catharsis. Here I felt there were 4 attempts of making us have a catharsis... but none really worked for me. A cerebral mumble jumble."
"Had another look at the Barbie film. The first impression is undoubtedly a great colourful story of Barbie finding herself in the world. But if you watch it again, more thoughtfully, opening your heart and mind, I'm afraid you will leave the cinema devastated and crushed.I won't retell the plot, but it hides a horrifying reality of the modern world that even the authors didn't have in mind.The film Barbie, was supposed to be an ode to liberal feminism, but I saw a different reality. Barbie's character is not at all central to the story. The film is not about her. The film shows the dismal state of men in a society where everything revolves around vaginas (I'm not saying that, it's from the film). There the film ends with that, literally a vagina. But that's not my point. The authors, without realising it themselves, bring Ken's dramatic story to the forefront. It's Ken who wants to change for the better, not silly Barbie. It's Ken who literally changes his life through his quest to find himself in the world. This is Ken overcoming himself. It's Ken who is talented, resourceful, and driven. And what does Barbie do? She's like a capricious girl who just goes with the flow. She doesn't want change. She's satisfied with the monotonous course of her life: chatting with everyone and partying in the evening.Unfortunately Ken, in love with Barbie, does not fit in with her meaningless existence in any way. Ken ends up building ""his own amusement park, with blackjack and hookers."" Everything was great there, everyone was happy there, everyone was happy, until Barbie came along and through blatant treachery broke it again. Ken very accurately said then that in this world unfortunately there is only Barbie and next to her Ken, there is no just Ken. Just happy Ken. He was trapped in the idiotic world of vaginas. A world where it's proclaimed that all men are fools and women are goddesses reflexive about every fucking thing.Gotta hand it to the makers, Ken's musical episode is the best thing I've ever seen on film lately. Definitely on the list of best films of the year. Disappointingly awesome film."
"This movie is absolutely genius. There are so many reasons why our society needed this movie and all
of it's real life messages. The emotion. The monologues. The acting. The music. Everything was perfect!Barbie addresses the real world in hopes of finding the girl who played with her but ends up embarking on more of a self discovery journey. The real world isn't what she thought it would be, and Barbie world has been taken over by the Kens. With teamwork and unlikely friendship, the Barbies are able to take back Barbieland. The feminism throughout this movie ROCKED. I loved how it didn't necessarily bash men, but it did shine a light on the the massive egotism that tends to overcome men and their logic. As well as their belief to be superior to women. The was the best movie of the entire year. And one do the best movies of the entire decade so far.On behalf all women everywhere, we thank you!!"
"Greta Gerwig continues to prove herself as a leading filmmaker in today's industry. In what is one half of the ""Barbenheimer"" experience, many would be quick to assume that given the subject matter, ""Oppenheimer"" is the superior film that makes you think, while ""Barbie"" is the film where you turn your brain off and enjoy the silliness. And while the movie is undeniably silly, it proves throughout its runtime that it's something more. ""Barbie"" is beautiful, bold, and (somewhat) brilliant.The beauty of ""Barbie"" lies in the sheer talent of its cast. Margot Robbie shines yet again, giving it her all in the titular role. By playing the stereotypical Barbie, she lives in Barbieland and enjoys time with her friends in her dreamhouse and on the beach. But through certain cracks in her perfect world that lead to an existential crisis, Barbie is forced to change and go through her Hero's Journey. Margot Robbie plays this role beautifully, showing the contrast between the Barbie who has a perfect life and the Barbie who learns what life is all about. She may not get any awards or nominations, but Margot Robbie is deserving of recognition once again.This film is bold, and that quality is personified in none other than Ken, played wonderfully by Ryan Gosling. Throughout this story, you get the sense that Ken is just another trivial member of Barbieland, only existing as a secondary accessory to Barbie. When he joins Barbie on her journey, Ken is focused on helping because he wants Barbie to succeed. This changes once the pair enter the human world. Ken learns about the patriarchy, and realizes he wants something more for himself. Ryan Gosling is a true scene stealer, and should get award consideration. Gosling is fun, goofy, and shows off his dancing and singing skills displayed in past films. But when Ken learns of the value of men, he finally feels accepted and important when all he knew was to serve someone else's story. Gosling portrays this magnificently, another reason for Barbie's success.However, while the film brilliantly explores themes of purpose and identity, it falls flat in its delivery of a message regarding feminism and the patriarchy. Throughout the film, Barbie is described as a concept for all girls to look up to. The patriarchy and its negative impact is mentioned ad nauseam, causing some eye-rolling reactions from me. But Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt), who starts off a harsh critic of Barbie, explains the irony in the Barbie doll. Barbie is supposed to be the girl to look up to, but historically the doll is just capitalism and consumerism at its finest. And while it's important to show the power of having women in charge and the dangers of the patriarchy, the message is so blunt and preached to the audience, unlike the other important themes.""Barbie"" is a wonderful viewing experience, with the bright colors, goofiness, and dance numbers you'd expect and the emotional heft that'll stick with you. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are worthy leads, but the rest of the cast deserves recognition for putting their all in the role they were given. The movie is powerful, but there are times when it slips and preaches to us rather than showing us. Overall a great time, and if you truly want to maximize your experience, a ""Barbie"" chaser to the ""Oppenheimer"" feast is perfection."
"Spoilers (sort of)Barbie is something most of us grew up around in some form of fashion whether we played with them with our sisters, stole them when she wasn't looking, or hated them and stuck to our Hot Wheels and Gi Joe's. In this instance, Barbie is not the same Barbie we played with but a woman who is comfortable with complacency and is forced to fight the patriarchy while also find her purpose.From the set, to the costumes, Barbie did a wonderful job of bringing us into the world of Barbieland and reminding us of what the houses and cars used to look like (and how she was just a little too big for everything). Sure there was some dialogue that was aloof and in need of some reworking, and Ken's character was multi faceted ? But nontheless, it had a powerful two fold message to deliver.Barbie is a film that has been so hyped up by the public and it's duality of opening at the same time as Oppenheimer that you can't help but want to see it to stay in the cultural loop. At the same time, Barbie takes what should have been an entirely superficial script and goes just below the surface to remind us of our humanity, the world we built, and our opportunity for self determination. Personally, I think this was a brilliant way to engage moviegoers and a great way to disembark from the surface level franchise films many of us are accustomed to watching. It's comedic and relevant quips and nods entertained while it's double message challenged audiences to think critically about our world and their own places in it.While I am not surprised by the out of place moments (this is a Hollywood movie after all), I was pleasantly taken back by the journey we went on with stereotypical Barbie and her discovery of what it means to have free will. I highly suggest seeing this at least once, and with your mom if you can."
"Great movie. Great casting. Margot Robbie as barbie is just beautiful and Ryan Gosling as ken is just amazing. A fresh movie with humour and sarcasm directly on society. Watch only if you can handle the tone of sarcasm. Ending can be confusing, it depends on your view, I was expecting rather different ending that maybe baribe would go other way but it is subjective. Watch if you want to experience a fresh sarcasm blast on thinking on society. At some point it feels like the points are targeted at only one person but it is not.Beauty of Margot is really amazing. It is truly amazing to watch her as barbie."
"If you want to educate yourself on patriarchy, read Virginia Woolf. The creation or viewing of this movie are horrible ways to raise your awareness about women's rights. It feels like writers were out of ideas an hour into the movie. The movie tries to have some sense of humor but hurts the main idea more than defending it while trying to make jokes about stereotypes of today.The movie features musical type scenes but both the songs and dancing is horrible. People discuss if barbie products inspire girls or force a certain body type to them, so disappointing them but no worries, this movie can inspire nor deceive no one. Even the director lost inspiration half way through."
"This movie LOOKED amazing. The costumes, sets, editing, and choreography were all high-budget and high-quality. That's probably why the poor writing stuck out like a sore thumb.The characters are one-dimensional, the plot was not developed, the themes are poorly executed, and the ending had almost no connection to the rest of the movie. Other people have mentioned the movie's preachiness; instead of developing the message over the course of the movie, the mother character gives multiple speeches to let the audience know exactly what we're supposed to think. What happened to ""show, don't tell""?Robbie and Gosling did what they could with the script that they had, making the movie enjoyable enough. The rest of the ensemble had no standouts, and the other Barbies were frustratingly identical in their one-dimensional performances.Speaking of Gosling, did anyone else feel like Ken had more character depth than Barbie? In the BARBIE movie? Don't get me wrong, I loved his performance, but it definitely felt like he upstaged Robbie's Barbie for a large part of the movie.Overall, it was enjoyable, but I wouldn't waste money on a theater ticket. Watch it when it comes out on streaming and form your own opinion."
"Barbie is the problem with modern Hollywood. I'm not a sexist, but this movie shows how all men are trash. The ending drags so long, just tell ""the message"". There are some gags that landed and the whole theater, packed with girls, laughed, but there were some, where the theatre was quite and i could hear only the fart of the woman sitting next to me. If the main villian Will Farrel, wasn't there, the movie is gonna be a little better, because the villians do nothing and only drag the pace of the movie. Greta Gerwig for the most part, did a pretty good job and the casting is perfect. Ryan Gosling is born for this role and Margot Robbie is great, as i expected. Overall, the movie is not for me. The little girls will deffinely like a lot more, than i did."
"This is quite possibly the most overhyped movie ever. The plot is forgettable and a-lot of the films plot points contradict the overarching themes. Barbie was horrified by the patriarchal society in the real world however when she came back she helped create a matriarchy by appointing all positions of leadership to barbies and refusing to let kens sit on the senate. The ken's were objectified throughout the movie not being given any validation but when they took over barbie threw a tantrum and refused to sympathise with them. Also the barbie's had no objection to the ken's instilling a patriarchy and rolled over immediately conforming to their rules without a second thought. They were meant to be these strong feminist characters but they did not have a mind of their own and it took the monologue of a side character's superficial problems to bring them to their senses. These issues take away from the meaning of the film and overall the idea was executed poorly. The movie has some plus points, being an partially enjoyable comedy but is not worthy of the 8* ratings. An excruciatingly mind numbing movie with some moments of laughter, wait for this one to release on DVD or streaming platforms."
"Very disappointed with this movie. The best part of this movie was the hype prior.The acting was great. The cast were extremely likeable and I thought the visuals were perfect for this type of film. Apart from the slightly good ending and the odd dance, I thought it was pretty average.I believe you can go two different ways with these kinda movies. You can either have a very deep and meaningful plot and some sort of twist to it. Or you can have a very fun watchable movie with an extremely catchy soundtrack. It was pretty much neither.The plot of this movie was very basic. Almost felt like a disney movie at times. With this, I thought it would be saved by making it funny and would have a catchy soundtrack. The comedy was very forced and apart from the odd song, it wasn't very memorable at all.I genuinely wanted to love this movie due to the buildup before. Unfortunately, it was just very average."
"""Barbie,"" the new movie with a mission to encourage and empower women while challenging the notion of Barbie's objectification, falls short of its ambitious goals due to its overwhelmingly negative portrayal of men and the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes. While the film's attempt to address social issues and promote self-confidence among girls is commendable, its approach feels one-sided and counterproductive.On the positive side, ""Barbie"" does boast an impressive musical score that complements the storyline effectively. The movie's soundtrack adds a touch of vibrancy and energy, helping to alleviate some of the weight of its problematic themes. Bilie Eilish's song, ""What was i made for"" sang by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling performance in ""I'm just Ken"" are the standouts.Unfortunately, the film takes a heavy-handed approach in addressing gender issues. Instead of promoting a message of unity and understanding, ""Barbie"" seems to place the blame for all the problems in the world solely on men and the patriarchy. Such a narrative fosters a divisive atmosphere and fails to acknowledge the importance of cooperation between genders to achieve true progress.The portrayal of men in the movie is disappointing and paints them with an unfairly broad brush. By portraying all male characters as either stupid, childish, immature, or disrespectful towards women, the film perpetuates harmful stereotypes, alienating a significant portion of its potential audience, including male viewers and responsible male role models.Additionally, the excessive focus on harassment, groping, and dirty looks that Barbie experiences when she enters the real world feels gratuitous and does not contribute constructively to the movie's message. Instead of presenting a nuanced and realistic exploration of gender dynamics, it leans heavily on extreme examples, potentially distancing audiences from the central themes the film is attempting to address."
"I'm a childfree woman that works in tech (male dominated environments), and I did not like this movie.The first third of the movie was awesome! I loved seeing girls destroying their baby dolls and replacing with Barbie. As a childfree woman I was so excited!The movie could have spent time exploring Barbie Dreamland, or time showing Barbie and Ken reacting to stuff in the real world... instead they:1) Delivered rants about ""the patriarchy"", the movie was preachy and for what? Anyone at the Barbie movie is already open minded enough to go see this movie2) Made it about ""men vs women"" rather than equality. A lot of issues women face due to social expectations affect men too, and feminism isn't about a matriarchy it's about equality3) It wanted to deliver social commentary while being lazy. Even Ken says ""I thought the patriarchy was about horses"" If a movie wants to address social issues using terms as buzz words isn't enough. They could have explored how the patriarchy affects both genders, but this movie imo just wanted to virtue signal4) They got a diverse cast, yet only the white actors had depth5) At the end of the movie Barbie has visions of moms and daughters as the reason it's worth being human. A complete opposite message to the girls destroying their baby dolls at the beginning of the movieI went into Barbie hoping for a ridiculous movie, not a movie about ""how tough it is to be a woman""10/10 to the marketing team, though. They made me think this movie would be fun."
"Starting off exciting and upbeat the movie quickly spirals into endless monologues about the patriarchy.Occassionally there's upbeat dance scenes with Ken(Ryan Gosling) spread throughout the movie.With a strong posse of neo-feminist activists leading the war effort against the dumb Ken's - Kate McKinnon leads well.Michael Cera and Will Ferrell are in their least funny roles ever.Margot Robbie plays well, as well as I expected the movie to be but the movie is mostly negative, I could deal with alot of it in good spirit, but the flogging was extensive and I'm all beat up now. Will never watch this movie again - it's terrible."
"After the sugar rush of the first impressions has subsided, I am left mostly with a memory of excessive preaching. A couple of touching moments make me not regret seeing it, but it is not going to be on my recommendations lists.Lots of fun gags, but they were all over the place and it left main story and main characters arcs bare without enough details to flesh them out.So a couple of monologues that were supposed to be a powerful highlight of the movie, ended up landing a bit flat.Tokenism seemed superficial, and as such once again more of a distraction from the main story.Beautiful moments of Barbie learning to cry that reminded me of the understated magic Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach were able to create in their other works, but it was clearly not the style that matched well with the short attention span of this move."
"""Heavy is the arm that wears its heart on its sleeve."" That's the best way to sum up this overwritten, overlong, stunningly obvious treatise on gender equality, consumerism and existentialism, whose messages get beaten to death beginning early on and never let up, an exhausting experience, to be sure. Writer-director Greta Gerwig's latest offering, co-written with collaborator Noah Baumbach, features a dreadful script that's about as subtle as a young adult novel, drones on and on and on for about 30 minutes longer than it needs to be, becomes endlessly repetitive, and incorporates story threads that could have easily been scaled back or eliminated entirely (such as those with Will Ferrell and Michael Cera). What's more, much of the dialogue is either stupefyingly juvenile or sounds more like ""writing"" than anything anyone would actually say (even for a fictional fantasy character), with attempts at humor that often fall woefully flat. And, to be honest, for all intents and purposes, the project comes across like a two-hour commercial for Mattel (even if the company manages to find ways to poke fun at itself). To its credit, ""Barbie"" does have a few strengths going for it, such as its superb production design, some genuinely clever humor (especially its opening pre-titles sequence and occasional asides), and fine performances by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling (who manage to make this material look better than it actually is), as well as a heartwarming appearance by Rhea Perlman. Beyond that, though, this is handily the most overrated, overhyped release of the summer movie season, one that I'll easily forget before year's end - and one that conclusively proves the power of effective marketing, no matter what the quality of the merchandise being promoted."
"It was sooo boring, I could have left in the middle of the film and not care less about what was happening to the characters. I love the cast but everything was soo unfunny. I left the movie fealing like I learned nothing knew. The movie is trying to be this inclusive thing but with all the jokes directing into the old steriotypes it contradicted its self the hold time. Margot is beyond beautiful and calling her self ugly in the movie even though she is ""The Barbie"" isn't so clevver as they think it is, not even with the narrator. I Love Greta but it dosen't feel like her. Kinda like with Wednesday not feeling like a Tim Burton thing. But good job with the marketing, it got me."
There were no highlights only lowlights but that won't stop you going to see this just to find out if I'm right .It might have a different redaction from women - there's definitely a theme here and it's about the wrongs and rights of the way we've been brought up in the west with the American dream and the role of the sexes and how capitalist consumerism plays into that stereotypeSo it's not without its small number of positives it takes the whole film before aqua finally get a look in with a sample of their sing - the soundtrack is good and kens solo song will ring true with many menIt's not a film for children it's too complex for that but it's for adults to reflect upon the stereotypes in which they've been brought up with - starts with Lizzo and finishes well with Billie IlishGo see it but don't expect too muchBelow averagePad. A 3/10.
"Ambitious mess, its not a polished jewel without flaws.Can see this having true potential and understand people admiring the fearlessness more then the result and giving it a 10.Think you can go watch this if you expect it to be a 5/10 that is flawed and with a good mood you can still enjoy the experience. Go to it expecting a 10 and think your doomed.There is certainly things in this movie to enjoy indeed think it has to many ingredient. The acting of Ken and Barbie are great ironical they get to show off their range by literally barbie/ken.This site really need to lower the minimum review number of words as could have certainly made the same point with half the words, given the option."
"Don't expect ""Barbie"" to come off as the light and airy character that everyone is used to seeing her as. This film is unfortunately much different. Adult situations and humor is sprinkled throughout the film. The acting from the cast was not that great. The word ""patriarchy"" is stated multiple times throughout and the film itself has a very preachy feminist tone to it. Ken and his male friends come off as unitelligent while the female characters appear to almost look down upon them. Most unexpectedly, there is a scene where a line is delivered that mentions ""rampant consumerism"" which almost seemed like a swipe at Mattel, the company behnd the Barbie doll. I'm not quite sure what the writers and director were thinking with a tone like this, but it just doesn't seem right to me. This could have been a fun film for all ages. Instead, it all quickly went down hill fast. In summary, this movie would have been better off going to streaming only as it just isn't worth seeing, especially in theatres."
"Today I went to see this movie and I was so excited. I loved barbie growing up and watched all the movies, this week I played the Dua Lipa Barbie song on repeat and showed up to watch it in my barbie jumper.I loved the start of it, it was fun and colourful. Ken was hilarious and I got the feeling the plot was going to be about Barbie trying to find a purpose like all the other barbies and Ken becoming his own person but I was really wrong.It took a weird twist and turned into this femenist, anti-men, preachy movie that really took all the fun out of it. The movie said Patriarchy more than it said Barbie and completely dumbed men down just to make the women look better. The movie constantly preached about equality but the film ended with the kens pleading for jobs but being refused. Complete waste of potential."
"It is a film of absurd humour (which is funny in many moments) that criticises political models, fragile masculinity and society both past and present.The approach is to turn current society on its head and make Barbieland a world dominated by women, where they form the elite of society and the Kens are simply their boyfriends, irrelevant, unemployed, kept, objects. Basically what women are in the macho society.When Barbie and Ken arrive in the real world, Barbie realises that the world is upside down, that they are the objects and that the world is dominated by men, and Ken discovers the patriarchy and wants to carry it out in Barbieland. So far, the script and the critics are being perfect.After a lot of criticism of the hetero-male behaviour of men when it comes to flirting and leaving them to their basic behaviour, the critical moment arrives, the message of the film. The Barbies fight against patriarchy and supposedly don't want to go back to the previous model where they ruled. I say SUPPOSEDLY, because they do go back to that model. One Ken asks the president of Barbieland if they can be part of the courts and the president's answer is, yes, but from below and little by little.In the end the Barbies, after discovering the reality of the real world, adopt the same model. They do not accept the Kens as equals, NO, let them gradually integrate. Just as it has happened with women, who are gradually being removed from the wage and work discrimination against women. It was the perfect time to talk about equality, to think about a new model, about evolution. And there is no solution, the barbies continue with the model of today's society. So the film doesn't contribute anything, what is the wonderful message, they just show the path of women and turn it around so that in this case it is the man who is discriminated against. If you make a social and political criticism, you have to propose your own solution. In Barbie there is no solution, the solution is the current system.Therefore it is overrated. And on top of not showing the reality of the ""Barbie world"" they show Barbies of all races and sizes, do they sell XXL Barbies? Or Barbies and Ken of all races? They show a diversity that the Barbie universe has never had."
"I'm not sure what the writers and director are trying to say with this film, but I'm certain that it is 100% a vehicle to sell all the iterations of the boys' and girls' dolls and all their accessories.It doesn't paint the manufacturer in a good light, making the CEO (Ferrell, whom I heartily dislike anyway) a buffoon, along with all the men who occupy the boardroom.It makes several well-placed jabs at patriarchy, and the real world, but seems disjointed and searching for a meaningful plot. I swear, this is the last Gerwig movie I will subject myself to, because I find all of her films to date to be confusing and pointless.The two leads (Robbie and Gosling) are perfect, as is the rest of the cast, especially Kate McKinnon as the weird doll. (I refuse to write the names of the manufacturer or the dolls as my own little protest of blatant consumerism and marketing to children.) Just once, I'd like to watch a film directed toward children that doesn't include superheros, blowing up things, violence, or product placement."
"Barbie was a huge surprise in both a positive and negative way. On the upside, I was not expecting as many solid comedy moments and stellar performances by Gosling and Robbie. I was expecting the PG-13 rating to be a bit more for show but it is used to good comedic effect on a number of occasions.The biggest surprise was how effective the marketing team behind this film was. They were not only able to elevate initial hype by tying themselves to a Nolan film, but they were also able to completely disguise what the film was about. Trailers would lead you to believe this will be a fun-loving comedy with some character moments, some heart, and a lot of nostalgia. Instead, Barbie's central theme and main plot revolve around the least nuanced take on feminism I have seen to date. I would not be surprised if this script was made by having a 10 year old girl describe the basics of patriachry to an AI, specify that it should make an over-exaggerated mean spirited narrative from it, and then have some of the most unintelligent writers in hollywood tack on a monologue for the human character at the end. That final monologue by the mother is one of the most insufferable things I have experienced in a movie theater."
"The film started off in the Barbie world with beautiful cinematography and characters which came off as conveying childlike innocence and bombastic ideals. This innocence almost gave the sense of nostalgia for both men and women alike to a time and place that life was more simpler and about fun as a child.As the film progresses, a not so subtle and preachy message of the patriarch is constantly shoved down your throat in ways you cannot ignore it and continue on watching the film.The film attempts to deliver humor in a way that mocks gender and patriarchy norms but severely misses the mark and instead comes off as lacking intellect in its construction and concepts and at times weird attempts at humor such as Barbie telling the construction workers "" I don't have a Vagina and he doesn't have a penis"".The entirety of the film seems to be made in an attempt for teens and young children to be able to come and watch a deeply political and often sexualized film in a dumbed down mannerism for them to absorb its simplicity, but has backfired into a protest like rant down your throat and no room for enjoyment unless you hold similar views to the director.There was great potential for this film if it focused on great storytelling and character development as opposed to pushing the issues and political viewpoints of the director.Overall, a lost opportunity for something great."
"Before I start this review, let me start by saying that I used to be a staunch feminist. I'm certain that once upon a time, this film would have been right up my alley. I would have been nodding along with America Ferrera's infamous 30-min monologue in the second act (was it thirty minutes? It felt like thirty minutes). I would have been cheering when the women finally wrested back power. I would have been disgusted at the instatement of the patriarchy in Barbieland.Now, this sort of narrative tires me, especially when it's so cringy and on the nose. I was expecting true woman power out of this film - a glorification of all that it means to be a woman, especially since Barbie has always been the epitome of femininity. Instead, we have the same repackaged message that being a woman is a torturous, inferior experience, and that you must escape it at all costs. We have the same narrative that men are literal trash and that they will succumb to their basest instincts at first chance.Really, we have the same old, same old: ""Women can do it all"" - we cannot - ""Women don't need men"" - yes, we do - ""Men are asinine, useless, selfish, and egoistic"" - sure, like all women are, if we're making generalizations - ""Loving others by serving them is demeaning"" - serving others is the ultimate form of love and should be uplifted, appreciated, and glorified. Instead, this film shows women in maid costumes to make the point that serving others is h0rribl3!!!11!We were supposed to get a visceral reaction to this image of women as maids - and I did, because it was so artless, cringy, and reductive - and make the connection that the patriarchy enslaves us. What the patriarchy does is simply split labor. Men outside the home, women within. Is that inherently bad? Or does it simply make sense based on men's and women's distinct strengths, at least historically? We must question. You will likely have a different answer than I.I liked some of the messages at the beginning, namely that women are so often subject to impostor syndrome. That was beautiful, but then later on the film takes it upon itself to trample men to ""uplift"" women. I did not feel uplifted. I felt betrayed and pandered to, except I was the wrong crowd. It ignores the hardships of being the dominant sex: Being expected achieve, perform, earn more, lead, provide, protect, wear an emotionless facade. In some respects, women have it easier than men.When America Ferrera, whom I just want say I adore, was doing her monologue on how it sucks to be a woman due to what's expected of us, all I could think was, ""Yes. There are certain expected behaviors of both women and men. It's called basic public decency and decorum.""For instance, men are expected to be dominant and aggressive, but not so aggressive as to be frightening. Men are expected to hide their emotions, but not be emotionless brutes. If we started on this route, we could pick apart just about anything.This sort of monotone, flat representation of our complex human experience works well to get a crowd fired up, but it's ultimately reductivist. I walked away feeling like the director thought I was stupid.What I did like was the aesthetic, the much more subtle commentary on American consumerism, and the representation of teenagers are oversensitive militants. That's it."
"I get it it's a Barbie movie, but as a man in my early 20s going with his fiancé to see this movie, I walked out kind of feeling sick and just preached at the entire movie, don't get me wrong, I knew this was going to be a movie for the girls, but this movie had me feeling like just because I'm ""a man"" I'm abusive, ornery, controlling, etc. And made men out to be awful good for nothing's in every single story and every single male character in the movie, and I don't know about you guys but I believe in equality not reversed sexism.The movie definitely ended with some more heart and ended a little better than I expected it to, but I guess sometimes Hollywood just tries a little too hard."
"As must of recent movies and series, it was a mix of many important subjects and thesis but didn't go through. All were touched superficially (Barbie) and forzed... dont understand how it has such a high rate here... really?The only thing I believe was ejecuten flawless was the movie set, the outfits, and the choreography. Otherwise, I dont thing it concluded any subjects or even really their true point of view. Was just a mix of social ""nowadays must talk"" without any sense or logic or concluded point of view from the characters or writters. Also tryed to be funny and touching, but didnt accomplished... just nonsense..."
"This movie is made for adults, not suitable for children. Despite its marketing campaign that could easily be mistaken for a fun, kid-friendly film, it is riddled throughout with adult language, sexuality, and mature themes. It's a surprisingly unrelenting work of misandry, toxic relationships, and alternative lifestyles coated in the pink plastic shell of a beloved toy. At times it's hard to determine whether the message of the film is more about depression, disappointment, or death as the reality of the human condition. It's a clumsy attempt to paint people groups with a broad brush in order to win sympathy points for the main characters.The production was great, though. The music was stirring and heartfelt, and the visual presentation of the film was unique and enjoyable. The actors also brought movingly authentic performances. And there were some clever comedic moments that brought at least some relief to the suffocatingly heavy-handed onslaught of toxic messaging. It could've been a great movie."
"It seemed like they wanted the barbie movie to be bigger like have this great big message for the audience, bring a whole lotta inspirational stuff but the plot was all over the place cause of all this preaching leading nowhere. Its comedy, tragic, musical, hopeful, inspirational and the list goes on just a mess of a rollercoaster. The preaching is just cringe and too much and when you think about it, it gets hypocritical. They wanted to fit so much into this movie but it didnt flow and work together, they didn't finish the ideas they started. No sort of development to be frank. Only good thing about this movie was Ryan gosling in his role of Ken, he carried the movie and did outstanding other than... dont waste money, energy, time like just dont go at all."
"I had been looking forward to this movie ever since I found out it would exist. I turned my whole world pink. And then I was sitting there in the cinema hall, bored. Yes, I did like the pink Barbie Land. Yes, I loved how they portrayed the actors as innocent Barbie/Ken/(Allan) dolls in their childlike fantasy world. But what happened next? Barbie faced depression, thoughts of death, cellulite, and flat feet (actually, I kind of liked how they freaked out because of that lol). Well, okay, fine - this could still turn out great, couldn't it? Barbie and her ""obviously pain in the neck"" Ken, who appeared more relatable to me than Barbie herself, embarked on a playful and lovely journey to the ""real world."" The CEO of Mattel kind of saved that real-world experience for me. Barbie meets a rebellious teen girl and her mother in a crisis and takes them back to Barbie Land, where Ken, who figured out that men can also rule the world, turned the pink glitter style into a ""Kendom."" So far, so good. What happened next was just annoying and confusing. I'm saying this as a 26-year-old woman. There were endless speeches about how hard it is to be a woman and a mother. And when Barbie decided to live as a human - the already known talk about how cruel human life can be. The only refreshing thing was Ken's battle and the song ""I'm just Ken."" The ever-popular Barbie turned out to be an aging woman who just can't get on with her life and treats the only person who is always by her side (her Ken) like trash, which was the worst for me personally. I felt like no one in the full cinema hall laughed at all during that movie. And the people left the cinema confused and silent."
"It is undeniable that this film has done excellent marketing and the competition has only enhanced it. With a good cast and good direction, the film goes beyond what may appear or be implied.Clearly, if you go to see this movie you already have an idea of what to expect and what not to expect. However, it does not appeal to all audiences: regardless of the film's intended or interpreted approach, it is not for a child audience and goes beyond the Barbie audience; the film strays too far into different ideals, in some cases, somewhat exaggerated and from a somewhat hypocritical point of view, although they end up being relatively solved at the end of the film.Beyond that, the film is comical and entertaining, without becoming boring throughoust, although it is distinctive and ungainly, without being a positive thing in some specific apects.Barbie is made up of a great team that has done a great job to bring the film to the big screen and reach a lot of people, even though the audience that is really targeted and satisfied is very specific; it might not be the kind of movie you were expecting, not only because of its simple, unrealistic and somewhat absurd plot, but because of the path it takes towards the situation of the moment, represented in a way far from reality because of its absurdity and exaggeration in many aspects (this does not discredit the reality of the general idea of the film, but it does discredit the way it is conveyed).Having said that, the film is never boring, although it can be uncomfortable, absurd and, obviously, unrealistic. Within the limits of fiction, the general idea of the film is clear and understandable, although the plot can be improved and there are a couple of good and charismatic characters. If you are clear about what you are going for and keep in mind what I have said without disliking it, the film will not disappoint you."
"This movie was a massive let down. It was never really funny and just kept pushing political issues in my face. I don't care about politics when I'm watching a movie, and I expect a well written story. This film is just bad, and I was actually interested in it. I had high expectations for this film and I think it did not deliver. It's not a valid social commentary because it does not prove there even is a patriarchy and give an example in real life. Actions speak louder than words and this movie is so overrated that I created an account just to leave a bad review. What did I even see in this film? It's a BARBIE MOVIE."
"I'm not gonna pretend that the first bit of the movie didn't make me think of Marklar - the fictional planet that is inhabited by Marklars, who refer to all people, places and things and Marklar. I swear that the energy of Barbie just saying ""Hi Barbie"" or ""Hi Ken"" and specific Barbies or Kens reacting back was pretty much the same. Also, the whole plotline kind of reminded me of Wreck-It Ralph (2012), as the idea that a fictional character must leave his digital/fantasy home has some similar connotations in the storytelling.I can say that I had some fun during the movie. I'm not a big fan of comedies but there were genuine moments where I did have a laugh. At the same time, there were a lot of moments where the nature of the comedy just didn't resonate with me well. To be completely honest, if I had done some research prior to watching this movie and had noticed that Will Ferrell was part of the cast, I probably wouldn't even think about watching the movie (long story short - I just cannot stand his style of comedy) but thankfully, on Barbie he wasn't a major character and his presence wasn't half bad.Now to address the elephant in the room - as a white male, I've never felt comfortable talking about patriarchy, feminism, genderism, etc. I just feel that, as a man, I'm not in a position to understand the struggles of a woman. I can say I can relate to their problems, but I can't step into their shoes to actually feel them. So, during political media courses when we covered gender studies, sexually and similar topics or when we went through the literature of Judith Butler and similar authors, I was just lost and felt completely incompetent. I still feel lost to some extent. Even though this movie was highly satirical, I still felt uncomfortable that various stereotypes, both of male and female quirks, were presented as signs of weaknesses. Both masculinine and feminine traits (which I'd argue don't ""exist"" outside of discourse) create such an atmosphere where neither men or women can live together without one of them submitting to the other. It was more saddening than funny to see it playout. Both the patriarchy taking control and the women taking the power back segments just felt uncomfortable and even the music tracks didn't make it better for me.I mostly went to see the movie out of curiosity as I had hints of there being political underlines and corporative positioning (as in how ideas are sold instead of products, creating a fake sensation of wants and even needs) ideas in a movie that covers the pink Barbie world where life is fantastic. Unfortunately, I felt disappointed in that regard, but the happy vibes did get to me, especially in the first half of the movie, so I can't say my experience with the movie was that bad."
"I wanted to like this movie but it was just plain silly. Maybe it's meant for pre-teens. I can't believe Margo and Ryan needed the money so bad they accepted these roles. Ive also noticed that Goslin puts way too much make up on and a lot of the shots are animated or touched up digitally to make him look younger. He is 43 yrars old. Thiwcis not the type of role for him. Hollywood really needs to step up when it comes to quality. Barbie movie??? I mean, that's just unnecessary. I can't believe some people here thought it was entertaining. Don't waste your hard earned money on this one. Avoid at all costs."
"Salute to the marketing department for creating a buzz like no other, hyping up a film based on what many girls want or dream to be, probably. 1 point for Margot Robbie who is perfect as a barbie-like character, perhaps better becoming the brand ambassador of the brand and stars in all their ads.The film, not sure who's their targeting, children to convey the heavy social issues they are trying to preach, or adults to watch this abomination-children-kind of for, apart from the abs of Ryan Gosling and/or Simu Liu that they keep showing, film. The film tried to be funny, 😑, but the real joke is when somebody think that this is a film worth wasting 2 hours of their life. Ridiculous."
I'm a little lost as to who the target audience is.My guess would be females in their 20's because I doubt any young children will understand the preachy politics of the story.The look of the entire movie was too in-your-face. The songs and dancing were uncomfortably cringe worthy. The whole look and feel to the film was a mix of confusing and annoying at times.The only plus (and the reason I gave it a 3 and not a 1) was Ryans performance which was amusing at almost every turn. Weirdly this is the most versatile acting I've ever seen from him and ironically he was playing a plastic doll.Overall I'd avoid this film at all costs.
"I brought my daughter to this. My eyes are still seeing pink a few hours later! My god how much did the paint budget cost. It's pretty woke thankfully my daughter didn't notice it as much as she is young. Some good gags but woeful bland story. Margo Robbie, is good but couldn't redeem this dumpster fire of a movie. Ryan Gosling also did his best with what he was given.My daughter thought it was ok, she told me that it wasn't as good as the other Barbie movies. She's referring to the animated films.If you have daughters bored on summer holidays it will kill an afternoon but remember you are paying to be preached at."
"I was so excited to see this movie for months, even buying some of the merch and promotional products for it, but it turned out to be such a huge letdown. I was expecting it to be a fun, light-hearted, nostalgic movie similar to how the Super Mario movie was, but I left the theater pretty disappointed with Barbie. It does start off cute, but about halfway through the movie it gets very heavy handed with politics, and becomes a complete battle of the sexes. This lasts all the way until the end of the movie. The political messaging starts to become like beating a dead horse by the time the movie is over. What I thought was going to be a fun, relaxing night at the movies turned into what seemed like a political debate. Such a disappointment! I feel like there was so much potential for this to be such a great, fun movie, it really is a shame how it was turned into a battle of the sexes, women are perfect and can do no wrong while men are complete losers showdown. I am a woman myself, and all that political messaging in the movie was so unnecessary. It would have been completely fine to keep the messaging at how girls can grow up to do whatever career they want and they don't have to look a certain way to be beautiful, etc., but this movie was just too over the top with the messaging of women are perfect, women are better than men, etc. It was just all so unnecessary. I did give it a few points because there were a few funny parts in it, and the set was beautiful, but neither of those things could make up for how disappointing it turned out to be."
"The heart of the director and screenwriters was in the right place in wanting to include current issues and acknowledge how diverse and troubled our society is. However, it lacked cohesion. Today's world is certainly patriarchal, but the film's story was vague and filled with too many topics (poorly developed) and platitudes The role of some of the actors, such as Will Ferrell, seemed meaningless to me. The film covered important themes, but wanted to cover too much and yet covered nothing.The animation, cinematography and effects are wonderful. But the story falls short.I do not recommend it."
"When we saw the trailer for this movie I knew that my wife was going to want to see it. I really wanted this to be a fun movie and figured it would poke fun at itself a bit. Ryan Gossling and Morton Robbie did a great job as actors. But they were not given a cohesive script and story line. This movie was all over the place. It was not fun and it never is when you are watching overlong dialog, songs, and dance routines. I'm not sure I can even explain the main storyline of this movie. Is that Barbie wants to be real? Does she want to help the girl, now woman that used to play with her fix the relationship with her daughter. Was it about Ken not wanting to exist as an accessory? Overall, this was not fun, funny and ended up being tedious and actually boring. This is not a movie for little girls and it is not a movie for adults either. This is a really big missed opportunity."
"This movie is a mess. Story line is horrific ,and the writing is horrendous.it feels like somone put the script in a mixer grinder and made a shake out of it. Im still confused as to what the movie actually wants to potray.theres not a clear intended audience for this . It references so many old movies which makes it way too boring. Even the dialogues are boring . There is not a clear line in the story line. Way too much plugging of outfits.the producer actually spent more time on marketing than they on getting a good storyline.tmost of the jokes were annoying and cheesy.overall the movie is wierd and bogus."
"Rarely have I seen a film that can be so heavy handed with its messaging and at others totally confusing. The script is an utter mess, and I felt sorry for the poor parents that brought kids along to what was very much an adult film. The 'real world' was no more real than Barbieland and can anyone explain the point of Will Ferrells character or why he needed to go to Barbieland.Very few films have I every wanted to end so badly and this one ended so, so badly with the inclusion of the ghost of the Barbie maker just to hammer home a few more points in case you missed them. Just don't believe the hype or the positive reviews, this film is the worst film I've seen since in a long, long time."
"It's like a women's solidarity movie. It was a production in which all men were shown as 2nd class and this was done through a good cast and a well-established company. It's a totally overrated PR movie. Despite all this, the acting was successful. However, the movie did not meet my expectations. Ryan gosling and margot ronbbie are both good actors, but this scenario limited both of their abilities. In my opinion, product placement and advertisements were also over exaggerated. It was like the longest commercial I've ever seen in my life. I can say that I counted the minutes, especially for the last half hour of the movie to end, it was not a movie worth all this expectation."
"So much garbage. I don't get this movie at all. Let me explain myself. This is the kind of movie you live the movie theater why the heck you wasted so much of your time watching this. What kind of audience was this movie made for? Doesn't look like it was made for kids, nor adults. Just a bit more of the work garbage trying to brainwash kids and change the way things are. Who thought this would be a good idea? Same thing happening with big franchises unfortunately. Margo Robbie as Barbie? Some movies like that appeal to our nostalgia, like Mulan, the lion king or scooby doo to name a few. This one failed doing so."
"If it were possible to rate this movie a negative 10 I would. Twenty five minutes in, and I was ready to walk out of the theater. It was without a doubt one of the silliest, most stupid movies I have ever seen in my life. It finally got a little better 30 minutes in, which brought it up to a negative three. Want an extreme waste of the talents of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. How did anyone ever convince them to star in this pink train wreck of a movie? Newsflash to Margo and Ryan, you're only as popular as your last movie! Lots of careers have gone into the toilet after a lousy movie like this one!"
"I should be the target audience. I am a woman in her thirties that grew up playing with Barbie dolls. Malibu barbie, Stacy, Skipper, Ken and the likes.But this movie failed on so many accounts. I cannot for the life of me understand what the message of this movie is/was. What am I take away from this?Kens have more fun? No, wait, Kens have all the fun. They can be as stupid as they want and still get really cool songs to sing? (Matchbox 20 is one of my alltime favourite bands - love me some Rob Thomas) They get to take over in 48 hours, not hard at all, because Barbies actually want to be submissive and they have an actual story arc (although kinda leaning into evil territory). That this movie could have had the title Ken - and Barbies do what... ?Barbies are what? Meant to be pretty and that's it? That is indeed what breaks this Barbie's (camels) neck. The fact that she isn't pretty anymore. And then we get this superficial ""women are so torn"" monolog in the middle of the movie that missed all the beats it was meant to hit. I am a woman. Was I meant to sympathise? It was a meaningless chain of words strung together to form more meaninglessness. Couldn't have perfect Barbie pulled herself up by her bootstraps? No, she needs the mom? With her superficial observations?The Barbie I grew up with was humble. She wouldn't have had this attitude of I know I am perfect, although she of course was. I was missing that too.But most of all, and I cannot emphasise how important that is: I hate that Barbie doesn't get to have any fun in this movie. I hate that she doesn't tell Ken in the end that she can't be the one responsible for his happiness. That he has to take responsibility for his own happiness. I hate that Ken is concerned with not having genitals in front of those real world workers. It shouldn't matter to him at this point in the movie (later on, okay), but even a genital-less Ken seems to be afraid of others thinking he has nothing in his pants.This is a minor quibble. But the ladies in the beginning that I want to call sturdier than any Barbie I've ever seen body wise... Were there ever such Barbies? I get that the movie wants to be inclusive, but I never got to play with overweight Barbie and I would have liked an explanation for their existence in Barbieland. Just one line would have sufficed.There's so much about this movie that doesn't sit well with me, but most of all - even on boring days my Barbies had way more fun than this stereotypical Barbie. She was having real adventures and that is something sorely missing from this movie. Which means I as the viewer had no real fun watching it. Instead I was trying to wrap my head around how nonesensical most of it felt to me.Like my header says - squandered potential."
"Wow....I have never written a review before but felt compelled to because this was just so terrible.I went into this movie only expecting to have fun visuals and a fun story but honestly got neither. I don't even have words for how god awful this was. I'm honestly embarrassed to have even spent the money and bought into the hype.Sincerely this is nothing to be excited about. If you must see it. Wait until it streams or look at the few cool scenes in the bio.Again, I wasn't expecting this to be some spectacular work of cinema....but to be this bored and to roll my eyes this many times?? Definitely was not expecting that either. Feel like I waisted two hours of my life."
"It's a shame because I love Little Women and Lady Bird. Barbie did not serve.It's a long ramble about how matriarchy is perfect and patriarchy is stupid. I'm agreeing with the latter, but the execution is just awful. The CEO and corporate people of Mattel started as a mock to men having all the top positions of a company, as the movie goes they're just there at the back of your mind and it's unpleasant experience because they did not do anything after. So many unnecessary scenes that could've been meaningful. For example, what's the scene Allan fighting other Kens for? There are so many seeds planted at once but none of them grew into their fullest potential. Here are some examples:1. The mother and daughter relationship: It started well, the daughter is disconnected with her mother. You thought the movie will revolve about fixing that problem? No. The daughter has no problem. She's just a teenager.2. Mother's longing for her daughter: The reason why barbie became curious about death is because the mother is playing with her barbie *differently*. She's drawing *weird* (sigh) Barbies. You thought it was because she had a rough childhood and now is the time to heal her inner child? No, she misses her time playing with her daughter. While it is an alright backstory, I see no reason how it is related to Barbie getting curious on death.3. Patriarchy: It's always shown that patriarchy is for stupid men and their horses. The corporate people who are all men tries to catch Barbie so they can send her back to Barbieland. But barbie went to Barbieland and they STILL FOLLOWED HER. It took them too long to get there for no apparent reason. And when they get there it just gets very confusing. Why are they in there?4. Barbie wanting to be human: This should've been the theme of the movie. The point of the movie should've been about what Barbie saw to make her realize she wants to be human. But no, it was only a few minutes when she's seeing people laughing and some people are sad. After that, there was no more of it. They tried to push this in the ending but it just doesn't feel right because of the lack of motivation. Although it was expected. They wasted the whole time with cameos and other meaningless scenes.I am disappointed in this movie. It's not worth the hype."
"First off, I will look at the positive aspects. Margot played a beautiful Barbie. Not only was she pretty, her acting skills shined. However, I felt that the message conveyed here was poor, inappropriate, or unnecessary. I left the theater not feeling great about myself or the world. I did not enjoy how they had to put Ken down to make Barbie better, perhaps that is not what we should do, perhaps we should make everyone better.There were several clever references to pop culture that I thought were good. But perhaps they should have pop culture references that people seeing Barbie would like."
"Spoilers Ahead - Firstly Ryan Gosling was the only good thing about this film. The stupid thing is when Barbie went to the real world she hated how there were a lot of males in leadership positions, even though in Barbie Land it is entirely run by females and then wonders why Ken wanted to change things in Barbie land when she felt the same way as ken in the real world. This lead to ken being the villain and no it was not Will Ferrel character as the bad guy as he wanted to keep barbie land the way it was not to have ken take over so it was in fact ken to believed to be the bad guy. Then the really stupid thing comes at the end when she fights hard to change her home back into barbie land then decides to go and live in the real world which she hated because of the male dominance. Also the whole female don't have power thing is getting a bit old as these days there are strong powerful woman in successful leadership jobs."
"I knew Barbie would be lame movie, but I didn't exepct to be sooooo lame!!!! I went to see it just for the sake that this is the first movie of a kind and I thought there will be some valuable content somehow, but this was such a waste of time. Dont waste your time and money to see this move, its not worth it! Such a dissapointment from Margot Robi and Ryan Gosling to star in something this stupid and shlallow. They could've make something better with the story and the acting, this was amateur level completely. The scenery in Barbieland was nive though, I beleive every girl will see something she owned when she was little. Not recommended!!!"
"This was really bad and boring. Very pandering and toxic feminine and it should have been about equality. Barbie is just not what I expected it to be. I would like if it was better and that people would save their money. Not worth it trust me, I cannot recommend.While the sets were decent, I was hoping it would end and be over soon and then I looked at my watch there was still an entire hour left.I thought about leaving and sneaking into Oppenheimer instead but alas I was with my family and they would have noticed. Just absolutely boring for both kids and adults, it should have been more about the fun Barbie Land and not so dramatic.Overall, cringe as hell and just boring while missing the mark. Men and women are equal and that is that.Good night."
"The marketing for this movie was incredible, so are actors and the whole setting. Not only does that attract a massive audience, but also seeing the famous doll many grew up with. Unfortunately, once I got into my theather seat the hype begin to wear drown. I can not wrap my mind around all the positive reviews on the script and Greta because the plot of this movie is full of major gaps and unreached points. It dives into politics but can not decide what to do with it so instead runs a couple of pointless monolouges that bring no value or add to the conclusion of the movie whatsoever. Not to mention I found myself consistently unsure of what is happening and why. This movie presents itself as a comedy and the audience was dead quiet throught the whole thing! Kudos to Ryan Gosling whose acting skills might be the highlight of this whole experience even when Ken as a charachter made little to no sense. All this amazing cast and promotion might have been too big of a bite for the directors. It felt like they exploited that in all possible ways in order to cover up a weak plot."
"This movie is so cringe, the actors are there just to get the paycheck, no acting performance. I'm giving it 5 stars just for the plot and the editorial cuts and how it did bring joy to my little daughter.I have nothing against Barbie movie creators, though the casting crew shall choose some passionate actors. Margot and Ryan did bring some light to the movie by their performances, they nailed their roles, though it's not that good for the others.Overall it was a fun movie, did had some good jokes here and there, and my daughter now is really invested in Barbie as she wanted her own BarbieLand."
"Those three stars are for the visuals and production design. The movie is just unbearable and exhausting. It's a very undermining and a pointless movie. Thank God the runtime is short. I'm still trying to figure out who actually are the target audience for this. It's neither for kids nor for teens nor for women nor for men. I don't understand the point for making this movie. It begins very well, but tumbles down from there. Real-world seems more cartoonish than the Barbie world. That could be the real reason for Barbie to come out of Barbie-world and turn into a human. Relatability to any character is zero.What waste of two hours of my day!"
Even though gosling gives ken such of a good play. This movie was to peachy. Really not good in my opinion but it was a good movie to sleep to. And my five year old daughter was so happy to see the movie and she loved the popcorn. And the ending was amazing to be a bad movie. I'd say the movie is good in the beginning but it's still badly written and the plot isn't good enough to make a movie like this one or something else that I think is better in that regard and it's not that good at the same level of story but it still makes it a great film to see and see and it is worth a watch and I don't know if.
"I think a film has value if it entertains and/or educates.Barbie entertains with its bright and colorful sets,and its very humorous tongue-in-cheek jibes at patriachy and consumerism.It educates by colorfully and humorously depicting the dangers and folly of stereotyping and consumerist attitudes.To me, the above gives the film only mediocre value to the viewer because they are not accompanied by a strong plot.In other words, society is filled with many and various alternative films with exciting plots and the educational messaging, so why would a viewer bother with this plot-deficient film?Yes, Iknow the film's box office is huge (viewers did bother to see it), which prompts me to think that its reported $150m marketing spend was very effective. Thats what I call consumerism++.Special mention to Ryan Gosling - he's a natural in this film; he played the part very well."
"I literary searching for the answer for 2 hours movie long, I got nothing.I don't get what's the point of view to watch this, a history of barbie? History of Mattel? Why barbie land going like that repeat each day? Why Ken exist? Why barbie land connecting to real world?The character developing is so confusing as well, what's the board of directors want by chasing to the barbie land? Sasha is rejecting barbie, then wants to help barbie at the end? Mother likes barbie and make some Nostalgia, but then rejecting barbie? Ken likes barbie, then wants to learn for patriarch, then revolting barbie land?What is really going on in the writer's head?"
"I went in the cinema optimistic as the trailer looks really good, comedy, entertaining. But the trailer shows the only good scenes throughout the whole film, the rest I never had a bloody clue what was happening half the time, The film didn't make any sense what so ever, besides from the first 30 minutes & the dance scene which was very well performed the rest was a catastrophe.I have to praise Margot Robbie for her performance, despite the deplorable storyline, her acting was outstanding. On the other hand Ryan Gosling's acting/performance was cheap, cheesy, & overall cringeworthy. A massive shout out to Kate McKinnon her scenes were the hilariously funny, I love her originality.Overall not for me, as the storyline is atrociously written & didn't make sense."
"I liked the inital idea where they aproach sexism thru barbie, the oldes concept of feminism that actually took a opposite turn. But, the point was neither here nor there, and I felt like it changed as the movie continued. The ending was whole another story and not well put together with the rest of the plot. I found the characters too romantic, poetic and naive. The parts that I did like was ryan goslings acting, some parts of his character were pretty funny. Also, the musical numbers were great and I liked the costumes and props. Also, the idea of life in barbieland is kind of funny and amusing."
"I loved Barbie as a child, so when my teenage daughter wanted to go see it at the premiere, I was on!The movie started out great, and I really enjoyed the first part with all the funny details, and I loved that they made sure to also include a lot of the most hilarious discontinued Barbie products.The silly and perfect take on barbieland with the amazing actress Margot Robbie playing ""stereotypical barbie"" was hitting ALL the right notes, and I couldn't wait till she was introduced to the hard reality of the ""real world"".Sadly this is where the innovative and creative vibe ends, as the ""real world"" is just as (if not even more) silly and unrealistic than Barbieland - presenting an extreme reality where unintelligent powerhungry men completely run the world and not one single women is able the have any job of significance.Making the entire thing even worse, atleast the last 45 mins of the movie is the morale of.. well.. everything..To be honest ive never been a big fan of Ryan Gosling, and sadly his role as ""Ken"" didn't help. It wasn't really funny, just sad, and the big moment when the barbies was fighting back wasn't really him realising he was wrong, just that him and the other ""Kens"" couldn't really do anything about the fact that the women had taken over barbieland, and they just gave up?All in all ""Barbie"" was a great idea, with a great cast, and it's obvious that they had done their homework when it came to the history of barbie. Sadly it ended up as quite a mess, as the story didn't make any sense - leaving me with a lot of questions."
"The bright colours will appeal to youngsters, and thankfully the mindless feminism will sail over their heads, the feminism sticks with young adults but the nostalgia wont appeal, and for oldies the nostalgia is fun but the poor script and acting is appalling. I think Mattel have highlighted in a 2 hour film why their toy is now completely obsolete no matter how hard they try to rebrand it. If you like comedy watch the trailer, its not just a highlights reel, it is the enitrely of anything amsuing in the whole film. The cast made the best of a bad script, but the writers have missed an opportunity to make a classic comedy for the ages."
"If it matters for an age perspective, I'm 32. I really wanted to like this movie, but it was disappointing. The actors did a good job with what they were given, and the Barbieland costumes and set design were great. But it was a poor storyline. Being a comedy, there were only about 3 moments that I found funny. I noticed the audience in the theater didn't laugh much either. I think the advertising for this was better than the actual film. The media really hyped this movie up and of course currently all the major headlines are rave reviews. But it's definitely not worth the hype. I know I won't ever watch this movie again."
"Greta Gerwig's Barbie is a very interesting watch for a person like me. I'm the type of guy this movie makes fun of in it's two-hour runtime (I enjoy Zack Snyder's Justice League and The Godfather), and it certainly was a weird experience. So, yes, Barbie obviously isn't for me, but I'm going to do my best to give my actual complaints about the film without making it sound like I'm butthurt about its jokes about the patriarchy.First of all: it gets far too preachy. Gerwig could've kept the message of feminism in Barbie, but she could've made it so much subtler than it is. There are constant speeches about feminism and patriarchy. I mean, it gets crammed down your throat about every fifteen minutes. The worst one was when a tween (yes, a literal twelve year old) started preaching to Barbie about consumerism, fascism, and capitalism like she was Jaden Smith talking about the political and economic state of the world. It was insane and laughable.Second of all: the messaging was really messed up and concerning. The end of the movie felt like it was setting up for an actually sweet and heartwarming ending about equality, but it was ruined when the Barbies refused to give the Kens any equality. What the heck was the movie even for then? The Barbies went through literally no character development while the Kens were actually funny and had the only development in the film. Also, the way the Barbies regained power in Barbie Land was baffling. No joke, they ended up making it look like they were cheating on their Ken boyfriends to make the Kens jealous of each other so they would fight. There were absolutely no reprocussions the Barbies had to face for doing this. It was insane. The movie basically taught little girls they should manipulate guys and make them jealous of each other to get what they want.Third of all: Will Ferrell is wasted. He is a big part of the first half of the movie but just kinda disappears in the second half. It's almost like Gerwig forgot about his character but then said ""oh yeah, it's Will Ferrell, we should probably give him a quick scene at the end.""The only part I really enjoyed in this film was Ryan Gosling and all the other Kens. He is an absolute scene stealer. No one clapped when the movie ended, but people (including me) clapped when Gosling finished his ""Just Ken"" song. It was hilarious. You can tell he was really having fun with it. But all the other actors are just meh. Margot Robbie looks like Barbie, yes, but she doesn't really do anything else to stand out.Overall, Barbie is just wasted potential. What a shame."
"The most political movie I have ever watched. It is so confusing that you can't be sure what its target audience is. It looks like they wanted it to be profound, but putting too much 'woke' content made it boring and cringe. As a woman, I honestly felt quite uncomfortable seeing how all the men in the movie were portrayed as stupid and shallow human beings.Overall, 4/10 for good acting, good music, and good costumes.I went to watch this movie as I heard it is not just an easy going entertaining one like everybody was expecting but touching and deep. I was curious. And I walked out of the cinema hall wishing that this movie was that simple as expected."
"The first part of the movie and all the other scenes set in Barbie-land were a huge sensory overload for me. Everything is violently colorful, things happen super fast and everyone is screaming in a strange voice while trying to outscream each other. This Barbie-land is supposed to be a super joyful place but honestly it just made me nauseous. At this point I was praying for it to be over and had a really hard time following what's going on.It gets better when they arrive in the real word, but I seriously don't get why people call it ""deep"" and ""philosophical"" because most of the dialouge is cliché at best and at times it's absolute cringe. It tries real hard to deal with serious topics but keeps explaining things like you're a 5-year-old.Emotions are also portrayed a super weird way in this movie (I guess because we're dealing with dolls, but still, sometimes this level of over-acting just hurts to watch), and a lot of things happen randomly without any explanation. It's also not for (small) kids. There were a lot of really small kids in the cinema when I went and most of them were super confused with some even crying, it was clear they couldn't really follow the plot and didn't get most of the supposed jokes."
"I had my reservations going in due to the fact that this was directed by ""mumblecore"" maestro Gerwig, who was last seen modernising little women to ensure a more feminist ending, but the trailers gave the impression of a fun dish out of water, Elf Meeta enchanted vibe.Instead we got an extended diatribe against men for two hours, albeit amidst some funny scenes and lovely set design. Watching empowered, millionaire actors, writers and directors scream about their oppression by all men is not entertaining, and I found it sad later to see all the excited little.girls waiting to see the next show, to know that they are going to spend the afternoon essentially being told of the evils of their Dads, sitting next to them in the screen!"
"Barbie starts off with a promising blend of satire and clever dialogue, but as the story transitions into the real world, the film becomes tiresome and less captivating. Like oil and water, it attempts to provide entertainment but is hindered by heavy-handed messages. It is not your typical children's film; instead, it feels more like a production geared towards teenagers, laden with political propaganda and mockery of traditional values.The film seems intent on conveying a manifesto against a cruel and unrealistic reality while addressing the existential crisis faced by women. However, for male viewers like myself, the film feels peculiar and confusing due to its irrelevant and comical political undertones.It also appears to take on the role of a feminist campaign, attempting to portray women as equal to men through ironic and puzzling means. Unfortunately, some of the intended messages get lost in translation and lack proper delivery. The perplexing ending, where Barbie's creator claims she can choose her destiny, as if referring to a tragedy as a gift, only adds to the overall confusion and lack of clarity regarding Barbie's origins.Perhaps with the addition of more appropriate dialogue, this plastic doll movie could have been an enjoyable watch, instead of morphing into a misguided attempt to indoctrinate children with politics."
"For me this is the most pointless movie I've ever watched. I really don't understand where all this hype came from. My expectations were not that high considering the type of movie, but sill I waa not prepared for this -> which is the reason why I leave my first review in IMDB.For me this movie is just milking the Barbie brand. Great cast though! The sets, the costumes, the colours - these was perfect. And the actors play so well that you actually cringe while watching :)So, should you watch it?Haha no. Don't waste your time and money, spend some time with your friends instead and buy them a drink :)"
"I adored Ryan Gosling as Ken, and Margot Robbie was perfect as Barbie. (Parents, this is not a movie for little kids.) The beginning was hopeful and I loved the cast and the amazing set of Barbie Land. Barbie's playhouse was amazing! But as it went on, it became way too political and preachy and went downhill. If I did this movie, I would have made it a love story between Ken and Barbie and had them get married, making use of all the cool Barbie toys and her friends. But of course that would have been strangely politically incorrect, even though that's what most people still do these days. So it was a way cool set, amazing cast, but way too political for my taste."
"Really good soundtracks and amazing cast, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were incredible. The jokes were funny too. I also liked the little details in the movie, like Barbie's iconic clothes, or the matrix reference back with weird barbie. But the story and overall everything wasn't as exceptionally good and enjoyable as everybody promises, especially if we compare it to the quantity of hype and advertising it got. Also, I wasn't, and I'm still not sure what audiences it is for. Sure, they say ""It's for everybody"", but no, I don't think it's for everybody. Shortly, worth to watch, but definitely not a Godfather."
"I wanted to see this movie since the set pictures got leaked. Once they released the trailer and the clips, it was one of the most anticipated movies of the year for me.It started off great. It was hilarious. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were amazing. Then the actual comedy stopped. Jokes fell flat. The ""Barbie world"" they set up then just ignored the toy universe they spent 20 minutes setting up to put forth terrible gags and a preachy message that made no sense. For instance, Barbie could only bend certain ways in the beginning, then she can bend her body like a normal human, then she can't again for one joke, then she can again. It was awful.Normally, Will Ferrell is at least a little bit humorous. Even he was dry. The best part was a fake commercial halfway through it. I've wanted to get up and walk out so bad. I felt like it was also geared towards everyone in the beginning, and then adults in the last 75 minutes. It became too dramatic and preachy.The Lego movie managed to be geared toward the family and still gave a good message in the last few minutes. That should have been the route this took."
"I've never EVER wrote here on a movie. But now I just had to. Im 31 years old. Grew up with Barbie. So I guess im in the target group.Visuals? 10/10.But storyline and depth? 2-3. The feminism is strong throughout the movie but for me personally it gets mean. And the script is also changing too many times. I was happy in the beginning but then they changed what I thought the movie was about .The movie was too long, the girls were mean and superficial, and when I thought Barbie have learned how to treat a man, she just strikes back with selfishness. Too long monologues, bad songs. Disappointed."
"I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting much from Barbie, but this was bad. An awful plot with some very unnecessary sequences, and it feels far too preachy to be an enjoyable movie. There is a good movie in there somewhere, but it is buried underneath unnecessary characters and preachy dialogue. I personally would not recommend watching this in theaters, if I hadn't been watching it with my friends (so that we could joke about how bad it was) I would have felt that I had wasted 2 hours of my life. Of course, maybe this movie just isn't my cup of tea. Other than the poor plot, I thought that the acting was done reasonably well, about what you would expect with the cast of the movie, and there were a few funny moments sprinkled in there as well."
"This movie has fun aesthetics, and fun costumes, and sometimes funny moments, definitely great actors, but the whole ideological feminist spin Greta Gerwig did in the plot ruins the entire thing, honestly, and turns a movie that could have been super fun into a bland and boring one. I thought the whole point in society is for us to be equal, not to condemn either gender or portay either gender as ruling society, like why does the male gender not own houses, why are they portayed as disposable and not taken into account, and it the end, they still don't get houses? Also this is a misrepresentation of the real world, as a woman with a career and decent income, I can tell you I in fact have more privilege than some of my male colleagues. Instead of portaying equality, the movie ends on a note where the male species is dumb and still not on equal footing. Disappointing."
"Why destroyed? Cause there was nothing to defend that lovely doll. If you ever watched Toy Story and if you understood what Woody felt after being discarded... It is all in the Barbie movie. Second issue is about the Creator (ghost of Ruth Handler). Barbie meets her in the kitchen I felt like she Barb is a Neo from Matrix...too many similarities. Finally the Geppetto (Ruth) will grand Barbie's wish. No and no! Barbie in the movie is a narcisst who ruled cause she was aromantic. She is like a child in an adult body. Sugar daddys are looking for that kind of persons. Matriarchy without a c..t not a hard job apparently. They show how to use men for women advantages only. Finally thx to ""Geppetto"" she the Barbie got a c..t for herself so she moved out from Barbieland. It is really all wrong. Barbie is not supposed to be Paris Hilton biography. Barbie is a doll and not deserve a movie. Barbie is a mannequin and a business. You can not make a good movie about a Barbie when you use a Pinocchio idea. Barbie aspired to be a real woman. I saw it already in Pinocchio. Except he wanted to be a real boy."
"I did have a very high expectation for this movie but.. Sorry it was the worst movie I've ever watched. I tried to find the message from this movie but I couldn't. It seems like it tried to send a message move our hearts but it wasn't delivered to audiences. Because I have no idea what exactly they wanted to make. So what did they really want to make? Musical film? Comedy? Touching stories? Girls can do anything? Or just colorful cute movies? They mixed it all and added it all so the movie became just lame and cloudy..
I hoped the movie just could be more kitschy, tacky, easy, unrealistically happy and funny like 90s, 2000s movies.I just felt sorry for Ryan Gosling and other actors and actresses."
"The comedy was ok at times. Otherwise, this movie has a modern political agenda, and this is probably one of the reasons why it is highly rated. I understand the need for awareness of women's rights, possibilities, and freedom. It's here even in the 21st century, especially in some countries. However, I'm not sure if movies like this could succeed in giving the good message, or make it even worse, as sometimes the movie is disgustingly misandrous. Not to say that the overall experience of the content was not like a movie, but more of a parody of a movie. I love Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, but this piece is definitely overrated."
"I was really looking forward to watching this movie. Great cast, great global hype, and the feeling that it wants to go further than just a ""girly"" Barbie movie.As a matter of fact, I was quite disappointed. While the message that is carried in this film is really important, I think that it was just to easy. It only talked about things we already knew, and not in a subtile or in a new way. I think it could have been so much more interesting and impactful. The scenario is also easy, you already know how it is going to end in the first 15 minutes. No surprises.Nevertheless, I must mention the great cast, costumes, sets and music. But in the end, it's just a colorful feel-good movie, that is empty inside. Mid. 5/10."
"This movie was awful and definitely not kid friendly. It turned a beautiful childhood toy and turned it into a horrid mess. It wasnt funny or entertaining. Any hope for entertainment was lost immediately. Any innocence that was held by barbie was quickly abandoned by the creators. The fact that mattel allowed for such sexual references and cursing is truly beyond me. Yes this is supposed to be barbie going to the real world and figuring out how life actually is, however it could have been done in a way where what she stands for was gracefully held intact. Instead of letting barbie go into the real world and face independence as she stands for instead of gross references to genitalia would be a start for a better movie."
"Me and my wifey watched it at VIP cinema seats, 0 expectations - sadly both got dissapointed - movie way too over hyped, 0 depth, it's alright for children , daughters I guess, but we wouldn't be surprised if most of the adults and teenagers would be dissapointed in this movie plot especially.We genuinely believe if the second movie comes out about titled - barbie and Ken in the real world the plot and hopefully the writing would be much more interesting, fun, funny, deeper 🤔
One last thing every problem pointed out in the movie was touched so lightly at times felt like it's Cinderella ish.."
"Barbie is one of the best movies that has come out in recent history. It has great casting, great story, great acting, great music. It is a movie about being a strong female role model and having belief in yourself. Margot robbie is gorgeous, Ryan Gosling is funny and all the side characters do an excellent job at contributing getting very positive messages across.I cried several times and laughed at every joke because it all worked wonderfully. I wish people would make more of these movies as they really make the world a better place. There is not one thing bad about this movie. I wish I could find a way to improve it but it is just perfect."
"Barbie: A Rollercoaster of EmotionsIn the vast cinematic universe, every now and then we stumble upon movies that leave us perplexed. The recent entrant to this league is the film ""Barbie."" Now, while one might naturally expect whimsical magic, tales of transformation, or inspirational stories from a Barbie-themed narrative, this movie takes an entirely different turn.The film starts with a ""wow"" moment, and by that, I mean it does capture attention. Vibrant colors, meticulous animation, and that pristine, Barbie-esque world build an immediate intrigue. It's almost as if you're handed a glossy magazine and can't wait to flip through the pages.Soon enough, laughter echoes, thanks to a series of light-hearted and sometimes slapstick comedic scenes. ""Hahahaha,"" goes the audience, and you find yourself laughing along. The humor is akin to what you'd find in classic cartoons where situations spiral out of control in the most unpredictable manner. But then, unpredictability isn't a constant in this movie, as we soon discover.As the plot progresses, the jokes transition from being genuinely funny to being cringe-worthy. One cannot help but feel that the writers might have been trying a tad bit too hard to maintain the film's comedic momentum. The dialogue, the character interactions, the situations - everything starts to reek of cliches that most of us have outgrown. It's akin to that feeling when someone stretches a joke far beyond its elastic limit - it snaps.""Super cringe"" is an apt descriptor for the midpoint of the movie. It's as though the film decided to try on every trope in the book. At this juncture, I found myself torn between wanting to continue watching out of sheer curiosity or to flee and save myself further second-hand embarrassment. It's the cinematic equivalent of a car crash - you can't help but watch, even if through the gaps in your fingers.The descent into ""ewww"" territory is swift. The choices made by characters, the overdone scenes, and some seemingly unnecessary dramatic moments make one question the very essence of the storyline. Is this still a Barbie movie or a parody of itself?Just when you're on the brink of giving up, the movie surprises with a ""serious speech."" This soliloquy feels out of place, like an oasis in a desert. The emotional weight behind the words and the depth it brings is commendable. It's as if the movie momentarily redeems itself, reminding us of the values and the principles that Barbie, as a brand, has stood for over the years.But before one can dwell on this profound moment, the movie hurries towards ""the end."" The conclusion, or lack thereof, is a testament to the film's erratic narrative journey. It's disjointed, abrupt, and leaves more questions than answers.In summation, ""Barbie"" is predictably unpredictable. From the promising start to the descent into a muddled mess, the movie is an enigma. The storyline's trajectory is confusing, and it's evident that there was a lack of clear direction in what the writer was trying to convey. The film lacks a proper ending and leaves viewers in a lurch, desperately trying to piece together the filmmaker's intent.For ardent Barbie fans, this might be a disappointment. For those looking for something unconventional (albeit chaotically so), it might be worth a watch. One thing is certain, though: this film is bound to spark conversations, be it about its brilliance or its sheer audacity. But as the age-old adage goes - any publicity is good publicity. And ""Barbie"" sure has got everyone talking."
"I had high hopes for this movie. The director of ""Barbie"" is, in my opinion, a pretty high caliber filmmaker. I hoped that she would be able to make the movie both beautiful and funny from the visual point of view, and at the same time be able to give the movie a subtle, deep meaning. And the movie succeeded in the former. It's funny, it's witty, it's beautiful!As for the meaning behind the work, there are already hints in the first half of the movie that Gerwig wanted to and could subtly comment on the social structure of the modern world. That the film would criticize and at the same time reveal all sides of the problem. True, life is an ambiguous thing, there is neither pure good nor absolute evil..... Oh, where am I going with this? This movie is not worth the effort. In the second half, the movie turns into a primitive agitation with a simple idea of ""men are bad, and all women are oppressed, so girl, get up, we'll show them all"".... Okay, actually, if there is a large audience of people who want to hear such thoughts. If there are those who care (and they do) - then such a work has a right to exist. But. The thing is that in the end we have a fanfic praising some people and belittling others, a work for a specific audience. And, on the one hand, it's great, it's wonderful that there's something that brings someone joy. But for me, on the other hand, it is absolutely useless, uninteresting to watch such a movie that ridicules men and belittles them. It's... wrong. I expected to see a smarter, deeper work, a meta-view of all sides of the issue. But apparently, modern audiences won't be able to understand such a product, they need to be shown something simple. Alas."
"Going to the cinema is a waste of money if you just not want only watch Margot. Barbie certainly had the potential for an original and fresh adventure musical, but alas. Unfortunately, even well-chosen actors, well-written songs or an original and fresh visual cannot save a completely tragic scenario.A mess of banal clichés and a completely wasted opportunity. With such a budget, a cast and an interesting iconic toy, it should have been handled better.The film has a very interesting and brisk first half, but from the second it drags on at a disgusting pace.Even worse is the completely inappropriate, overblown and absurd push towards feminism."
Listen as a woman in her 20s I am all for feminist movies but this movie really felt like a disappointment.Went in with the expectation of something only to be disappointed.The plot seems to be non-existent. Barbie has a crisis she goes to fix it but then it all becomes a mess. The dialogue feels like it's preaching rather than embodying the actual characters or the growth feels so non-existentHalf of the movie has me feeling overwhelmed and confused. It wasn't my cup of tea because of how obvious all the quotes felt. The director tried to create depth but there was no depth only this quote that felt so obvious making it even more boring.
"Boring uninteresting movie, it was fun at the beginning but the on going topic about feminism ruined the movie, felt unnecessarily long. Don't really recomend.It's good in the beginning and the experience it's not terrible, don't like the fact it's too long and you end up getting bored. Ken plays a role but it's overly complicated and annoying don't really know how this is rated as a good movie. Most like a 5/10 movie that you shouldn't watch at the cinema.Finally don't enjoy watching it at the big screen, RX and other cinematography was mid and don't look like a worth it movie to watch or invest time and money."
"I get the point but nah man! 7.5!!??Yes women are supposed to be their own identity as men but I mean. Why was the ending so dull. At least I could have appreciated the life after the ""change"" it didn't have to be dull.I have a big problem with classics ending so dull, unless there is a sequel...... If there is, A HUGE IF, at least you could have showed us how her life actually becomes normal.I mean the movie in and of itself is a powerful message but the plot ending leaves a lot to be desired.No spoilers but come-on!!!!!Come onnnnn.And at least you could have made it friendly for Kids!!!Anyway I'm sure I'm one of the few adults who don't really like the whole set."
"I have to express my disappointment with this movie, as it is riddled with an overwhelming number of loopholes and plot holes that hinder the overall viewing experience. It's quite disheartening to find that there is a noticeable absence of a compelling and engaging story, leaving the audience wanting more substance and coherence.Frankly, I cannot help but think that investing time in watching this film is not the best use of one's entertainment hours. Instead, I would suggest diverting attention to purchasing a Barbie doll, allowing for a more enjoyable and imaginative playtime experience.In conclusion, I find it regrettable that this movie fails to live up to expectations, and I consider it to be an utter waste of valuable time and cinematic potential."
"This movie had so much potential!! It was doing so well for a while, it was funny and clever and had depth and I was super excited to see where it was going to go, but then it just became disappointing with a really underwhelming and incoherent (even problematic) conclusion. I'm almost angry at it. Even pure shallow entertainment would have been better than planting all these seeds, making you believe they will grow into something and then just letting them die.Btw it's definitely not for under 12s. There is nothing inappropriate in it, so they could technically watch it for the visual aspect, they just wouldn't understand much.------ SPOILERS ------Some of the elements where the movie deeply disappointed me are below. Please don't read any further if you haven't watched the film yet and want these elements to be a surprise.Ken's development:Ken realises that men aren't treated as equals in Barbieland, and creates his own patriarchy, which in the end the Barbies tear down. When Ken bursts into tears thinking that he will have to go back to a life where he is oppressed - that could have been developed and executed so beautifully! Barbie even told him it's ok to cry. This could have moved towards all Kens understanding that they need to express their vulnerable emotions in order to not be angry and toxic, and the Barbies need to stop the oppression of men because it's just as bad as oppressing anyone, and it could have led to equality in Barbieland! But no. Turns out Ken is in fact crying because he has an unhealthy, anxious attachment to Barbie and his ego can't take the news that Barbie is not 'in love' with him. And then the movie concludes with Ken agreeing to explore who he is individually without Barbie (this would be an ok conclusion if it wasn't for abandoning all the other deeper seeds planted before), with some other Kens getting middle management jobs in the (once again) matriarchal Barbieland society, but not leadership positions, 'the same way it is for women in the real world'. Seriously? It's like this was written by men. The Barbies are going for revenge??Barbie's development:Barbie wants to be human, and again this could have been developed with emotional and intellectual depth, and there is an attempt at the beginning to show the reason Barbie started to have these thoughts, where she is seeing humans express all these complex emotions, and she's seeing the beauty of the world around her in all those small magical details in nature that feel more intense than usual, but then this thread is dropped completely, so much so that in the end when Barbie is asking to be human, it doesn't make sense why, and the narrator has to literally do a voiceover speech to explain it (badly). And then when she is finally human, her first (and very overhyped) trip is to the gynaecologist, implying that what she's most excited about being human is having a vagina. Again, written by men?? This movie is literally setting women back 50 years.Development of the mother - daughter relationship:Not much to say other than how shallow this remains despite setting it up as if it was going to go somewhere. Barbie goes to the real world to find this teenage girl whose emotions are causing her to malfunction (the malfunctioning focused on cellulite which is a whole other horror story!) It then turns out it's actually the girl's mum who is playing with Barbie and feeling these emotions because her life isn't fun and her daughter is hostile with her. And then at some point out of nowhere the mother and daughter start hugging and smiling at each other. That's it. We're not going into why she was hostile in the first place and why she isn't any more (teenagers are not hostile for no reason), we're not touching on why the mum was feeling that way and what made her not feel that way any more (it clearly wasn't just her daughter). But everything is suddenly fine now. Oh ok then.Allan:This is so chaotic, I don't even know where to start. So he has a particularly sensitive / gay / queer vibe, and I think they are trying to make him into a hero (like he fights a bunch of Kens for no apparent reason - they really could have used that scene for something else), but the point of him is unclear. He's an ally to the Barbies, and there's only one of him (which I always think is actually a bit problematic, to have only one token representative of the LGBTQ+ community in a film; although I get that in real life Mattel didn't have that much diversity and they were trying to stay true to that). His motivation siding with the Barbies in the patriarchy seems to be the fact that he feels invisible too, but the movie doesn't go into this at all, and kind of ignores him the same way the characters do. Like he's a hero simply by being different from the Kens and helping the Barbies, but how he feels throughout this, and what he gets out of it in the end, if anything, is anyone's guess. It's not clear whether or how things change for him at all. They don't seem to, despite all the effort.'Weird' Barbie:When Barbies are played with too hard, they turn 'weird' - strange make up and clothes, cut and messed up hair, always in splits. So far, very funny. But why does 'Weird' Barbie remain perceived weird throughout?? Why doesn't anyone realise that she is just as beautiful still as the other Barbies, despite her unusual hair and make-up and non-perfection, or why doesn't anyone realise that she basically saves Barbieland, and it doesn't matter in the slightest what she looks like, she's a hero? Thanks for making all girls who are unusual-looking or not stereotypically beautiful and perfect feel like freaks.Especially because of 'Weird' Barbie and Allan, the movie's 'diversity' just feels so forced.The board of Mattel (all real world men who are painfully stupid):With Will Farrell as CEO. First of all, what was funny 20 years ago is not really funny any more. Will Farrell should only be in this if there is some clear development of the narrative behind his behaviour. But there isn't. It's all a bit of a mess. We get a kick out of the mockery of foolish men at the beginning, but they are still in power regardless of anything. They are trying to put Barbie back in a box but she escapes (another missed opportunity - what would have happened if she goes in the box?), then they chase her into Barbieland for no reason (they wanted her to go back, she goes back, so why don't they just celebrate and stay where they are?), and then there's literally no point of them being there. Was casting Will Farrell just an attempt to get middle aged toxic men into the cinema?The cellulite issue:Barbie agrees to go to the real world so that she doesn't get cellulite. Literally. I do understand sarcasm and I get that this would be quite funny IF we as a society were beyond that already and IF there weren't any teenage girls watching but the film is a 12 and the beauty industry is making more money out of women's insecurities now than ever. If we're going to use sarcasm here, this needs to be addressed later, for example Barbie realising that it's our uniqueness that makes us beautiful (they really missed an opportunity using 'Weird' Barbie to drive that message) and cellulite doesn't matter, but no such thing - the movie concludes with the message that cellulite is indeed a malfunction. This has got to have been written by men.Apparently the only man involved in the screenplay was Noah Baumbach. Ah, co-produced by Mattel. Of course. All the male Mattel executives must have had a say. Now it makes sense. The movie is fun to watch and it's certainly witty, especially in the first half, and I really liked the performances and visuals. There seems to have been strong intention of depth and the movie is very political but ultimately fails to convey the right message and all it ends up being is a clever brand extension to make more money for Mattel."
"I grew up watching Barbie, my kids watched every Barbie movie. This was AWFUL! Extremely dumb, language was uncalled for (mother Bleep, vagina, penis, I'd like to see the blob in his jeans), on top of Mattel being made something it isn't. Where are all the other Barbie characters? Ryan, Raquelle, Summer, or her little sisters? At many points I was either yawning or asking myself why am I continuing to sit through this? I took up for the movie and told people it couldn't be that bad they were just being too judge-mental. Na I was wrong! It's terrible and I can't say that enough. You failed us!!"
"The camp in the movie was creative and fun. That part of the movie was a 10/10. Having a character yell at you for two minutes about how hard being a woman is isn't creative and fun. That part of the movie was a 1/10.But I still did love the movie. I was laughing throughout most of the movie. The sets, the costumes, the small jokes were all so wonderful. The Barbie world feels totally separate and complete. Ryan Gosling was really the star of the movie for me. Every moment he was on screen I loved it. The moments I didn't love, were really hard to get through. I loved the take of Barbieland being a total matriarchy, but I really didn't need to be beaten over the head with a stick for two minutes to get the point they were trying to make."
"At first, I didn't want to go on this film. Then I was drowned to the movie theater by the advertising campaign expecting something. But nothing is actually occurred.I mean really it was as simple as it gets entertainment, not even interesting, sometimes worst to say boring.Thus, I honestly don't understand the universal admiration for this movie. It literally has nothing to offer.I went to the bathroom and I didn't feel like I was losing anything because I had a deep inner feeling that I really had nothing to lose in this film. Furthermore, I think that is the best categorization for this movie.You have nothing to lose if you don't see it."
"The movie did some real weird worldbuilding where none of the rules were consistent. I had to keep reminding myself that barbieland was made by men, therefore barbieland is not an exact opposite of the real world - it's a rendering of what ""men"" think female utopia is. But it wasn't a direct opposite of real world either. I doubt many viewers will actually be able to internalize that as part of the lore.The parallel between realworld and barbieland just didn't make sense therefore it felt like a plot fail. If barbies are all important unlike women in the real world, where does Ken swooning over Barbie land on on that real world spectrum?Im just going to say, the fact that Barbie has 0 complex feelings until the lady from the real world played with her, but Ken was aware of being unhappy WHILE being not a person but an accessory to Barbie is the kind of double crossing i didn't expect. I was confused about which point it tried proving.Ryan Gosling has a real chance to become an icon for incels after this performance. He gets rejected, creates an ultramasculine society, and at the end Barbie apologises to him and he rebrands? He was a villain and did not get a redemption arc. He shouldn't even be sentient in this universe as much as he is. I expected Barbie to be honest with him and say she just doesn't love him, or that she wasn't made to have those feelings to him because Matell did not give her those feelings. Instead she apologises for not giving him more attention?Anyways, it wasn't feminist enough for me. It felt like it avoided some major issues of real life (like the phrase ""we just learned how to hide it better"" that did not get addressed whatsoever). Like, the Barbies now know that women don't have it as great as them in the real world? How does that solve anything?Maybe i am just reading too deep into a movie with flawed worldbuilding, made for people who don't generally see the gender bias around them?4 for some funny jokes, but it could be funnier."
"In a fun, visually stunning, simplistic way, Barbie captures the audience with nostalgia and bright color schemes. With a plethora of Barbie styles, versions, and callouts to real accessories, Barbie proves to peak the interest of the audience and bring humor with short quips and comments by the characters and narrator. It has a strong opening that establishes the make-believe world and sets a quick witted tone to the movie, mixing slap stick comedy with deeper philosophical undertones.However, after establishing main character
Barbie and side-kick Ken characters well, and showing a clear direction in the first quarter of the film, humor is exchanged for harsh reality in the second quarter, with no real relief or solution given to the audience. As the movie moves into the third quarter, mixed messaging seems to have feminist roots, but fails to address real issues for the common, moderate feminist. There are several chances in the film in which the main character, Barbie, can and does acknowledge the imbalance between men and women, but fails to provide a bonding, peaceful solution to the imbalance. Furthermore, it doubles down on the more radical, one sided views of modern feminism, aiming to make one gender (men) incompetent, while promoting the other gender (women) as the best leadership solution for a competently run, balanced society. At one point a main character, other than Barbie, has a minutes long soliloquy outlining all the troubles of women today, yet solutions are never presented and the end result feels more like complaining than empowerment.The last fourth of the movie seems to complete the fall away from the light heartedness of the opening, which was actually one of the strengths (and expectations) of the film. Slap stick, awkward, one liner comedy remains throughout, but while watching, the audience's confusion about the message only allows for chuckles instead of all out laughs. Some comedy ends up falling flat from obvious missed payoffs or opportunities to instill the uniting of genders as a solution. Instead, the film awkwardly seems to support the notion that one sided governance is acceptable as long as it is the side that the writers deem proper. In this case it is clearly women, but almost coldly so, as if leaving out the core feminist movement completely. If Barbie was meant to leave the audience with a feeling of hope for the future, it certainly missed the mark. On-the-nose propaganda was not what the audience came to see, but is what they received, regardless of how humorous any scene attempted to be.The best aspect of the movie are convincing performances by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. Robbie's portrayal of Barbie is well over shadowed, or more accurately, over powered by Gosling's Ken. Unfortunately the character arc for Barbie was completed but underwhelming, while the character arc for Ken was expansive but confusing. Both characters seemed to miss the moral growth mark, leaving the audience wondering if any lessons had been learned at all.In summary, strong visual presence, humor, and performances kept this film from being a total flop due to the over exaggerated and misguided social commentary forced on the viewer. What should have been a light hearted, fun, uniting feel-good film, was indeed a well put together, visually stunning, mildly funny piece of propaganda for Mattel playing dress up in a modern feminist costume that only a Barbie doll could get away with."
"Great costumes and set, but the Barbie land was not fully exposed instead they chose to make every single scene in the movie a political stand. After half an hour is stared to feel like ever other generic Hollywood movies. Everyone in the movie theatre was trying so hard to enjoy the movie, but all there expectations were crushed. No one laughed at the supposedly funny scenes. It was a dread. Dude people go to a Barbie movie to have fun, we have social media to preach about political issues everyday. Everyone fighting for every minute sign of offensive remarks. News anchors and politicians virtue signalling. Where will people go to have fun, Hollywood deserve to go broke."
"While there were definitely some funny parts, they were too few to outweigh the other annoyingly cheesy jokes thrown around. The actors seemed a bit on the older side but the overall movie did not appear to be an ""adult movie"". I feel that it tried to find a balance for kids and adults but in the end fell short for both. Some bits were too long for my taste and the plot seemed to go back and forth too much between the Barbie and the real world. I did not have high expectations but what did help me watch through the movie were the strong messages for our generation that were heartfelt and genuine."
"The movie starts off well with a surprisingly clever and colorful depiction of Barbie's world. She drinks out of empty cups, showers under a waterless shower, can fly around as if transported by a hand just a like a real doll house. At some point, Barbie starts becoming a real woman by thinking about death, having cellulite and her feet flatten out. She goes into the real world to find the girl that broke the spacetime continuum and started to make her real.All this time, we see lots of Barbies (all of them named Barbie) that have advanced degrees, are racially diverse, with different body types even. The Kens are brainless bodybuilders who don't have any occupation other than being pretty and overly infatuated with the Barbies. Ryan Gosling does an excellent job and portrays Ken perfectly which was surprising to me. Definitely an Oscar performance for the actor. Also Margot Robbie is absolutely gorgeous and breathtaking across the whole movie, a true real life Barbie doll who also plays the part perfectly. We also have basically half the cast of Sex Education and lots of references to other movies like: the Matrix, Pinocchio and maybe others which i haven't observed.This being said, the problems start to pile up now cause all of the above is just a superficial sugar coating for the real reason of the movie: gender theory propaganda. The world is reduced to the patriarchy. When Barbie and Ken go to the real world, Barbie feels objectified and powerless and Ken starts understanding the patriarchy. While the real world is a true patriarchy the Barbie world is a true matriarchy. Long story short, Ken goes back to the Barbie world, establishes the patriarchy there and then Barbie and ""her owner"" go back to the Barbie world and reestablish the matriarchy. The movie is blunt and frankly disappointing in its portrayal of men and women. Men are nothing. Women are everything. Men, portrayed through Ken, don't have meaning, and are not supposed to have meaning in life, they just exist to be ""beach""-ing and simp over Barbies. Women on the other hand are everything: lawyers, teachers, senators, presidents, PhDs, scientists etc.I dare the audience to think of the Barbie movie in reverse, women are nothing and men are everything. That would be an outrageous movies and the directors would be down right cancelled.The movie does not present the true condition of being a woman today, but it just hates on men and wants them crushed and powerless in a sort of historical revenge. It reduced the world and the complex social dynamics between men and women to patriarchy. The movie it's divisive, destructive and does not solve any problems. I honestly felt like i was in an Orwell novel. It's a pitty, because the set was very good and had a lot of potential for something deep and meaningful, something that could have brought men and women together as a team. But instead it resorted to SJW, woke, extreme left ideology and apparently the audience was brainlessly having it."
"I thought the plot was very out of control and did not have a way to end itself. Most scenes last 1-2 minutes too long and the ending is terrible. No resolve was ever made to the story which leaves. We have this whole movie about how both matriarchy and patriarchy are not perfect or good, but instead of leaning into that the movie ends with everything going back to how they were before. Politics aside, this movie had no clear goal in mind for the plot and it showed in a very convoluted mess. One positive is the set design and costumes were amazing. The actors were okay in this movies and flashes of comedy was shown, but most jokes are over used or just fall flat."
"Massive fan of Margot Robbie but she is so much better than this.....From the get go, this film has no context and just looks like it was rushed together. It certainly has some funny parts but there are few and far between. The film centres to much around a fake world and not enough in the ""real world"". There is also to many rude references which to be honest, weren't necessary. I get it a 12A but surely they knew many of us would be bringing kids along.It was not a fun ride and will be one film that I will be forgetting about quite quickly. Potential was there but the storyline wasn't. Disappointed!"
"This movie did a lot of things good and a lot of things bad.It left me from the theater feeling more emotions than Oppenheimer. Those emotions being anger and frustration.The movie was aesthetically very precise in the way that it felt like they had a specific vision for it. It reminded me a bit of what Toy Story would look like in live action. It leave the audience ponder over the significance of the movie, which I have heard a lot. There were a lot of moments where the film was heading in the right direction but I felt they haven't fully explored those ideas. It felt like a waste potential when Barbie goes into the real world and sees how women are ""supposedly"" treated. This is no new concept and feels a bit exaggerate and not addressing the real challenges women face in society. I feel we have pass ahead of what was being portrayed. The monologue with the mother to the Barbies did feel relatable and wish those concepts were explored a bit more than just being repeated again.When Ken brings back patriarchy to Barbieland and the barbies take it back by manipulating and tricking the Kens felt very cheap. What was the message behind that. At the end of the movie nothing changed. Barbie did become a fascist and took over Barbieland and were back to square one. Maybe that was the message, that nothing will ever change. The Ken are to Barbieland what women are to the real world.Except for stereotypical Barbie having thoughts of death and cellulite (that plotline was then abandoned and never mentioned), all the Barbies were supposedly perfect and didn't have any flaws, which is the point, but if you want to portray realistic women, why did all the barbies at the end became the same as before? There was no progress done. There was only weird Barbie that felt human since it has ""bad"" and ""good"" characteristics but it felt like she was only a tour guide than an actual character.Perhaps that's the message of the movie, that there can be no progress, which this movie was really good at getting conversations started since there are so many mixed opinionsThis whole movie also felt like a whole 2-hours long commercial on Barbie. The whole marketing campaign made it feel like you fell in the trap of what this movie was trying to avoid, capitalism consumerist society, yet the sells for Barbie will increase.The monologue with Barbie and the creator felt forced like those motivational speeches trying to force the message to the audience instead of thinking and coming to that conclusion.There were more than a few awkward moments that didn't need to be in the movie that felt unnecessary.The casting for Barbie was spot on but I would not agree for Ken. It didn't make sense for Ryan Gosling to be Ken, although no complain from the acting obviously, but just didn't fit. The hair looked awkward and distracting and wasn't a portrayal of the youth Ken.At the end, I think it's also a huge generalization and don't know if this is the right movie for feminism and equality. I expected more from this movie."
"This film had so much to yet fell so flat.First off, the humor felt so cheesy and dumb. It didnt fit well together and often (mostly) missed the mark. It started weird, got better then NOPE! Flat. Over and over again.The flow of the plot, also, had so many great things yet was carried out in such a strange flow. Started great then strange, goes great then strange, etc., on and on again.Yet, the thing that truly sucked was the ultra feminism-> It made all men weak and stupid, and that is just wrong. Women are strong and powerful, but men do not need to be so degraded to see it. Women shine on our own. Masculinity is great, and WOMEN are great. Together they are wonderful. Woman are strong, and men aren't the problem. Hate and being a jerk is the problem.But, the good- the relationship between Barbie and Gloria! It was so sweet. Still ultra feminist but so so sweet.AND WEIRD BARBIE is awesome. She's so weird and every girl ever loved their weird Barbie. I sure did."
"This movie is not for kids despite the trailers I saw not showing it may not be for kids. I only saw 1 or two trailers for this movie, and it just looked like a fun movie about barbie in Barbieland and she for some reason goes into the real world. The sub plot of needing to help the girl that is playing with here is just that sub plot the main plot ends up being patriarchy and matriarchy. The sub plot should have been the main plot. The set design was great, the world looked beautiful, the story just sucked. Not all men are pigs or stupid in the real world and I thought they leaned way to hard into this. If they were going to go with this main plot of who is the top dog it should have ended with mainly barbies and 1 ken on council at the very least. I grew up playing with Barbies and I am sorry, but my Barbies always loved their kens. For Barbie to basically hate her ken was just a slap in the face in my opinion. There was not enough Barbieland and too much stupidity."
"Whenever someone says they disliked the movie most people tell them it's because they are not getting the plot correctly or they simply don't get feminism. I am a girl and a feminist and this movie was all marketing, ik i'm not saying something new. It was a cute story but half of the dialogues were bad/kinda cringy. Also, many relationships were presented to us, for example the mom and her daughter, and the movie never bothered to show us a little backstory, it had potential. At least I really appreciated that the main purpose of the movie was to show women everyday struggles, loved the monologue.I think it's a nice movie, but not worth the hype like to watch it in the cinema."
"I had high expectations based off the trailer and had purchased quite a lot of merchandise in the lead up to the films release, however for me that's as good as it got, brilliant marketing. The first 20 minutes were funny and entertaining but that swiftly turns sour and boring, leading onto an hour and a half of speeches and overly serious moments that just weren't that touching. I can see what they were trying to do with #girlpower but I found it a little toxic and very much like they were trying to 'put ken back in his place' which I get is probably a metaphor for how modern day women are still treated however if you're trying to show feminism to a young audience it really needs to show actual feminism and not just toxic girl power. I would have loved for the ending to have involved an equal balance between the kens and the barbies to show what a real 'dream world' looks like. The Speeches felt very overdone and they suffocated the whole film. At least a quarter of the people in the cinema left half way through."
"This movie should have been for free and on the hallmark channel. So sappy, and preachy. It felt like it was trying too hard to get the message across when it could have been orchestrated better. Also all this hype and getting people to wear pink and excited for Barbie movie when the movie itself was completely opposite of the original Barbie. Like we get it, women have insecurities blah blah blah. We all know this. You didn't make us realize this in the movie. Idk in my opinion not worth spending your money to go watch this movie, just wait for it to go on Netflix and watch it at home!!!!!!!!"
"Right of the bat I should say that I only got interested in this movie because it featured Ryan Gosling - and honestly, if it wasn't for him, the movie wouldn't even get one star from me.The movie theater was filled with little girls, while I think this isn't really something a kid should be watching.It wasn't inspiring at all for me, nor did it make me emotional. The point wasn't really well made, in fact it mostly ended up being corny and worn-out. I really found it hard to sit through the whole movie, especially the ending scenes, I just wanted it to finally be over. Wasn't really worth all the hype and the money spent."
"Barbie is not carrying any knowledgeable and intelligent thing but carrying a lot of pink color.Movie shows anything but the talent of a director, writer, actor, actress.This shows which kind of knowledge and information standard we are passing to our next generation.Just for the sake of upcoming generation we should not create a legacy in the entertainment industry like 'Barbie'.Honestly this movie is a total reflection of comic fantasy nothing to do with the logic and the reality.Entertainment is not only about showing pink color this should be carry something valuable and the women's suffering as Barbie is trying to depict is already treated so we have to move to the next level and should try to depict more deepen level women suffering besides the body shaming thing because most of the world have been overcome this type of mentality already."
"To tell the truth, I expected the film to be something more than a beautiful picture with good actors and some funny comedy pieces. Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, Kate McKinnon: they all are my favourite actors. That was actually the reason to buy a ticket. But the film did really disappointed me.I liked the costumes and decorations, the topic of feminism, some jokes and musicals...but the way it was used is pretty confusing.First of all, the topic of feminism could have been described more... natural? Not just a woman telling other women that they are more than just servants for their men. It's true. But... really? Just men's riot, crying women and yes finally the thought of feminism. It's so trite. And it's all just for about...five minutes??? You took more time for these musical pieces that meant nothing but a waste of time. You should have used the screen time not for silly men running around the office or people dancing around good decorations, but for talking about the real point of the film (men and women: their life can be really good even without each other, because all of them are independent creatures. Women are strong and can be everyone they want as well as men do).As for me, the film could have been more structured. It seems like the first thought a person got in the morning and wrote everything that was in the head. It doesn't work like that. You don't have any structure in your film, except for plot. You use some strange moments with dancing people or a crazy riding car like in forza horizon, but for what? Is it a blockbuster or musical? These are good and I love musicals and blockbusters moments, but when they are really useful in the case they are used in, but in the film I didn't see the point of these ""juicy moments"".For me...it was the toy story, but with Barbie and the worst not structured subsequence of actions. Sorry but you had some of the best actors, the topic of feminism, good decorations... and just made the film thoughtless."
"Had so much more potential. This script was disastrous and felt like what you see in a disappointing sequel. Although Margot Robbie is a perfect cast and she does her job well, it's not enough to carry this movie alone. Ryan Gosling was the bright positive and main source of entertainment, especially during the first half of the film. Not the worst movie of the year but not the best of it's release week either.Overall feeling is Gerwig tried a little too hard with the story and ended up missing the point. I am still left with questions of objectives by certain story arcs. Ultimately they tried to be a little too deep, muddying the water and losing the crowd along the way."
"This movie has great visuals, and the clothes Barbie wears take me back to my childhood especially the barbie house! Unfortunately, this movie reminds me of a Faberge egg so nice on the outside and beautiful to look at, but there isn't much to see on the inside in this case. Such a waste of millions of dollars that went into this film, but yet there is only a nice beginning, and the rest of the movie is just filled with long dialogue, preachy preach lines that go on into tangents, and they make look guys look super dumb in this film which is messed up lol. I think I like the barbie doll and ken batter in toy story haha. By the way this movie is not for little ones! It will go over their heads LOL."
"So, the Barbie movie was ""meh""There's been a ton of hype about the film's political bent and honestly, yes... the patriarchal nonsense is a bit heavy handed but that's not even what made it so bad.It was just dumb.It was too long and nonsensical and I really don't know how to sum it up other than that.I laughed a couple of times and one or two parts almost resonated with me, but then it just went from relatable to preachy and I just eyerolled so hard.It was mostly just boring and dumb, and that's disappointing because it looked great, the cast was great, and it had such potential to be a great self-aware meta comedy. It just failed so hard at doing that.My summary: Barbie gains sentience, fights the patriarchy, becomes a real girl, and goes to the gynecologist.This movie will NOT appeal to young kids.I can almost guarantee they'll find it boring.It's not a typical kids movie riddled with double entendres and over-their-heads adult humor. It's just adult humor and it's not even particularly funny (just my opinion).It absolutely looks amazing, it looks like it was made with kids in mind, it looks like a nostalgia trip for moms, and it looks like family fun.However... with the exception of looking amazing, it accomplishes none of that. (The Mario Movie did all of those things sooo much better in my opinion. THAT movie was darn near perfect.)If you wanna see Barbie, go for it. But if you're considering taking little kids I would not personally recommend it. 😘"
"While the Barbie movie delivers a range of colorful and diverse visuals, casting, and thematic concepts, it just fell short for me in the way of substance and execution, leaving me wanting more.The physical makeup of the Barbie movie is most definitely a strong suit within the film. The set pieces, environments, and outfits, are all adequately colorful, visually pleasing, and reminiscent of early 90s to 00s Barbie marketing. The colorful cast of both recognizable and lesser known actors creates a diverse character list which is relatively cohesive with the overall plot(s). The character designs feel unique and refreshing while also remaining recognizable throughout. The sets and props feel whimsical and fun while also providing purpose and interesting context. They honestly created ""Barbieland"" perfectly, and are able to include clever visual jokes and references. However it can occasionally feel a little random or ""on the nose"" like they're just waiting for middle aged women in the audience to go ""oh my god! I had that when I was a kid! It's Barbie!"". Marketing genius but it may get old after some time. However. Barbie's plot. This is where Barbie fell short for me. It feels like directors of the movie spent a significant amount of time shoveling money into the visuals and IMMENSE amount of marketing for this movie, and with three months left they scrambled to put together a plot for the cast and set pieces. There are multiple plots strung together very loosely that feel disjointed. Because of this, none of the thematic concepts are explored adequately and it's difficult to feel much of anything for any one of the characters. Character development happens very quickly and anytime we think we're going to receive a more complex character, their facade melts and they are revealed to be a relatively one sided representation of a specific idea or character role. Barbie: the naive stereotypical perfectionist who developed depth after very quickly coming to terms with change.. and her own mortality? Ken: the weak, insecure man reliant on a woman who develops a sigma facade to stick it to the women controlling his life - but in actuality he is wounded from her rejection. The mother: she's a mom. She has a teenage daughter who she has trouble connecting with. Where have I heard this before? The daughter: a one-sided representation of a ""woke"" teenager who's angst is never explored outside of ""she's just a moody teenager"" , despite this, it is still an integral plot line that is never developed. We are never shown the daughter's transition or possible trauma leading to her developing hatred for her extremely caring and loving parents. All of this is CONSTANTLY being shoved down our throats. None of the character development or themes are very subtle, instead opting for explicit mentions of gender roles, patriarchy, fascism, ""political correctness"" and aloof representations of men in power. While these are all great concepts to explore, they are all tackled simultaneously, and thus executed poorly. In an attempt to avoid confusion, I assume?, these concepts are constantly and directly shown to audience members - even with Ken literally learning the definition of a patriarchy in the library and having that be his motivator for the rest of the film. This easily victimizes women and strips male characters of any and all complexity - reducing them to caricaturas lacking any real substance. There were a few times where the cinematography gave the plot a moment of fresh air, adding scenic and thematic complexity, such as when Barbie first looks around in the real world and sees others experiencing human emotion, before accepting the duality of happiness and pain as a part of organic psychology. However these moments are often overshadowed by reverting character arcs or other themes deemed to momentarily be more important. All in all Barbie offers a fun story attempting introspection in multiple parts, but falls short in its execution of those deeper concepts and ideas, instead opting for cinematic multitasking of the highest degree. Many scenes don't make very much sense or contribute to the plot, but it does still offer a nostalgic exploration of childhood, growing up, and humanity. Admittedly it does have a pretty great soundtrack (Billies song may have brought a tear to my eye despite me not caring about Barbies sudden want to become human, but that's because of that falsetto, wow 😻). And Ice Spice and Niki's rendition of Aquas Barbie girl had both me and my boyfriend wanting to buss a move out of the theatre."
"I would like to start by saying that Ryan Gosling delivers an impressive performance as Ken, truly standing out in the film with his remarkable portrayal. However, the movie doesn't quite meet the marketed expectations, opting for a more adult, satirical, and meta-commentary approach instead of the anticipated lighthearted comedy, which may make it less enjoyable for some who were expecting different things . The visuals and humor can be excessive at times, possibly detracting from the overall experience. Additionally, the movie's direct handling of its message , while thought-provoking, might polarize viewers."
"It's true, any other movie would've been better.I was really looking forward to seeing Barbie! Thought it would be more fun & bring back a lot of childhood memories. I was expecting a light and airy movie.However, the message was disappointing to me. I also found myself looking at the time hoping it would be over soon. They preached that this movie was for ""everyone"" & am so thankful that there weren't any children in the theater when I saw it because I do not think it was appropriate for younger aged kiddos.Will still always love Barbie & Margot Robbie just wish this would've been better!"
"I'll preface by saying the movie is hilarious, has a ton of iconic moments, and is definitely worth the watch.But, this is a big BUT, as a woman I think it fell flat in its feminist ideas.It basically, as usual, defined womanhood by motherhood which is a critical pitfall in my opinion, especially with a prominent cast member being a trans woman - making it a pristine opportunity to at least add a single line about women stepping away from the mother's role, and how it doesn't define our femininity or us as women.The movie also failed in showing the negative effects of patriarchy on men themselves.And while its plot contained a revolution it ended with a return to status quo, as usual for Hollywood, can't change, eh?It had a very good premise to show the negatives of both matriarchy and patriarchy, and choose to present what true equality might look like, but chose not to.It made the entire message fall flat. And since this philosophy played a big role in the plot itself, I feel like it was very disappointing."
"This movie is about women and how they are suppressed in the real world. The concept is good but the way they portrayed it is straight up boring in the film. Greta gerwig did not live up to her full potential while making this film. The first half of the film was fun and had a bit of humour . Anything after the first half was just a stretch. Anyone going to watch the movie in the theatre I would suggest you guys not go just wait for the ott release. If someone even wants to go ,go for the hype not to expect anything from it . Well only reason I even gave a four star was because i can't imagine anyone else playing the role of barbie and ken( Margot robbie and Ryan Gosling) they were great."
"The organisation of the movie is very poor. The edits are pretty bad at some points (e.g. Vision sequence which would be too long evenif it were used for a scene of someone who lost vision getting it back). I find the movie very hypocritical. It wants to be everything, but is not ready to commit to anything. It has feministic elements in painfully obvious preachy ways, but then undercuts it by showing the solution in the movie is equally bad (the movie doesn't discuss it, of course; it just tries to be funny by being meta). I think movie-goers have to a make a stand against such run-of-the-mill formulas of movie-making.PS: I made this account to review this movie. But, I am pointing out facts. Also, I intent to write reviews for other movies. A poorly made movie just forced me to finally make an account, that's all :)"
"***SPOILERS**Took my girls (7,10,13)to see this last night and they all loved it (bright colours, songs, some comedy) as they didnt understand fully the political message. They make it clearly obvious in the beginning of the movie that all the kens are irrelevant in their matriarchal society, there just to accompany the barbies, so much so that they make this fact into a joke, some things happen, a patriarchal society ensues, the barbies now don't like being in the Kens old position and are shown now as being oppressed (which is now no longer funny) and change it back to a matriarchal society, where the Kens are again walked over (see them not allowed a single ken on the supreme court). They had the chance to send a clear message to the viewers that men and women could be equal and everyone gets a fair shot, but instead used the pettiness of ""women had to endure this so now men should"" approach and I did not like that message for my daughters who I teach they can do anything they put their mind to. Someone needs to teach them that we're not in the 50s no more.On a better note- the cinematography is brilliant, Margot Robbie works well with the material she has, Ryan Gosling is brilliant as usual, Will Ferral is typically Will Ferral, there's some really funny bits in there too, but don't see this movie if you want a funny escape. It's feminist propaganda."
I can be honest and say as a child I didn't love Barbie's but that doesn't mean I wasn't excited to see this film. It was nostalgic in terms of costumes and the set but I just didn't really understand the flow of the movie. Plus the underlying message of equality was beaten to death and honestly kinda had the opposite effect.Start of SPOILERSThe movie starts out with a funny skit on how Barbie was created/imagined. It then flows into how Barbie is perfect in every way and everyday is the same in Barbie land. Things then seem to change when the standard Barbie starts thinking about death which idk seems a little harsh for a child's toy. Like maybe an existential crisis of some sort would have been less triggering. Then the movie moves into leaving Barbie land for the real world to make Barbie happy again but it pretty much does the exact opposite. While Barbie is gone the Ken's take over and change all the Barbie things about Barbie Land. Once Barbie returns she recruits all the other Barbies they take back Barbie land.End of SPOILERSNow from a readers perspective I'm sure it's very easy to follow that summary but in the actual movie there's a lot more in between moments that just didn't really belong in the movie. And to be honest a lot of the unnecessary stuff was basically advertisement for Chevy and other brands.All in all this movie had some funny moments but was mostly a disappointment for me and I honestly regret even taking the time to see it.
"Very poor plot, very stupid way to try yo showcase a problem that is not even the real problem. A perfect example of how marketing tells people what to think and how mass manipulación works. Incredible missguided message to the youngest generations, that movie impersonales everything that is wrong with hollywood. Surprising a lot of peolple feel confy and supports that.Something to rescue, Margot acting is good. The effort in recreating Barbie 's world is noted.For the rest, a lot of escenes that takes you nowhere, a lot of caracteres that doesn't make any sense. A fraudulent naive attemp of making it look as if it was an intellectual and deep movie, what a waste of time."
"If ur over 13 this movie will most definitely bore you. The movie tried so hard to make a point yet still failed.The cast was amazing but the plot didn't do much
I see how the writers tried to make the movie show us the double standards when it comes to woman rights but honestly they did such a bad job at that. I really hoped this movie would actually be as meaningful as the writers intended it to be but it was just a very bad comedy.a very bad representation of woman and just overall a bad movie.It could be fun for passing time and for girls night, but don't expect to be amazed by it.cause you will be disappointed."
"The movie started well then missed a perfect chance of a beautiful empathetic ending.I was expecting that once Barbie visited the real world, she would understand how Ken felt in her world. Decide that no superiority should be instigated neither in a sense nor in another, and hence come best with a better plan of equality to show the lead for a better world. Which would have been a perfect message modern women would give.But here we got zero empathy for Ken, rather a plan to manipulate men and empower them back (that's the point?).I'm honestly surprised they get away with such an ending."
"Too many sexual references and doesn't grasp the concept of barbie. The production and crew could have done a lot more with this movie to draw more attention. Like again I said in the title waste of time. With also not adding enough in the movie they have also tried too much on the set and dressing designs, but the cast for the movie was okay with me but instead of Ryan gosling as Ken Freddy Prinze Jr. Instead. With this movie I feel sad that production made this movie PG-13. Because the age group of people that lobve barbie are 5-9 year Olds. But parents can take their children to see babies but kids will not find it exciting with all of the adult jokes and references."
"The film goes around feminism and such. Its message is quite good and I agree with it. But the movie itself is the worst movie I have ever seen. Its made for like 2 years olds but with expressions that only adults van understand. It was painful to sit through the two hours play time because nothing really happened and every caracter was annoying. Not just annoying but also very simple. It seemed like noone had any brain. They are talking to everyone like you would talk to a two year old.There isnt really a plot to follow, just two straight hours of whining and nerve-wracking dialoges.For the love of god don't watch this movie. It takes away two hours of you life.After the movie everyone I could hear (including girls) was saying that this was waaaaay worse than anyone expected. So please spare yourself."
"Positives:
Barbie is an objectively good movie when you consider it's aspects as a film. The set design is amazing in the Barbie world, and this combined with the amazing wardrobe really makes you feel like this world actually could exist. These two things are a real standout for me, and is everything you could hope for from a Barbie movie. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling play an amazing Barbie and Ken. Something I did not expect was how much I liked Michael Cera's performance as Allan. I feel like his performance gave the film as sense of awkward relief which I enjoyed. Although I touch on why I really didn't like the storytelling aspect of Barbie in the negatives section, I do like how the film builds this metaphor between the relationship of Barbie's and Ken's and the relationship of men and women.Negatives:
Barbie is movie where you are not allowed to think for yourself. One of my favorite aspects about storytelling is it's ability to communicate a message in disarming ways. The type of movie where you buy into the message either implicitly or explicitly through exposition of the characters struggles. Movies that forgo this buy in from the audience are more or less just preaching an idea rather than trying to convince or demonstrate an idea. This is really where I have problems with the Barbie movie. While the causes pushed for in the movie are noble, they are so inelegant and on the nose it really does feel like you are being talked at through the entire movie. I cannot tell you a single theme, subtext, or message that the movie was trying to convey that wasn't also explicitly conveyed in dialogue between the characters. Consider something like the dialogue between Barbie and Ken after the Barbie's stopped the Ken's from changing the constitution after Ken returned from the human world with his new idea of patriarchy. In this dialogue, is the only way to convey the idea of not defining your self worth based on others and/or your material possessions is by Barbie saying almost exactly that, but in not so few words? Are the characters so superficial that any attempt to demonstrate that point through self reflection and/or actions would just completely fall flat? This is not an isolate incident either, I would challenge anybody to find either a theme, subtext, or any social/political statement that they movie tries to convey that isn't in some dialogue somewhere where it is almost explicitly stated as such. This issue really makes the movie feel shallow and superficial and uninteresting to watch after a certain point."
"The only reason this movie even gets a 2 from me is because Margot Robbie is a beautiful woman. It's 2 hours of my life I will never get back. A waste of money to see. Will Ferrell plays his usual ridiculous self as all of his roles. Ryan Gosling also has a role that is beneath him. Margot Robbie is a great actress and so much more capable than this role. A definite don't see this movie. It should have an age rating no one over the age of eight years old allowed unless accompanied by a toddler. Yes, it was that bad. An embarrassment to all who acted in this movie. The writers should be ashamed. This may be all that Hollywood is capable of during a writers strike. Hopefully there will not be a sequel to this God awful movie. I only saw it because my wife wanted to see it for some strange reason. I would have to say it's the worst movie I have ever paid to see hands down. So not waste your time or your money to go to this movie. Wait for it to go to video. It shouldn't take long."
"Is this film aimed at children? If so, why the vagina and penis jokes?Is it a feminist film that critiques the patriarchy and the objectivisation of women? If so, why are so many women objectified (not in an ironic way).The acting was terrible, Margot Robbie is awful, Gosling rings it in, and guess what, we have the tween girl who's fallen out with her mother and just basically rolls her eyes in embarrassment.Will Ferrell, is well, Will Ferrell, what you see is what you get (aka terrible acting and just one gormless face).The sets (which for some reason people have described as stunning) look like a cheap school set. Honestly had better effects at my kids primary school nativity."
"I'm NOT a Barbie girl in NOT the Barbie World, Life in plastic, It's NOT fantastic. In the beginning of the film, it can be thought that will go nice way with a good end and a powerful message. There is so much effort in the beginning, like building a strong idea, however this is disappered in the final. And this is such a disappointment that the film does nothing about giving an idea about liberal feminism because there is always managers as boys or girls. I think the film's main idea should be every human being no matter it is a boy or a girl can be everything they want and can be handle every situation as a human. It is ridiculous to discuss this as ""being a man or a woman"" in the 2023. In the Barbie world or in the real world it should be out of date. The final should be reviewed with this manner cause the expactation was very high with this huge-budget film..."
"This is my first review at imdb and tbh I really wanted to love this movie I did. But it just didn't work for me. It was a movie, it had Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling in it but it was nothing groundbreaking. Rather, some metaphors were made that didn't land, Some social commentary was mixed which while I totally get it but It just didn't deliver. The plot had loose ends and loopholes. I also couldn't connect with Margot despite her being the leading role. It just was a disappointment. Especially after all the publicity and riot that this movie is on social media. You can watch the movie. It's watchable but thats all that I can say about it."
"Some things were super clever and made me laugh. Ryan Gosling's Ken was awesome..he was the best part. There were definitely elements I appreciated and I thought were thought provoking; however, it just felt so political and so forced. It was a huge social commentary which I think can be great but it wasn't seamlessly blended it, it was kinda obnoxious and redundant. Plot was sometimes boring and the storyline about real world meets fake world felt a little bit cliche! Certain moments were just too corny. Did I laugh though? Definitely. It had its moments. I agree with the High Highs and Low lows statements."
